14832|2018-11-30|15:00||http://otaquest.com/kirby-ice-cream-cake/| News | Games | Kirby to Become an Ice Cream Cake in Namco Arcade Pupupu Diner Collaboration | N/A |Kirby’s had quite a busy year in 2018. They received a brand new game with the release of Kirby Star Allies on Nintendo Switch, the Kirby Cafe, which originally opened for a limited time in 2016, reopened within Tokyo Skytree in September, and now they’re set to receive their own ice cream sandwich that is being made by Cold Stone Creamery. Unusually, this isn’t going to be an ice cream you can walk into a shop and buy, or one where you can get it in a themed cafe, or even one of the various Cold Stone Creamery stores dotted around Japan. Instead, these ice creams will only be available in a variety of Namco Arcades around the country as part of the ‘Kirby Campaign: Pupupu Diner in Namco’ event which is due to start in a few days time. The description of the ice cream does make it sound like something you’ll want to try for yourself, though. This ice cream sandwich contains Sweet Cream Ice Cream with diced strawberries mixed into the ice cream itself. Each of the sandwiches are colored pink with a Kirby Pupupu Diner illustration printed onto the top. Personally, as someone who loves strawberries and who loves ice cream (and who thinks Kirby is very cute), this is something I’d love to get the chance to try for myself. As mentioned before, this is part of a wider Kirby campaign being held at Namco arcades, with special prizes being introduced to change game machines for a limited time during the event. These include Pupupu Diner Kirby plush toys, cutlery sets, cups, smaller keychain plushes and, if you use the Namco Point mobile application to spend 500 yen or 1000 yen on a crane game machine, you will receive a coupon for a limited edition sticker or a code to enter a lottery for a Pupupu Kirby blanket. Although some of the prizes will be available from December 2, the ice cream sandwich will not be available until December 7. For a full look at the ice cream sandwich and all things related to the Namco Arcade Pupupu Diner collaboration event and the ice cream Kirby sandwich, you can visit the official website for the campaign or Cold Stone Creamery’s website.|Kirby, Cold Stone Creamery, Cold Stone, Kirby Ice Cream, Kirby Cake

For the November emotion, PARK noticed a general "dullness" to the air in Tokyo, resulting in them calling on Riho Kurokawa, an illustrator and creative who specializes in dark, often bleak illustrations that could perfectly capture this "dull" feeling. Describing Tokyo as a "dull city that never sleeps", it's pretty obvious where designer Riho Kurokawa's feelings towards the city stand, but it's through those feelings that she's able to put together some genuinely incredible imagery showcasing why she became an obvious choice for the project. Alongside the release of the November EMOtee, PARK Harajuku has additionally been hosting an art gallery dedicated to Riho Kurokawa in-store, something that is definitely worth checking out if you're in the Harajuku area. Available now in-store and online from PARK Harajuku, the Riho Kurokawa collaborative piece is but a small part of PARK's ever-developing plan to give independent creators a voice in Tokyo's fashion and design landscape. While the theme that Kurokawa has chosen to tackle may be "dull", her illustration and design sensibilities are anything but. Those interested in checking out further information about the collection, be sure to head to PARK Harajuku's official website.|Riho Kurokawa, PARK, Park Harajuku, EMOtee, Tokyo EMOtee, Emo tee

Moreover, the companies have partnered with Alcon Television Group to give us a deeper look into the complicated realm of replicants while expanding the universe of the storied franchise. The 13-episode series will be titled Blade Runner — Black Lotus. Not much is known about the series at this time but it is being reported that it will take place in 2032, which puts it on the timeline almost directly between the two flagship films, Ridley Scott’s classic, Blade Runner, and the recent blockbuster, Blade Runner 2049. Likewise, details have emerged that it will feature some of the more prominent characters of the cinematic franchise. My guess is that Niander Wallace will play a pivotal role in the series with Rick Deckard, K, and Joi making some subtle appearances. Blade Runner — Black Lotus will be produced by Sola Arts with all 13 episodes being directed by Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) and Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed.) Moreover, it was announced that the genius behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, Shinichiro Watanabe, will be the creative producer of the series, so you just know that the new series is going to be quite memorable. This is not the first time that Blade Runner has made the leap into anime. Back in 2017, Watanabe directed a short anime film titled Blade Runner Black Out 2022 that coincided with two other short anime films. All three of them were released online to correspond with the premiere of Blade Runner 2049. The news of Blade Runner — Black Lotus comes alongside the recent reveal that Titan Comics and Alcon Media Group will work with Blade Runner 2049’s screenwriter Michael Green on an upcoming comic book project. This all means that the world that Ridley Scott created with the original 1982 film is far from ending anytime soon and the stories set in the Blade Runner universe are only going to get deeper for the fans that are hungry for more. Let’s just hope that Harrison Ford will not be doing any voice-overs on this series. |Blade Runner, Blade Runner Black Lotus, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, Blade Runner - Black Lotus -, Shinichiro Watanabe, Crunchyroll, adult swim, Kenji Kamiyama, Shinji Aramaki

Funimation announced that the 2001 anime series will be rebooted with the story following the entirety of Natsuki Takaya's original manga. The series will air on TV Tokyo and be available to stream on FunimationNow in 2019. If you can remember back to twelve years ago in 2005, then you may know that fans of the 2001 series made a plea for a second season to be made. They folded over 1,000 origami cranes at anime conventions for Funimation Entertainment with the wish that it will convince Studio Deen to greenlight a new season. However, these cranes were made just to go in recycling as a new season was ill-fated. Those same fans can rejoice now with a new Fruits Basket series on its way. But don't be mistaken, this is not a second season; this is a completely new series. Even if you didn't find yourself enjoying the original series, the reboot is worth a view with an entirely new cast and crew, which was specifically requested by Natsuki Takaya herself. As I said above, the story will also follow the entirety of the original manga from the very beginning to the very end, a departure from the original series. People have not been shy to state their opinions on the reboot with some wondering why there needs to be one and others giving their support, including the former voice actor for Kyo Sohma, one of the main characters of the series, as well as Tomokazu Seki, who tweeted out his support and excitement for the new series. I, personally, am excited to see a new series in the works and am anxious to see how it comes out.|Fruits Basket, FunimationNow, Funimation

Then we have good news for you! Eleven Arts announced via Twitter that the gripping romantic drama is getting another brief run in U.S. theaters early next year. So if you did miss out on the movie theater experience and live in the United States, grab your keys and head over to one of the select theaters screening the film when it is showing on January 15 and 17, 2019. If you are unfamiliar with the Kyoto Animation film, then we have you covered before you are trying to decide whether to see the dubbed or subbed version. A Silent Voice is a feature-length anime film adapted from a manga of the same name written and illustrated by Yoshitoki Oima. The film is directed by renowned talent Naoko Yamada of K-On and Tamako Market fame and written by Reiko Yoshida. It was originally released in Japanese theaters in 2016, a year that also saw the releases of megahit cultural phenomenon your name. as well as Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare and Eiga Yo-kai Watch: Enma Daioh to Itsutsu no Monogatari da Nyan!. At the time, it was a diamond of a film and a visual delight that was somewhat lost among a sea of successful anime films in 2016. The touchy content and uneasy moments of A Silent Voice may not be as appealing as the dreamy story of your name. but the story leaves a strong impact not to be overlooked. It especially left one on me to the point where I can’t help but get teary eyed by simply watching the trailer. I definitely recommend seeing the film in theaters even if it is just to see the beauty of the animation on the big screen. Tickets for the film will go on sale on December 14 and you can purchase them on the Fathom Events website.

These often take place in packed concert halls where a full orchestra will play beloved tracks from a variety of mainline Final Fantasy titles. With the series having celebrated its 30th-anniversary last year, PlayStation Plus subscribers in Japan are being treated to a limited-time-only mouthful of a free application named ‘PMN Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy Jiritsu PS Plus Edition’. This application, which will be free for members between December 5 and February 28, will allow people to listen to music from the Distant Worlds 30th-anniversary concert held at Tokyo International Forum Hall A on December 10, 2017, in an uncompressed format, with matching gameplay videos being shown as the music plays. Alongside this app, on the same date, subscribers will also be able to download a Final Fantasy Distant Worlds PS4 theme for their console. There are some caveats to this, however. While the application is available to download and keep for PlayStation Plus members between the aforementioned dates, it will only work up until March 31, 2019, after which you will no longer be able to use it. Not only that, you won’t be able to subscribe to the PlayStation Plus service tomorrow and gain access to this application on the launch date. In order to download this app, people must have been subscribed to the service for at least 2 months before they will have access. Luckily, subscribing now will at least mean you can download this app before the availability period ends.

Coming in as a total departure from the group's usual hyper-vibrant visual style, the latest music video adopts a more toned-down style with a number of uniquely dempagumi spins that actually makes it one of their most interesting videos to date: We're just mere weeks away from what is possibly one of the most important albums in Dempagumi.inc's ten-year history, as well as the last album from the idol group to feature long-time member Yumemi Nemu. Set to release on January 1, 2019, the group's sixth studio album, "Ware Ware wa Dempagumi.inc da", is also the first album to feature both relative newcomers Rin Kaname and Nagi Nemoto, making it somewhat of a solid welcome and farewell. While it's still devestating that the group will be losing Yumemi Nemu as she proceeds to move out of the public eye, it remains a breath of relief that she'll be able to proceed on with the life she worked so hard towards. While there's a slight chance this might be the last music video from the group to feature her, it'd honestly surprise me. With a few weeks remaining before the release of the new album, there's every chance we'll be seeing even more music videos in the near future. |Dempagumi.inc, Dempagumi, Taiyokei Kansatsu Chu Seimeitai

It's a move that makes all too much sense, but definitely one that's got the OTAQUEST team excited; plans are already being made around the office to make our way to opening screenings in 4DX on December 14, 2018. From all of the teasers, trailers, and promotional material released for the film to date, there's an extreme level of hype surrounding the debut mainline feature-film featuring Broly, a fan-favorite character who up until now failed to make it into the mainline series canon. It's no secret that where Broly goes, destruction is likely to follow -- something that is probably going to be best experienced in 4DX, only adding to the relevancy of the film being announced in the format. While I've somehow failed to make my way to see a 4DX film in all my time in Japan, discussions with friends who have seen anime films in 4DX definitely have me excited. Really thinking about it, I don't think there's a better upcoming film to experience it for the first time with either, so I've now got both the film and the experience to look forward to too. Set to begin screening in theaters in Japan on December 14, and North America on December 16, we can't wait to check out Dragon Ball Super: Broly when it drops. Until then though, be sure to check out our full archives for further information on the upcoming film, here. |Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball, Broly, 4DX, Dragon Ball Super: Broly 4DX

Bandai Namco has since released the first details of the new changes that are being made for this game’s release on the hybrid console. While all features and characters from the original game on PS4 will be available in this new release, four new characters who made their debut in ‘Girls Und Panzer das Finale’ will be added. Mary, Ando, and Oshida from BC Freedom High School and Ogin from the Shark team of Ooarai Girls Academy will each have their video game debut in this Switch release, bringing the total number of characters to over 40. On top of the slate of new characters being introduced, multiple new tanks from the series, as well as a brand new eight-player local multiplayer mode is being added. All of these new features will be made available to PS4 owners through a special DLC set that will retail at 3,800 yen including Erika Itsumi as a character DLC or 3,500 yen for the DLC without her. To coincide with the game’s release in February, a special limited edition release containing a bonus movie on a Blu-ray disc, a keychain, a variety of art prints of many of the main characters in swimsuits, a calendar and more will be made available for an as-yet-unannounced price. The game is currently not set for a Western release, however, just like the original PS4 title, Dream Tank Match DX will be receiving an Asian Release in English on the same day as the game launches in Japan. The game will be released on February 21, 2019, with more details on the upcoming title made available via the game’s official website.|Girls und Panzer, Girls Und Panzer: Dream Tank Match DX, Dream Tank Match DX, Dream Tank Match, Nintendo Switch
14814|2018-11-29|12:00||http://otaquest.com/hoshiai-no-sora-anime-pv/| News | Anime | ‘Escaflowne’ Director Shares New PV for Upcoming Original Anime Project | N/A |Legendary anime director Akane Kazuki - known for such classics as The Vision of Escaflowne and Noein - is back with an all-new original project set to broadcast next year, which explores new horizons for the creator. Titled ‘Hoshiai no Sora,’ the series follows a middle school soft tennis club on the brink of being disbanded. The two protagonists, Katsura Gimaki (CV: Natsuki Hanae) and Shinjo Touma (CV: Tsuku Hatanaka) decide to aim for a top place at the summer championships to ensure the continued existence of the club, in a “down-to-earth coming of age story.” A PV for the upcoming project was shared by way of announcement, which you can check out below: Eightbit, who is currently busy with their two-cour adaptation of the light novel series That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime, will be handling the overall production alongside animation director and character designer Takahashi Yuichi, who has worked with the studio before on Knights & Magic. They’re clearly very focused on animating the show well, as they proudly show off some of their completed animation cuts in the trailer from their inception to the finished product. Akane, meanwhile, will be taking the triple role of director, writer, and producer. The director is mainly known for his sci-fi works, most recently directing and writing for the Code Geass: Akito the Exiled movies, so this type of coming of age story definitely isn’t normal for him. The director recognizes this, and commented that he wanted to try “a new challenge” and show people “a new world.” It’s always great to see creators trying something that’s a little out of their comfort zone, as this can lead to exciting new sides to their career that hasn’t yet been uncovered. Given Akane’s track record, I’m crossing my fingers that this coming of age story will be a success. The series is set to air sometime next year.|Hoshiai no Sora, Escaflowne, Code Geass, eightbit, The Vision of Escaflowne, Akane Kazuki
14812|2018-11-29|11:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/eevee-tamagotchi-sold-out/| News | Games | Eevee Tamagotchi Sells Out Before Release | N/A |While the immediate response to our recent write-up on the upcoming collaborative efforts of The Pokémon Company's new flagship character Eevee and Bandai's own Tamagotchi line of toys was beyond excited, it turns out those somewhat overwhelming levels of hype have led to a slight consumer problem. With the upcoming Eevee x Tamagotchi devices set to release on January 26, 2019, pre-orders went live earlier this week for eager fans to ensure their device; and, well, they sold out -- immediately. Though this would generally be considered a positive thing, the unfortunate reality of the situation saw the vast majority of the device pre-orders making their way to resellers looking for an easy buck. Oh, and what an easy buck it's proving to be. With an RRP of around 2,300 yen here in Japan, the Eevee x Tamagotchi was slated to be an affordable little piece of fun that wasn't going to break the bank. But those who failed to get their hands on a pre-order and don't want to risk the wait, you're looking at spending around 6,500 yen individually, or 15,000 yen for the set. There's still a couple of months standing between us and the release of the Eevee x Tamagotchi, however, so it's likely that we'll be seeing a number of restocks before the device actually releases. What this means, of course, is that you really shouldn't be rushing to go spend anywhere near 15,000 yen for a device originally slated to cost 2,300 yen. Though, with that being said, there's nothing stopping the next sets of pre-orders from being hit by scalpers as well, something I'm sure will drive die-hard Eevee and Tamagotchi fans to make the jump. I guess we'll just have to see how this one plays out.|Eevee Tamagotchi, Pokemon, Tamagotchi, Eevee, Pokemon Tamagotchi
14810|2018-11-29|10:00||http://otaquest.com/fate-grand-order-gen-urobuchi-return/| News | Anime , Games | Gen Urobuchi Returns to ‘Fate’ Series to Oversee New ‘Grand Order’ Scenario | N/A |The mobile game Fate/Grand Order has been a runaway success for the larger Fate series ever since it launched all the way back in 2015, and fans have only continued to support the game as it has gone from strength to strength in terms of writing, gameplay and overall direction. Nothing pays testament to that more than the excellent news of the homecoming of none other than Gen Urobuchi to the franchise to oversee the scenario of the third chapter of the second part of the game’s main story. Urobuchi got his start as a writer with his Fate/Zero novels, which tell the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War ten years before the events of the original Fate/stay night, which then went on to form the basis for one of the most gorgeous anime of all time. Even if critics disagree on the quality of the story and characters of the anime, they all definitely agree that the visuals have never been topped by any anime since, bringing in theatrical levels of production values to each and every episode. Following this success, Urobuchi moved into writing for anime full-time, penning various projects over the years, such as the incredibly successful Puella Magi Madoka Magica, the ill-fated Aldnoah.Zero, the challenging Psycho-Pass, and the recent puppet show Thunderbolt Fantasy. But now, after almost ten years away from the franchise to pursue those other projects, Urobuchi is back. That being said, Urobuchi did oversee the 2016 Fate/Accel Zero Order event in Grand Order, which saw many of his Fate/Zero characters being added to the game, but that wasn’t part of the main story nor of the main canon. However, that doesn’t mean that he’s forgotten about his beloved Zero characters, as the new craft essences being added into the game for the new main story chapter are themed after none other than Tokiomi Tohsaka, Waver Velvet and Aoi Tohsaka. Check them out below: Given that Urobuchi now works for Nitroplus, it’s great that he’s taken time out of his no-doubt busy schedule to help oversee the new main story chapter. Although he’s officially just supervising, I’m sure that at least some of his trademarks will make an appearance - so don’t get too attached to any of the new characters. They might come to a rather sticky end...|Fate/Grand Order, Fate, FGO, Gen Urobuchi
14804|2018-11-28|16:00||http://otaquest.com/netflix-ultraman-anime/| News | Anime | New Trailer Revealed for Netflix’s 'Ultraman' Anime | N/A |Amidst Netflix’s slew of anime-related announcements these past few days emerges a fresh new look at their upcoming Ultraman anime series. Serving as a follow up from last year’s teaser, this trailer provides fans with a long-awaited look into what they can expect from the anime series before its April 1, 2019 launch. In case you didn’t recognize the name, Ultraman is one of the more prominent Japanese Tokusatsu series, going as far as spawning a whole sub-genre known as the "Ultra Series". The anime adaptation will be covering the ongoing sequel manga of the same name (with the story handled by Eiichi Shimizu and art by Tomohiro Shimoguchi). This story follows Shinjiro, the son of Shin Hayata (the original Ultraman), as he battles the returning alien forces through the help of his inherited “Ultraman Factor”. For many fans, this trailer confirms their suspicions: the heavy use of CG does not look to be all that promising. There are multiple shots in the trailer where the low frame rate doesn’t do it justice, and the all too familiar “choppiness” of 3D animation makes itself prominent. This is especially true for the first half of the trailer, where numerous discrepancies can be observed. This is upsetting given how this fall season’s tokusatsu series, SSSS.Gridman, has been able to utilize both 3D and 2D in order to full heartedly deliver on the campiness of it’s action sequences while not detracting from its core anime experience. Regardless, the trailer is able to pull through at the end, giving us fans a glimpse of the ever-iconic Ultraman Beam leaving us wanting more. The project will be a combined effort between Production I.G. and Sola Digital Arts, with Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) and Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed) coming in to direct from each studio respectively. Given Aramaki’s history of mechanical design, it’s no surprise that he would come to work on a series like this. The same duo has also been slated to be working on the upcoming Ghost in the Shell anime, splitting the work down the middle. It will be interesting to see whether they will adopt a similar approach for Ultraman. |Ultraman, Netflix, Netflix Anime, Ultraman Netflix
14803|2018-11-28|15:00||http://otaquest.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-trailers-december/| News | Games | Three New Kingdom Hearts III Trailers Scheduled for December | N/A |As the release date for Kingdom Hearts III gets ever closer, and after the news that development on the title was now complete, fans have begun to receive a glut of new trailers to promote what is set to be one of the biggest new releases for the beginning of 2019. Just last week we reported on the game’s most recent trailer, the "Together" trailer, which was an extended version of a trailer that was playing in American cinemas. Things got taken a little further, however, with the announcement that three more trailers are set to be released before we say goodbye to 2018. According to an announcement from the official Japanese Twitter account for the Kingdom Hearts franchise, they dated and gave brief details on the contents of three new upcoming trailers that were set for release in December. The first of these trailers is set for December 10, and is promised to be a brand new trailer that contains new content not shown off in previous advertising for the game. The second of these trailers is set for one week later on December 18 and is simply being described as the ‘final’ trailer. With that description, it would be best to expect the longest and most in-depth trailer to date with the final pieces of new content that will be shared prior to the game’s launch. However, there will be one more trailer after this ‘final’ one. This promises to be a short, 30-second long commercial designed to be shown in movie theatres. It is likely that, since the "Together" trailer was designed for American movie theatres, this refers to an advertisement geared at a Japanese audience. In any case, with the January 29 launch date for Kingdom Hearts III looming, the confirmation of further information for excited fans will surely satisfy them during the long final two months of waiting before the game releases.|Kingdom Hearts III, Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts 3, KH3, Square Enix
14802|2018-11-28|14:00||http://otaquest.com/new-fate-anime-troyca/| News | Anime | New ‘Fate’ Anime Announced for 2019 by Studio TROYCA | N/A |Although the Fate/Grand Order mobile game may be the golden boy of the long-running Fate franchise right now, the series has always enjoyed a generally excellent slew of anime adaptations over the years -- which is why many fans were excited to hear the announcement of an all-new Fate anime during a recent informational stream on November 27. The following key visual was shared as a way of announcement during the stream, which has many fans speculating on what the series could be: With the structure of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster featuring so prominently in the key visual, it seems obvious that the new anime will take place in the city of London. Coincidentally, one key Fate property that takes place in London is an ongoing light novel series centered on Lord El-Melloi II, titled Lord El-Melloi II Case Files, which follows El-Melloi and his apprentice as they investigate mysteries in the magical world. Therefore, many fans were quick to assume that this new anime would be an adaptation of that series. Yet, it’s equally possible that the series could end up being an original work simply revolving around the city of London, and perhaps the Mages’ Association who call the city their home. TROYCA, the studio handling production for the new series, have also produced a fair few original anime over the years, such as the recent Re:CREATORS and their debut project Aldnoah.Zero. Perhaps TYPE-MOON will give them a bit more creative freedom this time - especially since the last two anime adaptations from the series didn’t go down too well, those being Fate/Apocrypha and Fate/Extra Last Encore. Nevertheless, the new anime - whatever it may be - is set to broadcast sometime in 2019. It joins the television broadcast of the first Heaven’s Feel movie and a new, 3-hour Grand Order television special on upcoming anime projects for the series.|TYPE-MOON, Fate, Fate/Stay Night, Troyca, Lord El-Melloi II Case Files
14801|2018-11-28|13:00||http://otaquest.com/pop-team-epic-mobile-game/| News | Games | ‘Pop Team Epic’ Releases First Mobile Game | N/A |Although Pop Team Epic may have finished it’s chaotic twelve episode anime run back in January (was it really that long ago?), Popuko and Pipimi aren’t done quite just yet. 12:30 on Wednesday saw the surprise release of the series’ first mobile game, titled Takeshobo Quest ~Pop Team Epic Assaults~, on all major smartphone marketplaces. In the game, you control a team of Takeshobo employees as they withstand the assault of Popuko and Pipimi on their employer, in a real-time strategy game that is sure to be filled to the brim with the series’ trademark off-the-wall humor and general weirdness. The release of the game came with the rather surprising announcement that your first pull on the gacha would net you 10,000 gacha tickets to use, which may seem incredible at first glance, but actually makes sense when you consider that the only way to gain more units for your team is by using the gacha, and you tend to go through units quite quickly as you battle Popuko and Pipimi in the various stages. Therefore, you might very well need 10,000 pulls just to play the game properly.​ It would be useful to comment on the gameplay, but unfortunately, at the time of writing, the servers for the game are undergoing maintenance. It seems like a strange time to schedule maintenance since the game just launched, but it does mean that any gameplay impressions will have to be left to a later date. That being said, it can be gleaned from the various screenshots and the press release that the battles for the game will play out “automatically,” so the main source of strategy will supposedly come from setting up your team correctly before battle.

This game, titled Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box in North America and Professor Layton and Pandora’s Box in Europe, was originally released in 2007 in Japan and 2009 in the rest of the world and is now set for a re-release on mobile devices. Over the years since the series debuted in Japan, the series has seen the successful release of 6 mainline games featuring the titular character released on Nintendo DS and 3DS alongside a crossover game with Phoenix Wright, a mobile game titled Layton Brothers, a surprisingly-well-made film and, last year, a new spin-off title named Layton Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaire’s Conspiracy for 3DS and mobile which is currently receiving an anime adaptation. Due to these games only being previously available on the now-discontinued Nintendo DS, many people no longer have a way to experience these older and well-loved games. With the gradual move to smartphones in the handheld market and the massive amount of people using such devices every day, these new versions of these classic games give many people a chance to discover these titles for the very first time in an updated form. This new updated version of the second game in the Professor Layton franchise is set for a release on an unspecified date in December for the price of 1200 yen. Although an international release is currently unannounced for this game, the mobile port of Professor Layton and the Curious Village did release in English worldwide a few months after its Japanese counterpart, making it likely that a Western release will follow in early next year.

From yesterday's announcement that Neon Genesis Evangelion will be coming to the streaming service, an announcement that proved a massive win for fans of the medium as a whole, all the way to today's slew of announcements, there's possibly no better time to be a fan of anime than right now. With that being said, Netflix's latest announcement takes this to a whole new level, something I don't think any of us saw coming at all. Guess it’s time to announce that Cowboy Bebop, the live-action series, is heading to @Netflix. pic.twitter.com/bKe0d8EKoH — NX (@NXOnNetflix) 28 November 2018 While we've known for some time that Cowboy Bebop would be receiving a live-action adaptation, it comes as a massive shock that Netflix will be hosting the series exclusively on their services. But it doesn't stop there -- Netflix went in and doubled down on themselves with the announcement that they have brought on original series creator Shinichiro Watanabe to consult for the series. This comes as a total shock given his generally muted interest in any live-action adaptation, something he's expressed over the years in numerous interviews. Perhaps it was the fact that Netflix got involved that grabbed his interest, but regardless it can only be a good thing. Though there was little information shared about the upcoming live-action adaptation, it'll be interesting to see just how much it diverges from the murmurs that were floating around when the project was originally announced. We're hoping we'll be seeing some new information shared in the coming months, and we'll be sure to keep you updated when that time comes. Until then, be sure to check out our interview with Shinichiro Watanabe where we discussed his legendary career and more, here.|Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe, Netflix, Netflix Anime, Cowboy Bebop Live-action

This will be available on Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets, while also being available in a non-VR package on PC. While relatively few details have been shared since the project was originally announced in July last year, it had been confirmed that the original cast of the anime will be returning for this VR experience and that it will share some similarities to the studio’s previous project, ‘Project Lux’. The game will also include English subtitles for international fans. Although it had been announced that a Japanese crowdfunding campaign would launch on Campfire alongside a Kickstarter campaign for worldwide backers on November 25th, only the Campfire campaign is currently live at this point. However, it doesn’t seem as though these issues have impacted the project too much, with palpable excitement for the game allowing it to easily surpass its 8,000,000 yen campaign goal in just 2 hours. In the time since then, this figure has grown even more, with the current total at the time of writing standing at 18,151,800yen. Many of the most expensive tiers for this campaign have also already sold out and are no longer available, including a 400,000 yen tier that included a specially made original short movie where Holo would answer a question for you as well as short message where she would say your name, while also including a ‘commemorative tombstone’ and signed voice acting scripts and framed artwork. For fans of Spice and Wolf, this new project looks set to expand on the world of these novels in an interesting new way. The Kickstarter campaign for international fans is set to begin next week, while the game is set for release in 2019.

When you think of Final Fantasy, arguably before you think of the series’ most iconic story moments, the first thing that comes to mind is the "Chocobo Theme" or the "Victory Fanfare". The Dragon Quest series is very difficult to disassociate from its iconic main theme, while the NieR series is widely revered for the amazing soundtrack produced by composer Keiichi Okabe. In turn, many of their soundtracks receive special rearrangements that prove popular with fans of the games who want to experience the soundtracks with a new perspective. Following the widespread success of Octopath Traveler on Nintendo Switch, which was recently announced to have surpassed 1 million copies sold worldwide, Square Enix has announced the first arrangement album for the title, named "Break and Boost". This special album will take 12 tracks from the game’s soundtrack and give each of them new arrangements. Following the album’s name, this will be split into a ‘Break Side’ and a ‘Boost Side’, with a different theme for the remixes based on this. The tracks on the Break Side will be brand new piano arrangements of the selected songs, while the tracks on the ‘Boost Side’ are band arrangements. The track list for this album is as follows: Break Side:- 1. The Frostlands 2. Primrose, The Dancer 3. Determination 4. A Settlement in the Red Bluffs 5. Orwell, Beneath the Crags 6. Battle 2 Boost Side:- 1. Battle 1 2. Battle 2 3. They Who Govern Reason 4. Battle at Journey’s End 5. Daughter of the Dark God 6.

But seriously, I’m sure that many fans of Yoshihiro Togashi’s Hunter x Hunter will be even more disappointed to hear the now-commonplace news this time around, as the current arc of the story (that the manga has been on since 2012) has really started to kick into gear. We’ve had the introduction of dozens of new nen abilities, including some of Togashi’s craziest ones yet, as well as the reappearance of fan favorites the Phantom Troupe - all with a focus on objectively the greatest character in the series, Kurapika. With that being said, the hiatus announcement in the back pages of issue number 52 (11/26) does offer some respite to fans. While the series will be going on hiatus from next week onwards, this will only be for a “little while.” It’s not like Togashi to make false promises, so I trust that he’ll back on the serialization train soon enough. In fact, he noted in his comment that he’s already done the “next 10 storyboards,” and that he only plans to take stock of his health problems before starting up again. Togashi has suffered from back problems throughout his career and even underwent surgery to alleviate some of the problems in 2014, so he has a valid excuse. Furthermore, this year is actually one of his best years yet when it comes to publication, with a 61% hiatus rate according to the terrifyingly hilarious site “Hiatus x Hiatus." Many fans have pointed out that there is a pattern to Togashi’s hiatuses, in that he tends to do ten issues and then takes a break. Whether this is intentional or not is unclear, but I’d rather have Togashi-sensei be in good health than make him push himself. Just like everyone else, I’d like to see what the Dark Continent actually is before I die, but I wouldn’t like to kill Togashi in the process.|Hunter x Hunter, hxh, Hunter x Hunter Hiatus, Shonen Jump, Weekly Shonen Jump
14789|2018-11-27|11:00||http://otaquest.com/osaka-world-expo-2025/| News | N/A | Osaka to Host World Expo in 2025 | N/A |Osaka has won the bid for the 2025 World Expo over the Russian city of Yekaterinburg and the Azerbaijan capital of Baku, which will see the event make its way back to the Kansai region 55 years after the landmark 1970 Osaka Expo. With how important the 1970 Expo was to the region, and indeed to the country as a whole, it’s no wonder that both citizens and politicians alike are celebrating. Combined with the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, this was a period where the Japanese economy was beginning to come into its own, and when the country felt sure enough to strut it’s stuff on the world stage - marking the beginning of a period of Japanese hegemony in East Asia. And given that Tokyo will be hosting the Olympics once more in 2020, it seems almost perfect to let Osaka host the World Expo as well, allowing history to repeat itself. But beyond simple historical consistency, the Japanese government is no doubt hoping that the events will have much of the same economic effects that were felt in the 1970s, as the country faces the gargantuan problems of an aging society, declining birthrate, and stagnating economy. More specifically, the current Liberal Democratic Party administration is hoping that these international events will help boost the tourist economy and therefore reinvigorate the Japanese consumer economy in general. Coincidentally, one of the key threads of the government’s policy towards the tourist economy also happens to be the incorporation and acceptance of otaku culture through the so-called ‘Cool Japan’ policy, beginning in 2010. Therefore, it’s a strong possibility that popular culture will have a role to play in the World Expo as well, although it will supposedly focus on “advanced technologies” such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence. That’s to say nothing of the Olympics, of course - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared in Rio out of a pipe and wearing Mario’s cap in 2016, after all. Regardless, the World Expo represents an important opportunity for Osaka. Governor Ichiro Matsui remarked that although the 1970 expo was a landmark, there was a shift in economic power back to Tokyo afterward, the effects of which are still being felt in Osaka today. Without a doubt, the local government sees the Expo as an opportunity to build Osaka’s economic clout from anew - which is perhaps why they are choosing to have the event on the newly created, man-made island of Yumeshima.

While the series which originally released in 1995 has been in somewhat of a global licensing hell for the past several years, it's met with equal shock and expectancy that of all the major players, Netflix would be the one to host the show globally. Not only did Netflix manage to nab the original series, however, but they also managed to get both The End of Evangelion and Evangelion: Death (True)2 in the process, which is possibly the most exciting part of the announcement. While a worldwide "Spring release" might sound a little confusing for those outside of North America, Netflix has confirmed that the anime and films will be added to their catalog in the first half of 2019. Speaking of which, Netflix really isn't holding any punches when it comes to releasing the series worldwide. They mean it, and you can bet that Neon Genesis Evangelion will be made available in your country, wherever you are. If there was ever any question about how hard Netflix is going on anime, this might just be the biggest sign yet. In recent years we've seen Hideaki Anno revisit the seminal series with his new team at Studio Khara through a series of "rebuild" films that have long been leading up to the ever-mysterious fourth entry, Shin Evangelion. There is currently no word on these rebuild films being added to Netflix's global catalog anytime soon, but one can only hope. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed about the release of Neon Genesis Evangelion and its companion films as its revealed. |Neon Genesis Evangelion, Netflix, Netflix Anime, Evangelion, Evangelion Netflix, Neon Genesis Evangelion Netflix, Hideaki Anno, Gainax

Along with being one of the most prominent events, it's also one of the longest-running, with December 22, 2018, celebrating the ninth anniversary of elemog, as well as the 99th event as a whole. With such a chance happening, there's no way that Mogra wasn't going to go all-in for this celebration. To accomplish this mission, Mogra was going to settle for nothing less than the best, announcing earlier this week that for the very first time ever Yasutaka Nakata would be performing at the Akihabara-based club. 【情報解禁】 秋葉原発ダンスミュージックパーティー「elemog」の9周年アニバーサリーパーティーが12月22日(土)に開催決定！！！ エレモグの99回目/9周年を祝うスペシャルゲストに日本を代表するエレクトロシーンの立役者『中田ヤスタカ』が秋葉原 #MOGRA 初登場！！！https://t.co/NERoxziYNY pic.twitter.com/R2GTn9irXF — MOGRA (@MOGRAstaff) 24 November 2018 I'd like to hope that anyone reading OTAQUEST is already familiar with Yasutaka Nakata, but for those who don't yet realize they already are, he's the genius behind some of Japan's biggest acts, including Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Perfume, Capsule, all on top of his solo works. His electronic sounds have gone on to define entire genres, and have even been documented as key inspirations for international legends such as Porter Robinson, Madeon, and Sophie. Joining Yasutaka Nakata throughout the night, we're set to be treated to Mogra's familiar set of resident talent who have gone on to define the sounds of elemog throughout its tremendous nine-year, ninety-nine event run. Set to take place in the side-streets of Akihabara, Tokyo, on December 22, this is likely going to be a night that you definitely won't want to miss.

The event was held at Sony Ginza Park, a shopping & art collaboration complex just off of the Ginza subway line, and the home to previous concept projects by Fujiwara. It’s being housed in the same area as his currently running “THE CONVENI” project, with a corner area dedicated to the THUNDERBOLT PROJECT popup itself. As we walked in staff warned us that a caged off area behind the stairs had been taken over by wild Pokemon. Inside the cage (which is located behind what looks to be a checkout counter for the popup but wasn’t in service during the event) there was a bunch of the black colored Pikachu plush made for the popup alongside a neon light with the iconic Fragment Design logo. Purchases during preview night were being handled outside of THE CONVENI, but this area themed for the popup had an incredibly clean look that suits the collaboration perfectly. As I got in line to check out and purchase some of the goods, the staff started looping us around the venue as the line grew to an unexpected size. I can’t really speak to the amount of stock that was made available during the preview night, but it seemed like everyone in attendance picked up at least one item. I managed to snag a couple of shirts I missed out on at HYPEFEST, along with 2 new shirts that debuted at the popup. Attendees were also given the promotional bag that was distributed at HYPEFEST while waiting in line, which was a nice bonus since I had just barely missed getting one when I was in New York for that event. The popup itself was a ticketed event for the weekend due to worries of demand outpacing supply. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the tickets alleviated those problems as the official Instagram account for the event had posted on Saturday that they were nearly out of stock and closing on Sunday for maintenance. It hasn’t been said how they’re handling those who had tickets for Sunday to enter, but earlier today it was announced that they will be opening up an online shop that will run concurrently with the popup to help with capacity & availability concerns. View this post on Instagram 【INFORMATION NOTICE】 「THUNDERBOLT PROJECT 」では、このたびGINZA限定商品以外のアイテムをオンラインにて販売することを決定いたしました。 詳細は近日中に、改めてTHUNDERBOLT PROJECTの公式Instagram、および THE CONVENI @theconveni のSNS･WEBサイトにて告知いたしますので、お待ちください。 A post shared by THUNDERBOLT PROJECT (@tb_project) on Nov 26, 2018 at 4:08am PST I’m personally not very surprised by the turnout & scenario as it exists. Items at HYPEFEST were sold out within an hour and commanding very high prices on eBay shortly thereafter. When an iconic designer meets a monolithic brand, these kinds of things are bound to happen. Pokemon fans count in the millions (as evidenced by the recent Let’s Go sales figures), so adding that to the demand commanded by FRAGMENT DESIGN’s existing audience and I don’t think anyone could truly be prepared for the hype that follows. In our interview with Fujiwara he did make mention that this collaboration will be running for a period of 2 years with many different designs planned over that period of time. That being the case, it’s pretty realistic to think that fans will be able to get their hands on at least a few items throughout the timespan. Pokemon is also a global property, so that should also play into availability a bit as time goes on. Of course, we’ll be keeping a very watchful eye on this amazing collection as it continues to unfold and we’ll be sure to report any updates as they happen!|Pokemon, Thunderbolt Project, hiroshi fujiwara, fragment design, Collaboration, Pop-Up

Over 100 concerts being held up to this point to much success, and these look set to continue long into the future, with a set of concerts featuring music from the newest title in the series, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, currently underway in Japan. In fact, the third and final date for this new set of concerts in Tokyo is set to be livestreamed on Nico Nico Douga, something we reported on quite recently. According to various attendees of the most recent concert held at Orix Theatre in Osaka, Japan, series producer Eiji Aonuma appeared on stage during the performance and asked attendees how they would feel about seeing Skyward Sword re-released on Nintendo Switch, a question that was met with much applause from the audience. This isn’t the first time that a HD re-release of this title has been teased by people at Nintendo. During a GDC talk in America in 2017 in regards to Breath of the Wild, it was noted that, in order to help decide what art style the development team would like to use for that game, various older games in the series were brought into HD, one of which was Skyward Sword. Not only that, as far back as 2013 the team noted that they had tested how the game looked in HD before deciding to remaster Wind Waker, but noted the team didn’t have the capacity to remaster this game as well. The game was controversial on its release due to the motion controls and it would be interesting to see how such criticisms were addressed with a remaster that could potentially revamp the game’s controls. At the moment, though, this potential remaster is not officially announced. However, with multiple comments made in the past and the game once again being teased at these new concerts, the idea that we could see Skyward Sword being given a second chance to shine is certainly not out of the question.

Designed by Yu Suzuki, known for many of SEGA’s best arcade games like Hang-On and Space Harrier as well as being the director of the well-loved Shenmue series, this high-paced driving game is still fondly remembered for its gameplay and music over 30 years later. In recent months SEGA has been re-releasing some of their back catalog of games onto the Nintendo Switch in an enhanced package under the SEGA AGES label, with previous releases so far including Phantasy Star, Sonic the Hedgehog and Thunder Force IV. Having been announced last week that OutRun was set to join this series of re-releases, SEGA has now confirmed via Twitter that the game will be released in Japan before the end of the month. This special re-release, however, will not simply be an emulated copy of the original arcade game or any previous home console release. This version of OutRun will receive a few improvements for this release, such as the addition of optional gyro controls, widescreen 60fps support and the inclusion of new music created from 3D OutRun, an enhanced version of the game that was released on Nintendo 3DS. For a chance to experience this title, it will be available in Japan on November 29th for 925yen, with a release worldwide scheduled for early 2019.

The game is being developed by APLUS and will be published by Arc System Works. During the event, it was announced Harime Nui and Ragyou Kiryuuin will each return from the anime and feature in the game as playable characters. We also received the first screenshots that showcase these characters in battle. Harime Nui, for those who are unaware, is one of the main antagonists of the show and is the Grand Couturier of the Revocs Corporation. She is characterized by her childlike demeanor and feminine appearance of a pink lolita outfit. Ragyou Kiryuuin, on the other hand, is the primary antagonist of the anime, Revocs Corporation CEO and the mother of Satsuki Kiryuuin. Although both of these characters are playable, joining the previously announced slate of fighters that include Nonon Jakuzure and Ryuko Matoi, it is not known what their role will be in this title’s story at this time. Perhaps most excitingly for fans of the Nintendo's massively-popular hybrid console, however, is the announcement that this title will now also be arriving simultaneously on Nintendo Switch, alongside its originally planned PlayStation 4 and PC versions. Each of these versions are set to arrive in 2019, with the game having already been announced for a worldwide release.

Released earlier this week via Ryan Hemsworth's own "Secret Songs" label, Tomggg is found teaming up with New Jersey-born R&B/Electronic vocalist Ehiorobo, leaving us with one of Tomggg's most embracing releases to date, "Feel Ya". If you've ever had the opportunity to see Tomggg perform, you'd undoubtedly know his affinity for the R&B sounds that compose a major part of his sets. With a solid appreciation for the format, a collaboration with Ehiorobo comes as a natural fit, layering Tomggg's signature hyper-cute pop sound underneath Ehiorobo's incredibly diverse vocal range. The end result is one of Tomggg's most impactful songs to date, and definitely the sort of song that won't be getting out of my head anytime soon.

The league will be split into an East Japan and West Japan league, with priority entry being given to players which placed in the top two during Smash tournaments held at the Nintendo Live event in Tokyo as well as this weekend’s event in Kyoto. Details of the exact structure of this league alongside prizes for competing players are currently unknown, although Nintendo have said that such information will be released on their website in the near future. The league will begin in January 2019 and promises to bring the top Smash Bros players in Japan together to compete at the highest levels of the game, making it an exciting prospect for fans and players alike.|Super Smash Bros.

14770|2018-11-24|14:00||http://otaquest.com/anime-business-magazine-international/| News | Anime | Anime Business Magazine Releases Special English Edition about the International Anime Market | Anime Buscience, a magazine focused on the business of anime, has released a new edition in English highlight the international market outside of Japan. |Anime Buscience (a very clever combination of “Business” and “Science”) is a Japanese magazine that releases fairly irregularly with information about the anime industry. However, instead of talking about animation, voice acting or script writing, Anime Buscience talks about marketing, cash flow and business trends. The magazine is run by the anime production megacorp GENCO and unless you’re excited to learn more about the side of the industry that can afford to buy suits, it can be a very boring read. However, I am unashamedly one of those people. So thankfully for me, they recently released part of their April 2018 edition in English to be given out at the American Film Market that ran from 31 October-7 November in Santa Monica. OTAQUEST staff wasn’t hitting the beach that week, but as a consolation, they’ve released the articles online. The three topics covered are: “A Multi-Genre Study on the Scale of the Industry” This article by Tetsuya Watanabe analyses last year’s “2017 Anime Industry Report” to determine what sort of value the overseas market has on the anime industry. It mentions that whilst kids series like Pokemon used to be the way Japanese animation could branch out overseas, nowadays it’s possible to find overseas audiences with a wider variety of genres. One example they bring up is Yuri on Ice!! which had over 10 million views on Crunchyroll and over 600 million views on Chinese streaming service Youku Tudou. Watanabe refers to the rise of digital distribution to be the main factor in how anime is monetized overseas. Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Netflix are acknowledged as major players in the US market, whilst Youku Tudou, BiliBili and iQIYI are acknowledged as popular services in China. He mentions that these digital licenses are important for China as the government has been censoring content and blocking broadcast licenses. The article concludes with three recommendations for companies when expanding their anime overseas. The first recommendation is to make the role of production companies within the committee clear so that licensing and rights management can be done smoothly all under one roof. The second recommendation is to value the user data which becomes available from digital streaming and to use it to determine future licensing decisions. And the third recommendation is to recruit staff from overseas who can offer new perspectives. “Is Japan Going to become China’s “Anime-Making Factory?”” The next two articles were written by the President of Dentsu (an international advertising agency) Consulting Yuji Mori. This article refers to IP management and warns that Chinese investment in anime could end up with studios and Japanese production companies being cut out of sales and licensing revenue. Mori’s focus is on how Japanese companies can maximize their investment in anime and even though both China and Netflix pay huge numbers for anime, he’s worried that China will begin treating Japan as a factory for their own properties and that Netflix restricts options for further monetization when a series is popular (i.e. overseas TV broadcasts). “The Japanese Anime Industry (An Overview)” The final article is a summary of how anime is monetized and discusses modern marketing strategies. Beginning with Astro Boy, Mori takes the reader through the changes in anime funding and IP management, specifically referring to the unique production committee system within the industry. This system is still changing due to the participation of games and overseas licensors within funding series from the ground-up. One of the most interesting parts of the article is a table that regards all the activities surrounding anime and whether they provide income for the producers and whether they are manageable or not. According to Mori, cosplay, voice actor events and pirated works, although unmanageable and unlicensed, still have some value in that they can shape how an anime is perceived and thus increase income. One fan activity that Mori doesn’t see much potential in is pilgrimages (where fans take trips to anime locations), which he finds doesn’t provide profits to tourism areas, but instead just has an economic effect on the transportation services that let fans get to those areas. The article concludes with Mori hoping that anime will continue to be enjoyed worldwide and also hoping that the anime industry can keep foreign investors at arm’s length. This article has just been a basic summary of some of the interesting points brought up within the magazine. It’s worth mentioning that these perspectives come from business and advertising professionals within anime production, not the anime creators themselves, so there’s a lot of points they skip over, such as working conditions and low starting wages for animators. But if you want to take a look at the full business-y perspective, the full articles are available on their website.

From the incredible Hayao Miyazaki-directed first season to the latest Yuichiro Yano-directed fifth season, the now forty-seven-year-old anime franchise constantly outdoes itself with the aforementioned fifth season being one of the franchises all-time highest points. Now with the franchise shifting its attention away from the now-completed fifth season and towards the future, TMS Entertainment today revealed their next project. Detailed via Lupin the Third's official website, the posting shares that the series will be receiving its twenty-sixth television special during Winter 2019 featuring a special "Black Jacket" Lupin. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, each jacket color represents a different stage of Lupin's life, with the anime franchise kicking off with the original "Green Jacket" Lupin, and the most recent installments utilizing a "Blue Jacket" Lupin. While the reasoning behind the new "Black Jacket" Lupin is unknown, it does create an interesting premise that's definitely got me itching to check it out. While Lupin the Third: Part 5 director Yuichiro Yano won't be helming the project, with Jun Kawagoe instead taking on the first appearance of "Black Jacket" Lupin, it'll be interesting to see just what direction he hopes to take the special. As usual, we'll be seeing the legendary Yuji Ohno returning to handle the anime's music, so we can already count on that being completely perfect. Set to air in Winter 2019, I can't wait to finally check out the twenty-sixth television special for Lupin the Third. Though it's in Japanese, those interested in checking out further details on the upcoming special can check out Lupin the Third's official website.|Lupin the Third, Lupin, Lupin III, Lupin the 3rd, Black Jacket, Lupin Black Jacket, TMS Entertainment, Monkey Punch

Up until now the go-to remix for this was Assertive's incredible hardcore bootleg from back in July, but now Kizuna AI's come back with an official remix of her own, this time calling on none-other than three-person electronic unit Pa's Lam System to add their signature frantic spin to the track. Already having taken the crown as kings of the Tokyo club scene, there's no doubt in my mind that Pa's Lam System's frantic new remix of "Hello, Morning" will be taking over just about every event before you know it. Between the bouncy rhythm provided by the trio and Kizuna AI's infectious hooks, there's definitely a whole lot to enjoy on this one, though I do wish Pa's Lam System could have gone ahead and done an entirely original track instead of a remix. Marking the fifth of eight releases from Kizuna AI before her massive "Hello World" live shows in both Tokyo and Osaka, it's been an incredible past few weeks for fans of Japan's burgeoning electronic scene, as well as fans of Virtual YouTuber's as a whole. With tracks produced by Taku Takahashi, De De Mouse, and sasakure.UK still to be released, there's absolutely a whole lot more to look forward to. Until then, be sure to keep up to date with our full archive of Kizuna AI-related coverage, here. |Kizuna Ai, Hello, Morning, Pa's Lam System, NOR
14767|2018-11-23|13:00||http://otaquest.com/nis-destiny-connect-trailer/| News | N/A | NIS Releases First Trailer for New RPG 'Destiny Connect' | N/A |Yesterday, Nippon Ichi Software (NIS) unveiled the debut trailer, as well as a boatload of information, for their brand new RPG set for release on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on February 28, 2019, titled Destiny Connect. The game revolves around the 10-year-old ‘Sherry’ and is set in the fictional city of ‘Clockney’. The story takes place on New Year’s Eve 1999, the day before the world is set to usher in the new millennium. Every year, to welcome the new year, the city holds the ‘Soul Man Festival’ which hosts a massive fireworks display as the countdown to new year reaches zero. However, when the fireworks begin, time in the city stops. Both the fireworks and the people who live in the city come to a halt, with the city now frozen in time. The reason for the city being stuck in time is related to the machines that now wander this static city, and you must travel to the past and the future in order to fix the issues that face Clockney and restart time itself. The game is a turn-based RPG, with a variety of customization mechanics that allow both human and robot companions to gain new abilities over the course of the game. Time travel will also be a key component in uncovering the mysteries of Clockney. While a Western release of this game has yet to be announced, the fact that it is being developed internally by Nippon Ichi Software makes us hopeful that it will see a release in some form.

14766|2018-11-23|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/fate-stay-night-racing/| News | Anime , Games | ‘Fate/stay night’ Teams Up With the Japanese Racing Association | N/A |If there’s one thing that the Fate series loves even more than swords, it would have to be horses - after all, it has an entire Servant class dedicated to heroes who rodes things (mainly horses). And with the latest Heaven’s Feel movies focusing on Servant Rider and her master, perhaps it makes sense that the franchise would team up with none other than the Japanese Racing Association (JRA), who organize horse races across the entire country. The JRA unveiled their new collaboration website with the Fate series, called ‘SERVANT/KEIBA’ (literally ‘Servant/Horse Racing’), yesterday. The website forms part of the series’ advertising campaign for the upcoming release of the second part of the Heaven’s Feel film trilogy, Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II. Lost Butterfly, and beyond the absolutely killer key visual of various characters from the series enjoying riding horses, there’s lots of fun stuff for fans of the series to get their hands on. First up is the return of the highly popular Run! Run! Lancer game that launched last year to promote the release of the first Heaven’s Feel movie, this time featuring Rider chasing True Assassin instead of Lancer. Not much has changed beyond the fact that it features Rider, well, riding a horse, but the game proved very popular with fans last year due to its addictive gameplay and excellent graphics by developers Ladybug. Next up is a more original project called Escape from Racecourse which involves the player solving a mystery alongside characters from the series to, well, escape from a racecourse. Players who manage to complete the game will receive a special phone background, as well as the opportunity to enter into a competition to win some prize money, provided that you follow the JRA’s official Twitter account. This prize money is also available to those who clear Run! Run! Rider - but that’s a much more difficult to accomplish. Furthermore, at the JRA’s home of Nakayama Racecourse in Chiba, there will be a special booth operating as a “photo spot” for fans to celebrate the collaboration campaign. Plus, the first 1000 people who make it to Nakayama will receive a special lanyard themed after the collaboration starting on December 9 - so it’s worth making the trip if you’re a fan. Horse racing is a pretty big past-time in Japan - or rather, betting on horse races is - so Fate teaming up with the JRA is a pretty big deal. Not that they particularly need the publicity though, as I’m sure that fans of the series will be turning out in droves to see the next installment in the Heaven’s Feel trilogy anyway. You can check out all of the things outlined above via the official collaboration website. Happy riding!|Fate/Stay Night, Fate, Stay Night, Japanese Racing Association

14764|2018-11-22|16:00||http://otaquest.com/pokemon-lets-go-opening-week/| News | Games | Pokémon: Let’s Go! Takes the Best-Performing Opening Week on Nintendo Switch | N/A |While both Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Let’s Go, Eevee! may have had some choice criticisms from the more dedicated Pokémon fans prior to the game’s launch, due in no small part to some of the planned changes to the series formula, it'd turn out that such criticisms have done very little to harm the game in terms of sales. The game has proven to be a massive hit since it launched on November 16, with The Pokémon Company tweeting that opening week sales have reached 3 million copies. While the massive popularity of the Pokémon series means that such a record-breaking debut should come as no surprise, this debut performance places the game’s launch week ahead of titles such as Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which might come as a surprise to a few. Alongside that news, with Nintendo having recently confirmed that lifetime sales for Super Mario Odyssey have reached 12 million as of September 30, the title is already 25% of the way towards overtaking it as the most popular game on the system. It’s likely that the success of the games is understated here too. It's not unlikely that many players also decided to pick up the Pokéball Plus accessory that launched alongside the game, which can be used both to play Pokémon: Let’s Go! on the Nintendo Switch, as well as connecting to your phone to be used with Pokémon GO. Not only that, however, but every Pokéball Plus also includes Mew, a legendary Pokémon which is otherwise not accessible in-game through alternative means. In any case, however you look at these numbers, it’s clear that the changes made by Game Freak for this release have been a success. With 3 million sales already and a special console bundle available in all territories, Pokémon will certainly help to boost the Switch’s hardware sales as the holiday season approaches.|Pokemon

I never had the chance to play the game when it originally released on PS2 in 2004 (alas, it was never available in Europe), but I was able to give it a go many years later, and it made me fall in love with both the game and the series in general. It had a lot of charm, carefully combining its unique concept and a wonderful soundtrack. That’s why the news that this title would be re-released on Nintendo Switch and on Steam was really exciting for me. With the launch date for the game coming ever-closer, Bandai Namco has released a demo for this remastered version on the Nintendo eShop earlier today in Japan. The size of the demo comes in just short of 1GB and gives players access to the first level of the game. The full version will be playable using either traditional controls or a new gyro-based control system which sees players rotate the Joy Con controllers in order to roll around the stage. The game will also see the return of the original title’s multiplayer mode with the ability for each player to use a single Joy Con to control the action. The demo won’t be available outside of Japan until the game releases on December 7th, although you can connect to the Japanese eShop if you’re desperate to give the game a go before then. Meanwhile, the game releases in Japan 2 weeks later than it does in the West, with a release date penciled in for December 20th. Katamari Damacy Reroll will be available digitally worldwide, with a physical version available in Japan and the US.|Katamari Damacy Reroll, Katamari Damacy, Nintendo Switch, Switch, Katamari Damacy Reroll Demo, Katamari Damacy Demo
14762|2018-11-22|14:00||http://otaquest.com/reincarnated-as-slime-engineering-mag/| News | Anime , Manga | ‘That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime’ Features in Civil Engineering Magazine | N/A |There are lots of things we can learn from anime, and not just moral and philosophical lessons - perhaps there are a few nuggets of knowledge nestled in the medium when it comes to something like civil engineering. At least, that's what “Civil Engineering Monthly” seems to think so. Civil engineering is a discipline that focuses on the construction and planning of man-made structures and is often useful in city planning and the construction of large projects, such as bridges and roads. Considering how limited liveable space in Japan is, it’s a discipline that’s highly useful for the development of the Japanese urban center. In the meantime, the magazine “Civil Engineering Monthly” focuses on the various civil engineering projects going on around Japan as well as future projects being planned for future implementation. It has a readership of both professionals and casual hobbyists alike, so for the magazine’s December issue to focus entirely on the special theme of “civil engineering and anime” is nothing to be sniffed at. And what better series to lead the issue with than That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime? After all, the series focuses a fair bit on the protagonist’ efforts to sustain their newfound monster kingdom - which includes a fair bit of civil engineering - and the fact that an anime adaptation is currently airing should draw a bit more attention than usual to the magazine. The story focusing on the series will feature an interview with the original light novels’ author Fuse, where he and the magazine discuss his series from a civil engineering viewpoint. The issue is also including a signed card from the author as a special gift to all those who purchase it. December’s issue also features a wide range of articles on other anime beyond That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. These include Astro Boy’s “vision of a future Tokyo”, the road signs of Bakemonogatari, Shinbashi station in Patlabor, and the Tashubetsu bridge (Hokkaido) in Girls und Panzer. Most of the articles focus on the representation of various man-made structures in anime, and how they can help civil engineers today to create more efficient designs and systems. If that sounds like something that you’d be interested in, then definitely considering picking up this strange yet fascinating issue of the magazine. It goes on sale November 28.|That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime, Civil Engineering Magazine
14761|2018-11-22|13:00||http://otaquest.com/sword-art-online-arcade-design/| News | Games | ‘Sword Art Online Arcade’ Unveils Cabinet Designs, Gameplay Ahead of Location Test | N/A |With the anime adaptation of the “Alicization” arc of Reki Kawahara’s Sword Art Online series in full swing, don’t forget that there’s even more Kirito goodness set to come our way - not least of which the newly announced arcade game, which has just dropped a mass of information ahead of its location tests in December. First up, we have more details on the gameplay of the series’ first arcade title. We already knew that the game would be a dungeon crawler and that it would support up to three players online, but I did wonder what control scheme the game would use, as other top-down action arcade titles such as Wonderland Wars have opted for a touchscreen control scheme in the past. But instead of any of these options, SAO Arcade has opted for a more orthodox setup of a joystick and three buttons, which is perhaps best for the frantic action that it no doubt hopes to deploy. Though the game will utilize the more orthodox controls, the touchscreen will be used to activate sword skills - the special moves from the original in-universe Sword Art Online VRMMO - which I’m not exactly happy with. You’ll have to take your hands off the actual controls to activate them, which will no doubt be annoying in the middle of an intense skirmish - in fact, Kantai Collection Arcade has a similar system with moving your fleet into a different formation, and it has lead to failure more than a few times. Even so, I’m really happy with the design of the arcade machines themselves. There will in fact be two machines required for the game, the actual unit for playing and a “terminal” where players can manage their inventory and print out cards. The usage of a separate terminal for inventory-related maintenance should free up the machines for people who actually want to play, which should no doubt speed up the turnover of players - something which Kantai Collection Arcade also sometimes suffers from. The machines have an in-game significance as well, as according to the story of the game they are full-dive machines called “ViSTer,” using which the player can visit the VRMMO world of “Unknown” and play alongside well-known SAO characters. As you’d expect, you’ll be able to collect these characters as cards to form your squad, which means that you don’t have to play with Kirito if you really don’t want to. I wouldn’t blame you if you do, either. The game will release Spring 2019 and is also expected to be launching a companion app alongside the arcade machines that will allow you to customize your squad and inventory even when you’re not at the game center. Because why would you ever want to leave the side of your Sword Art Online comrades?|Sword Art Online, Sword Art Online Arcade, SAO, SAO Arcade

While those in Japan have been able to enjoy a short demo for quite some time now, SEGA decided that wasn't actually enough, and today dropped an all-new demo for Japanese PlayStation Plus subscribers that allows players to enjoy the entire first chapter of the game ahead of release. Coming from SEGA's in-house Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, the same team behind the legendary Yakuza series of games, there's no doubting the hype behind this release. Much like the demos made available for entries into the aforementioned Yakuza series, the latest demo offers players the freedom of roaming around and enjoying the entirety of the game's first chapter, with progress transferring across to the full game upon release. Currently available exclusively for PlayStation Plus subscribers in Japan, non-subscribers will be able to get their hands on the demo a full week later when it goes public on November 29, 2018. This should give PlayStation 4 owners more than enough time to enjoy the game's first chapter before the real deal comes out in Japan on December 13, just two weeks later. Easily one of my most anticipated games, we're left eagerly awaiting further news on the announced yet not detailed English-language release of the game. Until then, however, you can check out even more on SEGA's upcoming Judge Eyes via the game's official website.|Judge Eyes, Sega, Nagoshi, Project Judge, Judge Eyes Demo

For one, we're seeing some pretty cool collaborations come to light as a result of this, one of which is the most recently announced "Eevee x Tamagotchi" collaboration device, which sees Eevee find a home on a Tamagotchi device modeled after some of the earlier units. Set to be released in Japan on January 26, 2019, the device is going to set you back a surprisingly low amount, coming in at a cool 2,300 yen. Offered in two different models, the "I love Eevee" version, as well as the "Colorful Friends" version, it's actually proving surprisingly difficult to choose between the two, especially with the accenting on the "Colorful Friends" version proving especially appealing. Apart from the differing shells, however, both models share the same functionality. The devices will function similar to original iterations of Tamagotchi, in which owners are required to take care of these precious friends like they were a real pet. Through positive caretaking, the pets will eventually evolve -- or in this case, the Eevee will become one of its eight different Eeveelutions. Oh, and there's also going to be an additional ninth Eeveelution being introduced for the first time via the Tamagotchi collaboration, so there's that to be excited about too. While I'm not sure how willing I am to become a full-time caretaker for another creature, chances are I'll probably act on impulse and pick up one of the Eevee Tamagotchi anyway. Though with that being said, we'll probably be finding out pretty quick if the Eevee can die just like in the original devices if I do get one. Those interested in checking out further information on the Eevee Tamagotchi devices can head over to the official website.|Pokemon, Tamagotchi, Eevee, Eevee Tamagotchi

The game is set for release in 2019 and the debut trailer gives eager fans a first look into what to expect from this new entry. Although the series has rarely seen release outside of Japan, the games remain quite popular in their home country. The series has been released on various systems and on mobile since its 1991 debut, with this new game receiving a Nintendo home console release for the first time since Super Robot Wars NEO in 2009 on the Nintendo Wii. One of the defining features of the series is the collaborative nature of these titles, with characters and mechs from a variety of popular mecha properties included in many of these games. This new title is no different, with confirmed mecha series including returning properties like Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Gundam ZZ, Gunbuster, and Martian Successor Nadesico, alongside series debuts for shows like Expelled from Paradise and Cowboy Bebop. While the game is not currently scheduled for a Western release, it has been announced that the game will receive an English-subtitled version in Asia next year, which at the very least should make the title more accessible for a wider group of people. With the game set to launch release next year in 2019, you can find even more details on the upcoming Super Robot Wars T via the game's official website.|Super Robot Wars T, Super Robot Wars, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Switch, PS4

Ultimate next month -- you can include me on that list as well. This massive collaborative party fighting game looks to be going above and beyond previous entries in the series due to the sheer number of characters, stages, and features included, so it’s no wonder people are looking forward to it. Amazon Japan is taking a moment of their own to capitalize on this excitement with a special (and very limited) bundle of all the Smash series amiibo released in the past, alongside some of the amiibo for the newcomers to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, housed within a branded box and including a bundled wall scroll. Many of the amiibo included in this set are quite difficult to find now, with them long since being out of print following the release of the Wii U and 3DS version of Super Smash Bros. The fact that this set could now allow you to collect every single amiibo, including those more expensive ones, in one single purchase could prove to be a very tempting proposition for people. That's only if they’re one of the lucky people who can get a hold of it, however. This Amazon-exclusive set will go on sale on December 7th at 6:00 pm (UTC+9) and is limited to just 50 units. Considering the collectability of amiibo, the hype surrounding this new Smash title, and the very limited availability for this set, you’ll have to act fast to have a chance of claiming it. While the actual price for this set is currently unknown, my personal speculation would suggest it would cost somewhere close to the combined price of each amiibo individually, making it quite a pricey endeavor for anyone interested. With that being said, if you have big pockets and a desire to own this set for yourself, you can find out more at the Amazon page for this deal here.|Amiibo, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Smash Bros, Smash Bros Amiibo

While the event is technically the anniversary celebrations for Louge Neo, you'll be hard-pressed sticking to any given location, where I usually find myself hitting up every venue based on the timetable provided and the artists I actually want to see. With over 70 acts performing throughout the day, there's definitely going to be a number of familiar and unfamiliar sounds that you'll be exposed to. So whether you're going ham to the hyperactive sounds of PA'S LAM SYSTEM, moshing to the sounds of Haka Gang vs. Nerd Dope Crew's performance, or losing yourself in the moment to Chelmico's live performance, there's undoubtedly going to be a number of highlights to your day.

One of such groups is Maison Book Girl, one of the numerous BiS off-shoots that make up my list, and possibly one of the most interesting. Today is an especially good day to talk about the group, with today marking the release of their third (and largest) studio album to date, "Yume". We've covered a fair number of the tracks included in this album's massive twenty-one song tracklist, but even then we're hardly scratching the surface of "Yume". It's a beautifully elaborate album filled with gentle interludes that strike just enough tension to keep you on your toes, while simultaneously keeping you relaxed between the more intense moments of the album. While each of the singles released prior to this stand entirely on their own, it's in this complete package that they truly shine. The album's twenty-one song tracklist can be seen below: 1. fMRI_TEST#2 2. 言選り_ 3. SIX 4. 狭い物語 5. MOVE 6. ボーイミーツガール 7. PAST 8. rooms_ 9. MORE PAST 10. 十六歳_ 11.

This will be the first time in 24 years that PlayStation will not be in attendance for the biggest annual video game convention in the world. It also comes hot on the heels of the announcement that they will not be having the PlayStation Experience (PSX) in 2018, which is usually held in December. This is especially interesting because E3 and PlayStation have such an intertwined history. Some can reason that E3 plays a big part in the successes that PlayStation has had in the past. In 1995, it was at E3 that PlayStation introduced its first console, a major driving force in so many of my childhood memories, the original PlayStation. Moreover, diving past the PlayStation 2 and 3, it was also at E3 in 2013 that Playstation first got the ball rolling for their uber-successful Playstation 4 that recently turned five years old. The reason as to why they are not attending is rumored to be that they are looking to take a page out of Nintendo’s book and work more on their online front instead of their convention presence, which does not always have the best reception. Another reason to justify their withdrawal is that PlayStation may simply not have enough content to show the fans at the moment with only a couple of big games, Dreams and Days Gone, releasing in 2019. Lastly, there are some whispers that they are gearing up to announce that a new system is on the horizon. Nevertheless, this gives others more of a stage to show off their upcoming games and push their systems to the forefront of gamers’ minds. I’m sure we will all get to see some cool announcements and demos from both companies!

14743|2018-11-21|12:00||http://otaquest.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-together-trailer/| News | Games | New Action-Packed Kingdom Hearts III Trailer Surfaces Online | N/A |As excitement continues to build around the long-awaited Kingdom Hearts 3, set to release on January 29, 2019, we’ve begun to see a steady uptick in new trailers teasing what’s in store for players when they finally get a hold of this title in the new year. Today is no different, as another trailer has been released by Square Enix showcasing more new content from the game. This trailer is rather different in tone to those that came before it, adopting the tone of a Hollywood blockbuster trailer instead of the Hikaru Utada-backed dialogue-heavy teasers that have come before. In turn, the content of this trailer is rather different too, as this time the story takes a back seat in place of a massive showcase of some of the set-piece boss battles players can come to expect once the game launches. The trailer starts by introducing some of the massive bosses Sora will have to face in the new Big Hero 6 world as well as in the returning Olympus Colosseum level, before quickly cycling through elements from a variety of the worlds the player will be able to visit that were already previously revealed, including Tangled, Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean and Frozen. One thing that continues to impress throughout this trailer is the level of detail on display as it comes eerily close to emulating the movies they’re based upon, with scenes such as the lantern festival from Tangled rendered in impressive detail. With Tetsuya Nomura already having stated that the number of trailers would increase as we got closer and closer to launch, expect to see more snippets of the game before this title releases at the end of January. Especially with the announcement that the game has now gone gold.|Kingdom Hearts III, Kingdom Hearts, Together Trailer, Square Enix
14739|2018-11-20|19:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/studio-xebec-sunrise-transfer/| News | Anime | Studio Xebec's Anime Productions Will Be Transferred to Sunrise | N/A |If you are keen on knowing which anime studios produce the animation for which shows, then you probably immediately recognize Studio Xebec as the house behind such anime as BanG Dream, Martian Successor Nadesico, Space Battleship Yamato 2199, and many entries in the To Love-Ru series. What you may not have known is that Xebec is actually a subsidiary operating under the larger umbrella of the IG Port company, which is the parent of two other studios Production I.G and Wit Studio. While Wit has been seeing a pretty penny with the recent successes of titles like Attack on Titan and Kabenari of the Iron Fortress, Production I.G and Xebec have both seen a loss of profit. In order to mitigate and consolidate, IG Port has come to an agreement with the separately-operated Studio Sunrise to take in all of Xebec’s current work. In a press release delivered by IG Port, the company details its plans to deliver Xebec’s projects to a newly-established subsidiary at Sunrise; basically, a new team is being formed to take in the sudden influx of work. The timeline of the transition is as follows: tomorrow, on November 21, the three companies in question will sign a letter of intent. On March 1, Sunrise will establish the new subsidiary, and on March 11 the companies plan to sign the final agreement. Finally, on the first day of the Japanese fiscal year April 1, operations will be formally transferred. This all comes in spite of recent efforts by Xebec to remain profitable -- they tried working on long series to guarantee a sort of income stream, and they even moved their headquarters building. There is really no telling what this means for the future of Xebec as an anime production house. After all, the current news doesn’t state that Xebec will explicitly be shutting down, so it could all just be a temporary measure until IG Port figures out exactly what to do with the company. I do hope that all the staff at Xebec caught in between this transfer can make it out in the end. If Sunrise can accommodate them, I think that would be just beautiful.|Studio Xebec, Xebec, Sunrise, Space Battleship Yamato 2199, Bang Dream
14738|2018-11-20|18:00||http://otaquest.com/dr-stone-anime-announcement/| News | Anime , Manga | ‘Dr. STONE’ is Getting an Anime Adaptation in July 2019 | N/A |The power of science prevails! It’s been about a year since Riichiro Inagaki and Boichi’s Dr. STONE series launched in Weekly Shonen Jump, and it’s quickly become one of my favorite series in the magazine. With that, I’m very happy to announce that it will finally be getting an anime adaptation - to premiere next year, nonetheless. The anime adaptation was confirmed in this week’s issue of Weekly Shonen Jump (no. 51), after it was said that the series was going to get an “important announcement” last week. Of course, to celebrate the anime Senku and friends are on the cover for once with yet another fantastic piece of color artwork from Boichi. Check it out below: Although the studio behind the adaptation has yet to be shared - I’m holding out for MADHOUSE - the voice of the protagonist Senku has already been confirmed. Taking this central role will be none other than Yusuke Kobayashi, most famous for his recent role as Natsuki Subaru in Re:Zero, who seems pretty stoked about the part from his comment shared on the official website, which contains a lot of Senku’s pet phrases. The anime is set to begin airing July 2019, not long after The Promised Neverland’s anime adaptation, so this summer is setting up to be a real Jump blowout. It’s safe to expect to expect more information during this year’s JUMP FESTA, the annual celebration of Weekly Shonen Jump properties, the schedule of which is set to include an event featuring author Inagaki and Senku’s voice actor Kobayashi. Of course, the biggest question facing the adaptation from fans will be how it will adapt the first part of the series. The first arc of the series and it focuses on Taiju was almost completely scrapped when the series enters it’s second arc and has been much better for it. It’s not like the first arc is bad, but a good adaptation should definitely considering trimming the fat of this arc to make way for the good stuff - especially if the series is only going to air for one cour. In the meantime, keep your eye peeled on the official website and Twitter account for more information.|Dr. Stone, Dr Stone, Shonen Jump, Dr. STONE Anime
14737|2018-11-20|17:00||http://otaquest.com/netflix-devil-may-cry-series/| News | Anime , Games | Netflix ‘Castlevania’ Producer to Helm ‘Devil May Cry’ Series in Shared Universe | N/A |You might have only just finished marathoning the latest season of Netflix’s Castlevania animated series, but executive producer Adi Shankar is back at it again with another animated video game adaptation - this time tackling Capcom’s beloved hack-and-slash series, Devil May Cry. The project was announced in an interview with IGN, where Shankar declared that he had obtained the rights to the series himself so that the “jabronis” in Hollywood couldn’t mess it up before he got to it - something that I’m sure many fans of the series will be thankful for. After all, video game adaptations haven’t exactly had the best track record over the years. Still, even though Shankar now has the rights to the series, the project is in limbo as he finds both a studio to produce the show and a licensor to provide funding. Shankar’s involvement in Castlevania has been that of an executive producer, simply facilitating the production of the show and not actually working on the show itself -- instead handing it over to director Samuel Deats at Powerhouse Animation Studios. But if the success of Castlevania has proven anything, it’s that these adaptations are both viable and desirable, so I doubt that Shankar will struggle to get the project off the ground. However, even more exciting is the news that both the Castlevania and Devil May Cry series will apparently take place in the same universe, in what Shankar refers to as the “bootleg universe.” How these two series will interact with each other has lead to a lot of speculation - could we be looking at a full-scale crossover at some point? Or will there simply be nods to in-universe concepts and items? I’m also not sure that Konami and Capcom would agree to Shankar combining their two series, nor that Netflix would be keen to produce a show that makes references to something not available on their platform. Furthermore, Shankar’s announcement that he will be producing a Devil May Cry series seems to rule out the numerous other projects that he was rumored to be behind -- most notably a Legend of Zelda series -- but it does make sense that Capcom would be willing to give the rights to their series to Shankar. After all, they recently announced the latest installment in the series in Devil May Cry 5, which promises to return to the series’ roots and away from the detested DmC: Devil May Cry reboot series. An animated series would certainly give them a fair bit of second-hand advertising, as well as please the fans. Regardless, Shankar’s involvement in video game adaptations will not go unnoticed by the rest of the industry - I’m especially looking at Universal, to whom Jordan Vogt-Roberts has been continually pitching his Metal Gear Solid movie. Could this spell a new frontier?|Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry Anime, Netflix, Devil May Cry Netflix, Adi Shankar
14736|2018-11-20|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/pokemon-the-movie-power-of-us/| News | Anime | 'Pokémon the Movie: The Power of Us' Receives English Trailer | N/A |While it's been quite a while since I last wrote about the 21st entry into the Pokémon theatrical universe, this past weekend saw the release of an all-new English trailer for the upcoming film, officially titled "Pokémon the Movie: The Power of Us". Set to release in North American theaters on select days between November 24 and December 1, the film will be screened with an original English-language dub. Ahead of that screening date, The Pokémon Company has begun streaming the film's latest trailer, as seen below: Set in the fictitious locale of Frau City, the latest film sees Ash Ketchum encounter a diverse lineup of characters who he'll need to work closely alongside to save the city from certain destruction. Throughout the film, we'll be seeing the return of fan-favorite Pokémon Lugia, as well as the Ultra Sun & Moon original legendary, Zeraora. The film is described in full below: Pokémon the Movie: The Power of Us tells the story of Ash and Pikachu as they journey to a small seaside town filled with a diverse set of characters, including a young athlete, a compulsive liar, a shy researcher, a bitter old woman, and a little girl with a big secret. Every year, the townspeople gather to celebrate the Legendary Pokémon Lugia, who brings the wind that saved the town from destruction many years ago. The festival is a time for celebration, with a Pokémon Catching Race and a ceremonial flame burning brightly to summon Lugia. But when a series of incidents threatens not just the festival, but all the people and Pokémon who call the town home, it's going to take more than just Ash and Pikachu to save the day. Will these people be able to put aside their differences and work together to rescue their town? Or will it all end in destruction? The last time I wrote about the 21st installment into the Pokémon film franchise, I was reporting on it under the name Pokémon the Movie: Everyone's Story. It's been quite a while since then though, with the film originally screening in theaters across Japan back in July 2018. The film made quite a splash out here, opening at #2 in the domestic box office and spawning numerous tie-in events across the country. Set to release in theaters across North America between November 24 and December 1, you can check out even more information on screening location and story via the film's official website.|Pokemon
14735|2018-11-20|15:00||http://otaquest.com/dead-or-alive-xtreme-ps4-switch-announce/| News | Games | New Dead or Alive Xtreme Title Announced for PlayStation 4 & Nintendo Switch | N/A |The long-running Dead or Alive franchise has seen a myriad of titles on a variety of platforms since the original game was released all the way back in 1996, and this weekend saw the announcement of the latest spinoff title in the ‘Dead or Alive Xtreme’ sub-series, Xtreme 3 Scarlet. This will be an enhanced version of the original versions of this game, subtitled Fortune and Venus Vacation and released in 2016 for the PS4 and PS Vita respectively. This new version of Xtreme 3 will bring new characters, including Misaki from the PC version of the game, Venus Vacation, alongside others who are yet-to-be-announced, adjustments to the various game modes and a special ‘Soft 4D’ feature exclusively for Nintendo Switch. This ‘Soft 4D’ feature will enhance the Soft Engine (a feature of the series that defines the skin and, errr, the way the breasts move) using HD Rumble. The game will be released on both Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. This spinoff series has had its fair share of controversy over the years due to its sexualized nature, with the game diverging from its fighting game roots to engage in a fanservice-laden volleyball game involving the female characters of the series in a variety of revealing swimsuits. Yet in spite of this, it can’t be denied that these games are popular with the hardcore fans of the series who’ll be excited to pick this up. Which version they will buy, however, may be a more difficult decision for them. With the official website for the game now online, details of the differences between the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch versions were unveiled, with some features being downgraded on the PS4. Although PS4 will have an exclusive VR mode that utilizes PlayStation VR, the PS4 version will remove the ‘Jet Black Fan’, the ‘Gold Fan’ and the ‘Softening Gel’. Each will be available as normal on Switch and each has their own abilities. The Black Fan and Gold Fan would blow gusts of wind at the characters, potentially making their clothing more revealing, while the Softening Gel would, well, make the breasts move about more. Obviously, the game isn’t for everyone (and it probably isn’t a game I’ll be clamoring for) but if you’re interested in it, the title will be available on March 20, 2019, for a retail price of 7,800 yen or in a special collector's edition variant for 12,800 yen. If you aren’t, well, at least you’ll be receiving a new mainline fighting game in the series, Dead or Alive 6, one month before this releases, on February 15, 2019. Further details on the upcoming Dead or Alive: Xtreme 3 Scarlet can be found via the game's official website.|Dead or Alive, Dead or Alive Xtreme, DOA, Nintendo Switch, Switch, PlayStation 4, PS4

The arrest was made following the online sales of illegally modified Super Famicom Mini consoles that were exploited to include additional games outside of the originally intended catalog. Three exploited consoles were sold before the arrest, all of which amounted to 61,500 yen ($547 USD) in earnings. According to reports, the consoles were sold between April and May of this year and were modified to include five additional games outside of the included titles. One of these games was mentioned to be Super Mario Bros., which did not make an appearance on the bite-sized console originally. The man arrested was a 39-year-old resident of Kashima, Ibaraki by the name of Tomoyuki Miyamoto who admitted to undertaking the modifications himself. While it's currently unknown what his penalties will be for the infringements, Miyamoto is currently in custody after pleading guilty to the charges. Just earlier this year we saw arrests made in Osaka at numerous gaming bars that offered customers some playtime on Capcom's Monster Hunter World and Nintendo's Splatoon 2 while they sipped down a drink or two. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed about the case. Source: Anime News Network|Super Famicom Mini, Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo

Finishing up that Pokédex was a test of will and endurance, grinding through various routes and areas hoping to encounter that one Pokémon. Though as it turns out, collecting all the Pokémon in the real world as adults will have you testing your will and endurance at your office job, grinding through the hours to make roughly $1,600 so you can "Catch 'Em All". As it turns out, that's likely what Japanese Twitter user @sekai1215 did, posting on Twitter that he had gone in and purchased all 151 Pokémon plushes together which totaled to roughly $1,600 USD, or 180,000 yen. Shared across four photos, @sekai1215 showcases his massive collection, including a final shot that shows the evolutions of all three starters. 今日発売の初代151匹のぬいぐるみ全て買ったった️ざっと18万円 pic.twitter.com/Y7T1ore0S4 — せかい (@sekai1215) 16 November 2018 Following the release of Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! just last week, there's been a whole lot of love shared for the original 151 Pokémon both in Japan and internationally. We've discussed around the office how much we'd love to do what @sekai1215 did quite a few times now, so it's crazy to actually see the number put behind the purchase.

Ultimate' Is Set to be One of the Biggest Releases of the Year | N/A |With the year coming to an end in less than a month and a half, there is still one game yet to be released that is sure to dazzle Nintendo fans, old and new alike. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is to be released worldwide on December 7th, 2018 and I can speak for all fans when I say the hype is intensifying. Fans of the franchise are coming in online masses to pre-order the game in order to have it in their hands the day that it comes out, both physically or virtually. In fact, the pre-order numbers for SSB Ultimate are record-breaking for the Nintendo Switch so far with the game set to be one the biggest releases of the year. I, myself, pre-ordered the game so that I can use the hilarious looking Piranha Plant. A fan-favorite title since its first release in 1999, Super Smash Bros. has also become one of the most successful Nintendo exclusive franchises throughout the company’s history. The success of the game can be attributed to the fact that both older and younger gamers can enjoy it with an easy to maneuver control style mixed with the ability to play as a number of beloved characters. I have certainly spent many days and nights playing the past Super Smash Bros. games with friends and family. Each week leading up to the release seems to hold more news about the game such as new characters named to the roster like the aforementioned Piranha Plant and Incineroar, and the excitement has certainly been building. By the way Nintendo, I am still waiting for a surprise Waluigi announcement... please? Since the well-documented comparative failure of the Wii U, Nintendo has changed the tides with the Nintendo Switch to their favor with successful releases such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and recently, Pokemon: Let’s Go! this past week. The release of a new Super Smash Bros. is sure to keep the train of Nintendo successes going.

14728|2018-11-19|19:00||http://otaquest.com/castlevania-netflix-review/| News | Anime | [Review] A Flawed Yet Promising Start for Netflix’s ‘Castlevania’ Anime | N/A |I think I speak for the majority of Castlevania fans when I say that I’m thankful to Netflix. Konami’s treatment of the series has been spotty to say the least, with the infamous Lords of Shadow series being the company’s last foray with the series - except, of course, to make a few pachinko machines here and there. In lieu of support from its own parent company, then, Netflix and the creative team behind the Castlevania series are the only ones giving the well-established series any love. And it really deserves love - there’s so much to adore about the series, from it’s convoluted lore to its revolutionary gameplay mechanics. But does that mean that we should simply consume the new animated series and move on, without airing any complaints? Of course not. For as much as Netflix’s Castlevania series manages to capture so much of what made the games great - it’s gothic architecture, iconic characters and B-movie vibe - there’s plenty which prevents it from being truly great. And with the recent release of the second season on the streaming platform, there’s no better time to talk about it. The biggest problem the series faces is one of pacing. While the first season is quite well constructed, the second puts the main plot of Trevor, Alucard and Sypha’s quest to defeat Dracula on hold for most of its runtime, instead preferring to focus on the vampire side of things. And while that’s not such a bad thing - even the games ended up realizing vampires were more interesting than vampire hunters, after all - it does mean that the second season gets off to a slow start. But even if blaze through this slow start with Netflix’s beloved “binge-watching” method (as I did) and into the more action-packed second half, the show fails to deliver the kind of sucker punches that you can tell it really wants to. It’s clear that the animation staff at Powerhouse Studios are really talented, and manage to deliver some amazing pieces of key animation when it’s needed most, but for the most part, the show’s thrills are dragged down by dull shot composition and visual direction. An episode will go from an intensely detailed and fluid fight scene to a static back and forth dialogue scene - which not only throws the viewer out of the experience but undermines the viewer’s appreciation of the good bits. That being said, even during the rather bland dialogue scenes, there is a ray of light - that of the excellent characters, which are always giving it their all despite appearances. Much like the first season, the core trio of Trevor, Alucard, and Sypha are a joy to be around - mostly thanks to the excellent performance by Richard Armitage - and when focus shifts to the vampire side, newcomers Isaac and Hector provide a really interesting insight into why a human would choose to serve an undead master. And their master, none other than Dracula himself, deserves special mention. The first season gave us a fairly good insight into Dracula’s motives for his attacks on humanity, and the second season goes even deeper, as Dracula goes far beyond that of a simple antagonist and almost morphs into the main character himself in terms of how much the show focuses on him and his journey. It must be said that Graham McTavish’s performance as the iconic vampire is also excellent, bringing a timid ferocity to Dracula’s armchair monologues. In light of this, I’m hesitant to disparage the show too much. Especially when you also consider that the circumstances surrounding the overall release were clearly not ideal. While the ‘first season’ appeared on Netflix nearly a year ago, it’s clear that the events of that season really should have been a part of this ‘second season’ as well - which in turns leads to the problems with pacing that the show suffers from. It’s not like you can blame anyone for this, as Netflix had never greenlit anything like Castlevania before, and the writing team simply had to work with the conditions that they gave them. With that said, despite the rocky start for this animated Castlevania series, I’m optimistic about its future. Now that they’ve shown themselves to be successful, Netflix has already given them the greenlit for a ten-episode third season, which should spare the writing team from the problems of a split season. They’ve also left themselves with plenty of interesting threads to pick up for the next season and beyond - with many of them going far beyond the original games’ story and into new territory.

Ever since that important turning point, all of the games since have gotten the same treatment, and the world has been treated to multiple live concert performances of the series’ iconic tunes. Now that experience will be available to more people than ever before thanks to the magic of live streaming. The Japan-exclusive tour entitled The Legend of Zelda Concert 2018 will make three stops: one in Tokyo on November 22 at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall, one in Osaka on November 25 at the Orix Theater, and a final show returning to the same location in Tokyo on December 14. The Osaka show will have both a daytime and nighttime performance, and the second Tokyo show will be the one live streamed. In order to watch that live stream, you’ll have to head to this page on Nico Nico Douga and be ready to pay up. The regular price is 2500 yen, but if you are a premium member then it’s knocked down to 1860 yen. If you are okay with using Nico Nico Douga (there is English text and guidance), you’re really all set to watch this performance no matter where you may be. Who can forget that iconic E3 2011 unveiling of Skyward Sword - that first official taste of the legendary Symphony of the Goddesses tours? Seeing the show for myself in Kansas City was one of the most moving experiences I’ve experienced as part of video game fandom, and I’m seriously considering going out to see Promax’s take on the series’ music. After all, there will be a focus on the recently-released Breath of the Wild with the presence of an accordion, and special performances by both an ocarina and harp performer as well! If you’re able to make it to the concerts in person, check out the exclusive goods below!

Less than a month out from the release of their first studio album in two years, "ANTI ANTI GENERATION", Radwimps were finally ready to share the first song from the album with the music video for "Sokkenai". Fresh off Radwimp's upcoming album, "ANTI ANTI GENERATION", their latest "Sokkenai" is a lengthy, toned down departure from what many international fans may be used to, yet still a beautiful ode to love gained and love lost. Coming in as song number seven on the seventeen song tracklist, Radwimps have crafted a beautifully unique sound that, while I don't picture gaining as much traction internationally, will definitely hold its own here in Japan. Set to release in Japan on December 12, 2018, you can check out the full tracklist and coverart for Radwimp's upcoming "ANTI ANTI GENERATION" below: 01. Anti Anti overture 02. tazuna 03.

The hardcover/digital e-book includes 418 pages of pure sci-fi and horror style manga; all from the creator of Biomega and BLAME!, Tsutomu Nihei, who has absolutely hit gold with this collection. Geared toward young adult men in Japan, the Abara story features a city built up of large structures in a future apocalyptic world where in the streets of the city, something is preying on the inhabitants, creatures known as Gaunas. Possessing bone-like armor, these creatures move faster than the human eye and can leave unimaginable horror behind. “ABARA: COMPLETE DELUXE EDITION is a collectors’ edition showcasing one of the most visually striking of Tsutomu Nihei’s impressive body of works to date,” says Leyla Aker, Executive Vice President & Publisher. “Featuring color pages, fold-out illustrations, high-quality paper, and more, this hardcover volume will delight horror and action fans with the grotesque and fantastic beauty of the world Nihei has created.” While I am a fan of the gruesome and intricate art, I wish Nihei used more words than art in the series to portray certain scenes. But with an easy, simplistic plot in only 2 volumes, Abara continues to remain a personal favorite. ABARA: COMPLETE DELUXE EDITION is now available for pre-order via select retailers for $29.99 and also includes a short story titled “Digimortal.” A digital edition will also be available for $19.99 via viz.com and the VIZ Manga App, as well as from the Nook, Kobo, Kindle, iBooks, comiXology, and Google Play stores.|Abara, ABARA: COMPLETE DELUXE EDITION, Viz, Viz Media, Manga, Tsutomi Nihei

It's an infectious pop sound that perfectly fuses DAOKO's signature flow with Yasutaka Nakata's timeless production values that ultimately allows both artists to shine. Now the song has the perfect music video to match, which can be seen below: Shot throughout the streets of Shibuya, both on the well-known "Shibuya Crossing" and outside Shibuya 109, as well as various other in-house locations, the music video is a charming representation of both Yasutaka Nakata's usual music video quirks, as well as the general aura of raw power given off from DAOKO during her shots. There's no confusing a DAOKO music video, and "Bokura no Network" is no exception -- just with a slight tinge of Yasutaka Nakata's own flare. Released to coincide with DAOKO's latest studio album, "Shiteki Ryoko", the track comes in as the second song on the album in an already star-studded roster of talent. Definitely not to be slept on, you can check out even more DAOKO, as well as her latest album, via her official website.|daoko, Yasutaka Nakata, Bokura no Network, Dragalia Lost, Nakata

There was no questioning her musical talent, but paired with the incomparable production talents of Nor, she felt truly untouchable. From then we've seen Kizuna AI pair up with a number of different musical talents, including Yunomi and Avec Avec, which ultimately brings us back to where it all started. For this weeks Kizuna AI release, we see Nor return for the hyper-bubbly "miracle step". The latest track is a little more toned down than Nor's previous production work on "Hello, Morning", but ultimately hits just as many sweet notes. Full of glistening highs and delicate lows, the two's work never fails to amaze, ultimately leaving us desperate for more. Fortunately for us, we generally don't have to wait long for more, given Kizuna AI's current once-a-week release schedule, but you get where I'm going with this. There are still four tracks set to be released, and we know that during that time we'll see production from Taku Takahashi, TeddyLoid, De De Mouse, and MATZ, which leaves a whole lot to be excited about. We've been providing a whole lot of coverage on Kizuna AI these last few weeks, which is seemingly a trend that isn't going to slow down any time soon. With Kizuna AI continuing to expand her brand beyond the confines of her YouTube origins, it'll be exciting to see where she ends up in the near future.

With that being said, that doesn't mean the brand can't tap into its uniquely Japanese roots, and in doing so, we're offered the latest BAPE x Naruto Shippuden collaborative collection. Available as of November 17 at BAPE locations across Japan, it'll be interesting to see just how long stock lasts. A BATHING APE® is launching collaboration items with TV animation “NARUTO Shippūden” of the battle action manga “NARUTO” created by Masashi Kishimoto and its spin off, “BORUTO: NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS”. The main characters in the animation are featured in the original Baby Milo® style. Items will be available on Saturday, 17 November at A BATHING APE® locations. Collaboration items with BORUTO will be released on the same day at BAPEXCLUSIVE™ Aoyama, Kyoto, BAPE STORE® DSM Ginza and BAPE.COM WEB STORE. These last few months have proven interesting for anime-related collaborations from BAPE and sub-brand AAPE. One of the most noteworthy that we've stumbled across is the recent times is the Gundam x AAPE collaborative MG RX-78-2 model kit that went on sale at the Gundam Base in Odaiba, Tokyo.

14715|2018-11-16|16:00||http://otaquest.com/yakuza-online-release/| News | Games | ‘Yakuza Online’ Mobile Game to Release on November 21 | N/A |Fans of Sega’s long-running Yakuza series have been eagerly awaiting the next installment of the series ever since the release of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life at the beginning of this year, and it looks like they won’t have much longer, as the series’ first mobile game has finally been scheduled for release on November 21. Titled Ryu ga Gotoku Online (Yakuza Online), the game will follow the series’ new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga as he works alongside longtime franchise favorites, including Majima and Kiryuu, to take back Kamurocho from the police and the rival Omi Alliance. The official Twitter account for the game has been teasing the various gameplay elements that will feature in the game ever since it’s announcement in August, which are mostly taken from the various minigames of the mainline franchise - including the cabaret club minigame. 本日はキャバ嬢紹介ムービーをお届け！ 気になる嬢の声や会話シーンを少しだけお見せしちゃいます！https://t.co/JupAEPQaNU #龍オン #龍が如く pic.twitter.com/vrQ6u9fGkT — 『龍が如く ONLINE』公式アカウント (@RyuOnline_PR) 14 October 2018 But almost more important than the gameplay itself is the game’s significance to the franchise - after all, longtime main protagonist Kazuma Kiryu will no longer be the focus of the franchise going forward, with The Song of Life essentially being his final game. Yet his inclusion in the cast of characters of the mobile game clearly makes this more a baton-pass moment for the franchise, as we’ll see Kasuga and Kiryu work together before Kasuga goes on to be the fully fledged series protagonist in the next console game, currently titled Shin Ryu ga Gotoku (New Yakuza). It’s clear that the developers are aware of this as well, as the launch livestream for the game - scheduled for November 19 - will feature the voice actors for both Kasuga and Kiryu alongside some other celebrity guests. And while I hope we get some more concrete information on the gameplay of the mobile game besides the snippets we’ve been getting via Twitter, I almost wouldn’t mind if the entire livestream was just a farewell party for Kiryu. He’s earned it, after all. For further information, check out the game’s official website.|Yakuza Online, Yakuza, Sega, Yakuza Mobile
14714|2018-11-16|15:00||http://otaquest.com/sword-art-onling-jcc-collab/| News | Anime , Manga | ‘Sword Art Online’ Teams Up with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce | N/A |It’s not just in the virtual world where Kirito and his friends have power - that’s clearly something that the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry believe, as they announced their new “collaboration” with the Sword Art Online series today. While I’m sure Reki Kawahara’s Sword Art Online series needs no introduction, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry is an organization that groups local and independent businesses together into one body that is focused on developing efficient production methods through innovation in business practices. As of March 2015, they boast around 1.5 million members with over 500 local bodies - making them a very powerful organization and an equally powerful player in the formation of the Japanese government’s economic policy. Therefore, it’s quite a big deal that the organization has decided to team up with SAO, of all franchises. In order to promote their new programming certification test, the JCCI are sharing a new image of Kirito, Eugeo, and Alice from the currently airing Alicization series with the bold tagline of “Programming is a holy skill of the future!” - referencing the fact that spells in the world of Alicization are called ‘holy skills.’ Given that computer literacy in Japan is particularly bad - due to many historical reasons, including the late adoption of kanji into DOS - it’s not such a bad idea that the JCCI have decided to team up with SAO. After all, the show is all about future technology, and it has a considerable following among the teen demographic - and getting them to link learning programming with the fictional VR gaming technology in the show might not be such a giant leap. This also ties into the JCCI’s focus on innovation, and if you’ve ever set foot inside a Japanese company, you’ll probably understand why business practices need to be shook up a bit. Fax machines are still used, for crying out loud. Here’s hoping that the power of Kirito can help the JCCI in its quest, even just a little bit.|Sword Art Online, Japanese Chamber of Commerce
14713|2018-11-16|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/japan-tattoo-victory/| News | N/A | Tattooing in Japan Enjoys a Hard-Fought Victory | N/A |This last year has been an interesting one for the tattooing industry in Japan, one that Kotaku writer and published author Brian Ashcraft has done an amazing job covering extensively. While news had fallen relatively silent over the past couple of months following a ruling made by the Osaka High Court last fall, it was reported yesterday that the court's decision to sentence Taiki Masuda over tattooing without a medical license had been overturned. This not only was a moment of relief for Taiki Masuda but a major turning point for the somewhat taboo tattoo industry in Japan as a whole. Tattooing in Japan has long existed as a legal grey-area following a number of status changes throughout the years, ultimately putting the culture in a less than desirable place. But in 2015 things took a turn for the worse when Osaka police raided Taiki Masuda's tattoo studio citing that he needed a medical license to practice his trade. This would eventually be taken to court, resulting in a much-documented case that would ultimately see Masuda losing, thus throwing the industry into a state of uncertainty. It's claimed that because tattooing involves the piercing of the skin, those practicing the trade require a medical license. The complication here is that there are no medical licenses specifically for tattoo artists, resulting in those wishing to practice the trade to become a fully-fledged doctor in the public eye. It's a confusing system and was something that left enough room for it to be practiced as a grey market trade. With the initial ruling, however, there was no longer questioning whether or not the police would turn a blind eye to the artform. With the rulings of the Osaka High Court yesterday, however, which would indeed lead to an overturn of the original case, the tattoo industry can once more sigh a breath of relief. During the overturn it was decided that tattooing should be viewed as an art form, rather than a medical practice. While this isn't necessarily the do all end all of decisions when it comes to the tattoo industry's existence in Japan, it certainly does offer a great precedent for future instances.

Fans will soon be able to purchase this premium art book that includes over 500 illustrations from the franchise, as well as a fold-out poster of the Dragon Quest timeline. Releasing on December 11, 2018, the print-only, hardcover edition collects a wide array of illustrations of the popular role-playing game (RPG) Dragon Quest, whose characters were notably designed by the legendary DRAGON BALL manga creator, Akira Toriyama. DRAGON QUEST ILLUSTRATIONS: 30th ANNIVERSARY EDITION will carry a $34.99 U.S. / $46.99 CAN pricepoint. “DRAGON QUEST ILLUSTRATIONS: 30th ANNIVERSARY EDITION celebrates Akira Toriyama’s lasting contributions to one of the most popular video game franchises of all time,” says David Brothers, Editor. “Dragon Quest has helped to shape the continued evolution of the RPG genre and Toriyama’s designs—created concurrently with his work on some of the best manga in the world—have always been a focal point of this celebrated series.” This proves yet again that they’re pushing the Dragon Quest IP here in the West, and I’m not upset, as I’ve personally hammered hundreds of hours into the series since Dragon Quest VII on PlayStation. With the recent release of Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age selling over the 4 million unit mark, and 75% of sales coming from Japan, Square-Enix still has a large hill to climb if they want the series to become successful in North America. I’m hoping they stick with it.|Dragon Quest, Akira Toriyama, Viz Media, Viz, Square Enix, Dragon Quest Illustrations
14703|2018-11-16|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/tales-of-vesperia/| News | Games | 'Tales of Vesperia' HD Remaster Receives New Trailer | N/A |Tales of Vesperia is an immensely important game to me. As I was growing up, video games played a huge part in forming the person I currently am — my being into gaming, anime and Japanese pop culture can be credited to my addiction to RPGs. Whether it was the dramatic flair of the Final Fantasy series, the addicting tactical strategy of Fire Emblem, or the flagrant anime-action of the Tales of series, I was very much becoming hooked to the biggest tropes of Japanese media through near-constant gaming. After Tales of Symphonia came Tales of Vesperia, a game I consider so damn near perfect that it’s hard for me to offer up any sort of alternative. The characters unique and with sharp personality; the action battle system evolved; the only negative I can even possibly think up is that it wasn’t available to more people, as it released only on the Xbox 360 in North America. That’s about to change. Take a look at the latest trailer showing off the remastered PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch port: Most exciting about this is that it will be the first time international console Nintendo fans get a taste of the series since 2008’s Wii game Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World. I implore you to try one of the greatest RPGs ever released when the game comes out next year, including the never-before-seen (outside of Japan) pirate character Patty!|Tales of Vesperia, Nintendo Switch, Bandai Namco
14702|2018-11-15|18:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-switch-1000-games/| News | Games | Nintendo Celebrates Over 1,000 Games on Switch | N/A |Only two years into its lifecycle and Nintendo is already celebrating the release of over 1,000 games on the Nintendo Switch. That's no small feat, especially given the Wii U failed to even reach the four-digit mark within its entire lifespan. But with that being said, what are all these games, and just how did Nintendo come to the conclusion that they had achieved that milestone? While it certainly doesn't answer that overarching question, Nintendo UK did release a celebratory video to highlight just a portion of the games that made it possible. Opening to the tune of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the trailer quickly directs viewers attention towards a slew of other in-house and AAA titles for the Nintendo Switch. All in all, however, we only see a total of 12 games showcased in this trailer -- 11 if you don't count Pokémon: Let's Go! as two games -- so that only further begs to ask, just what are the other 9,988 titles? Well, it would turn out its a lot of different titles, including over eight games that feature the word "Mario" in their title. It's a lot of indie titles, it's a lot of AAA action, and it's probably a sizeable amount of fun overall. Whatever it is, the Nintendo Switch actually has a decently sized library -- though I'm not gonna go and vouch for all of the games in that library. While the number of titles on the console sits around the 1,200 mark, it's quite quickly catching up to the likes of Sony's PlayStation 4 which holds around 1,800 titles, as well as Microsoft's Xbox One at 1,700 titles. I probably couldn't name more than 30 titles on the Nintendo Switch, but them keeping track of over 1,000 is definitely an impressive feat, and one that the company should probably give themselves a pat on the back for. We're sure we'll be seeing that number increase over these next couple of years too, so until then, we'll be sure to keep you up-to-date on all (maybe not all) the latest releases, as they happen.|Nintendo Switch, Nintendo, Switch
14701|2018-11-15|16:00||http://otaquest.com/fire-force-david-productions-anime/| News | Anime , Manga | David Productions to Helm Adaptation of ‘Soul Eater’ Creator’s ‘Fire Force’ | N/A |Is it me, or is it getting a bit hot in here? Perhaps it’s something do with the recent announcement of an anime adaptation of Atsushi Ohkubo’s Fire Force manga, which has left me a little more than hot under the collar in anticipation. Launched in 2015 not long after Ohkubo’s long-running and incredibly popular series Soul Eater came to end, Fire Force takes place in alternate Tokyo which is terrorized by “Infernals” - fire-based destructive beings that threaten the very existence of the human race. To counter this threat, special firefighting squadrons comprised of people with special abilities are formed, and it is into one such squadron that our protagonist, Shinra Kusakabe, enters with the intention of helping people as well as solving the mystery behind his family’s death in a fire some years ago. Despite the changes that Ohkubo has had to endure as a creator - not only a stark departure in subject matter from Soul Eater but also changing magazine from Monthly Gangan to Weekly Shonen Magazine - these have not had an adverse effect on the series. Rather, it has continued to entertain since it’s inception, both due to the author’s own creativity as well as his decision to slowly open up the story and it’s world over time. It’s also been a solid success for Magazine, in which the series shares pages with such heavy hitters as Hajime no Ippo and The Seven Deadly Sins. With that in mind, it’s very exciting for me to be able to say that after nearly three years of publication - which is a pretty long time considering Ohkubo’s previous successes - the manga has finally been picked up for an anime adaptation. And helming the project will be none other than the now legendary David Productions, who aside from being almost single-handedly responsible for the recent Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure boom, have also seen considerable success with their recent adaptation of Cells at Work. Given David Productions’ incredible track record, I have no doubt that the Fire Force adaptation will be a very good adaptation, if not even better than the original manga - after all, there’s plenty of things for the talented staffers at David Productions to work with, from the inventive character designs to the multitude of fire-based abilities that can only benefit from full animation. They’ve also demonstrated in recent times that they’re not afraid to change elements of the original for the sake of a good adaptation - something that far too many studios are far too afraid of doing. As a result, even though details on the adaptation are very scarce - with no staff or even a release date being shared - I can’t help but be incredibly stoked for what should be an excellent adaptation of a great manga. If you’d like to check out the manga in the meantime, then Kodansha Comics are translating the volumes into English, here.|Fire Force, David Productions, Atsushi Ohkubo, Soul Eater, Kodansha
14700|2018-11-15|15:00||http://otaquest.com/fans-stranded-idolmaster/| News | Anime , Music | Fans Stranded in Saitama After ‘iDOLM@STER’ Concert | N/A |When you’ve just spent four hours sweating buckets at a concert, just about the only thing you want to do is have a bath and go to sleep - not get stranded in the middle of nowhere. But that’s exactly what happened to many fans of the iDOLM@STER series who went to one of the franchise’s concerts last weekend. Saitama prefecture’s MetLife Dome played host to the sixth annual iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls (or Deremas) concert, and while this may have been one of the biggest venues for the franchise yet - with an overall capacity of around 36,000 people - it certainly seems as though the public transport system was not prepared at all for the mass of people that were to descend upon it. That being said, arrival at the venue went very smoothly for fans, as people tend to arrive at different times depending on if they want to purchase goods before the live or not, but it was after the live that true chaos descended on the station, as the whole stadium poured out at the same time towards Seibu Kyujou-mae station, all tired and all wanting to head home after a fun, yet no doubt exhausting live event. The sheer mass of people quickly overwhelmed the station, and far from the crowd thinning once the trains started departing, it only grew - leading to some truly “hellish” scenes being posted on social media. It’s unclear what the problem was, as the station staff had clearly done what preparation they could beforehand, having put out fences to funnel the crowd towards the entrance gates, but the sheer mass of people quickly shut down the entire station. This also lead to two of the lines that pass through the station, the Seibu Yamaguchi and Sayama lines, to have to cease operations entirely, which led to trains further back along the line to be delayed considerably. According to some fans who were waiting towards the back of crowd, it took nearly an hour and a half for them to get home from the end of the live - and that’s to say nothing of those who were further along the line than them who simply wanted to get home from work on that Friday night! Regardless of why this abject failure on the Seibu railway company’s part happened, it’s clear that the organizing staff for iDOLM@STER concerts, and concert staff, in general, will have to seriously consider whether or not to use the MetLife Dome again for their events. It’s simply something that shouldn’t be happening, especially when downtown Tokyo can function so well despite far more people being concentrated in the stations during rush hour. As one Twitter user put it, “iM@S may be the best, but Seibu Kyujou-mae is the worst!”. Source: Matomame|iDOLM@STER, Idolmaster, Saitama

If you haven't had a chance to check out the theme song, I'd definitely recommend it. Despite its ice-cold name, the track is a total heater, and I'm sure the sequences in which it appears during the film will be equally intense. But that's not the most important part of the track; instead, I'm going to direct your attention to Super Saiyan Blue Goku on the cover. Released as one of two alternative covers for the single release of "Blizzard", Goku's looking fresh in his 19 A/W blizzard fit from hair to toe. Honestly, it looks like the sort of cover I'd expect to see anywhere but an official Dragon Ball release, but I'm completely for it -- especially if we get some new streetwear pieces out of it too. On the flip-side, we see vocalist Daichi Miura rocking a similar fit for the standard digital edition of the single release. With the street fashion industry pulling numerous cues from both anime and manga over recent years, it's exciting to see a reverse inception of such styles. Screening in theaters across Japan as of this week, and set to begin screening in North America from January 16, 2019, Dragon Ball Super: Broly is shaping up to be on a whole other level, and I can't wait to check it out. Those interested in checking out even more on the upcoming film, be sure to take a look at its official website.|Daichi Miura, Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Super, Broly, Hypebeast Goku
14697|2018-11-15|13:00||http://otaquest.com/tetris-effect-review/| News | Games | [Review] Everything Falls Into Place in Tetris Effect | After spending a significant enough amount of time with Tetris Effect on PlayStation VR, we've compiled our thoughts on the rhythmic tile-dropping action. |At the intersection of music and video games, there are two names that immediately come to my mind. The first is Naoki Maeda, credited with birthing arcade games like Beatmania and Dance Dance Revolution, Maeda and his team successfully married the gameplay elements to the music, making addicting arcade games that you still see regularly played in Japan and America a full twenty years after their inception. The second, is Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the creator of games like Rez, its successor, Child of Eden, Lumines, and Meteos, who wove the visual elements together with the music in an attempt to convey the sense of Synesthesia, a phenomenon that people describe as being able to ‘see’ music. His first attempt at that, Rez, was a cult title from the Dreamcast era, and ever since its release I have followed each and every title that Mizuguchi has worked on, from Every Extra Extend to Ninety-Nine Nights, and I thought that the Lumines games released on the PSP would be the end all be all of Tetris rivals. But what happens when Mizuguchi gets to put his hands directly on Tetris? Well, you get Tetris Effect. I don’t think I really need to explain Tetris, but let’s just get this out of the way. It’s the same gameplay it has always been, blocks are falling, create lines of blocks to eliminate them from the field, and if they reach the top, it’s game over. Okay, that’s done. But what is it that makes this version so special? The original is still a classic and is regularly played at a competitive level amongst seasoned pros, along with all variations of Tetris: The Grand Master. Tetris is a game that has endured. But it is with the touch of Mizuguchi, bringing the element of Synesthesia blending the visual and audio elements to create an experience that is very much different from anything that came before it, but still maintains that intense satisfaction that one can experience by playing Tetris. If there’s a ‘preferred’ way to experience Tetris Effect, I would have to recommend it be played with a PSVR headset, if only for the immersion factor alone. Tetris Effect is a beautiful game from both a visual and audio perspective, and as a fan of Rez VR, I knew what I was getting in to; but at the same time, I still wasn't prepared for what I was about the see and hear. Even from the initial trailer for Tetris Effect, I knew this was going to be something special, and across the game’s ‘Journey’ and ‘Effect’ modes, the experience is nothing short of phenomenal. Even without the immersion of VR, the teams at Monstars and Resonair have outdone themselves. But let’s get into the how and why. The ‘Journey’ mode is the base game for Tetris Effect -- spread across 27 different stages, broken up into three to five song blocks, each grouping boasts a wide variety of visuals and sounds. The first course starts with what could be considered the game’s theme song, ‘Connected,’ an uplifting pop song with undersea visuals set to the backdrop of the earth, and after clearing the requisite number of lines, the song in the block comes up, ‘Pharaoh’s Code,’ with its own set of unique visuals and sounds, and this continues through to the final stage, ‘Metamorphosis.’ The gameplay for Journey mode is best described as Tetris meets Lumines. One thing Lumines loved to do was alter the speed of the blocks to keep gamers on their toes, and they’ve brought that over to Tetris Effect with what I consider to be a pretty good success. It keeps things interesting and doesn’t just smother the player in faster and faster speeds like a normal round of Tetris would. If I’m looking for that classic flavor of Tetris gameplay, then it’s over to the ‘Effect’ modes. In Effect mode, players can find a number of different game modes, like Infection, that requires players to clear the ‘infected’ blocks in order to keep things from spreading out of control, or the classic Marathon mode, where 150 lines need to be cleared as quickly as possible. Effect mode also features weekly community events that allow players to contribute to a weekly goal by playing the requisite modes, participating in these events will unlock new avatars that can be used to represent your player on the global leaderboards. In addition to this there is a personal leveling system, and clearing different stages will award experience points toward your level, and while there is the chance for duplicate avatars to get picked up, those duplicates result in bonus experience, which is a nice addition, since it’s very likely that some of these avatars are going to be ‘rare.’ So, to say Mizuguchi has some experience with combining visual and music elements to great effect is something of an understatement, and this is especially true with Tetris Effect. Every stage in this game has visuals to match the audio component, and they intersect in interesting ways. Playing the stage, ‘Da Vinci,’ players are sent flying through the air with the tetrominoes displayed as gears that turn with each line clear, and the sounds of tetrominoes falling compliments the music track. Each level does this to varying levels of success, and to say there is a ‘bad’ track in the bunch is nearly impossible. The different styles may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but there is certain to be one track out there at the very least every person can latch on to. The discordant piano of Downtown Jazz, or the EDM festival sound of Celebration, the work put down by composer Noboru Mutoh, and the Hydelic group is a master class in video game soundtracks that to me, only compares with Keiichi Okabe’s NieR: Automata soundtrack in terms of ‘near-perfection.’ The VR functionality of Tetris Effect is what really separates this game from its peers and elevates it to ‘Game of the Year’ contention. When you combine the immersion of playing Tetris with the visual and auditory elements, it left me in a state of something short of ecstacy. And to try to describe that feeling is complicated. I feel like this effect is going to vary from person to person, but for me, it’s about a sense of control. To play Tetris Effect is to take control of a very chaotic situation, and when I’m clicking, and the game is going my way, the game responds in kind with explosions of color and sound. It’s incredibly easy for me to find a rhythm while playing this game, I’m tapping my foot, I’m bobbing my head, the tetrominoes are falling in time with the music. It all melts together into this sensation that is both calming and euphoric, which is something I haven’t experienced since, maybe the first Lumines game. The medical term ‘Tetris Effect’ is described as the result of intense focus and repetition, as studied with the use of the game Tetris, people who played the game could remember seeing the tetrominoes, even after playing the game, out of the corner of their eyes, or as part of their dreams. Playing Tetris Effect is like experiencing one of those dreams, as Mizuguchi and his teams at Monstars and Resonair have woven music and impressive visuals wrapped in the Unreal Engine into one of the most visually arresting games released in this current generation of hardware. It’s not enough that I tell you that you need to play Tetris Effect, you need to experience it -- there really is nothing else like it.|Tetris Effect, Tetris, PlayStation VR, Tetris VR, Tetris Effect Review

Scheduled to hit theaters across North America on February 14, 2019, the upcoming film adapts Yukito Kishiro's 1990 manga series Battle Angel Alita and brings its cyberpunk setting and dystopian world to life in a blend of live-action and CG content that's sure to be a spectacle. Focusing on the fast-paced sport of the future, Motorball, the latest trailer highlights Alita's struggles with her past, as well as the threat it presents to her present. The film looks visually incredible, with director Robert Rodriguez seemingly doing an excellent job of representing the source material onscreen. The film is described by 20th Century Fox below: From visionary filmmakers James Cameron (AVATAR) and Robert Rodriguez (SIN CITY), comes ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL, an epic adventure of hope and empowerment. When Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past – she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control. If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she’s grown to love. Set to release in theaters across North America on February 14, 2019, this might just be the film to keep an eye on at the beginning of next year. Those interested in checking out even more information on the film, including staff listings and theaters, be sure to check out the film's official website.|Alita: Battle Angel, Alita, Battle Angel

So you can bet we were excited to hear that the legendary Evangelion series will be opening an izakaya of its own - but not without a distinctly Evangelion flavor, of course. Set to open November 16 in Ikebukuro, the ‘Evangelion Pub’ will be serving up more than 30 different Evangelion-themed food and drink items for fans of the series to enjoy. The menu will draw inspiration from scenes and famous lines from the series for its offerings, such as the “I Mustn't Run Away! Super Spicy Mapo Tofu Bowl” and the “Anta Bataaa? Asuka’s Corn Butter” dish. Furthermore, the various drinks on offer - many of which are themed after the Evangelion units themselves - are all only 390 yen, which makes the pub very competitive with the cheap prices of other, regular izakayas. What’s more is that ordering a drink will enter you into a prize draw, from which you can receive a special calendar for the year ahead. And speaking of the year ahead, this year is a rather special one as it will mark the last year of the ‘Heisei’ era, with Japan’s current Emperor abdicating at the end of the year, thus bringing in a new, as of yet unnamed era presided over by his son, Naruhito. To ring in the end of this historic period, the pub will also be hosting an event with none other than Yoko Takahashi on December 26, who lent her voice to the series’ original opening song, A Cruel Angel’s Thesis. Other events are set to be announced (including a ‘rock-paper-scissors grand tournament’) so keep your eye on the official Evangelion website for more details, here. The full menu for the pub can also be found here. You’ll have until January 6, 2019, to check it out.|Evangelion, Neon Genesis Evangelion
14690|2018-11-14|16:00||http://otaquest.com/detective-conan-usj-return/| News | Anime | 'Detective Conan' Returns to Universal Studios Japan With New Mystery Attraction | Detective Conan is making his grand return to Universal Studios Japan in 2019 with a mysterious new attraction. |Universal Studios Japan is already looking set to have an excellent 2019, with new Lupin the Third, Attack on Titan, and even a Godzilla vs. Evangelion attraction already confirmed for their ‘Cool Japan’ area, but how’s one more legend to add to the mix? Returning for the third year in a row and with a 99% attendee approval rating is the Detective Conan “real mystery” attraction, this time armed with an entirely new scenario for budding detectives to solve. Details on the attraction’s content are vague - as expected of a mystery attraction, perhaps - but the overall scenario for the mystery has been shared. Visitors to the attraction will embark on a “mystery solving tour” in a western-style mansion for a fun weekend getaway, but will soon find themselves thrust into a real mystery featuring all of their favorite Conan characters. While I didn’t have the opportunity to participate in the attraction last year, that 99% approval rating is nothing to sniff at. Especially when the attraction requires an additional ticket of 2980 yen on top of the regular entrance fee - clearly attendees have historically felt that they have gotten their money’s worth. Also returning alongside the mystery game will be the “Mystery Challenge” attraction and the “Mystery Restaurant” themed restaurant. While the latter is rather self-explanatory, the former has guests going around the park and solving a mystery based on the various attractions and areas. Those who complete it will receive special goods as a reward, and given that it’s free I’d definitely recommend giving it a go. From my own experience, you’ll be able to solve it pretty easily and quickly throughout the day anyway. With the announcement of Conan’s return, USJ’s 2019 is looking to be one of the best years the park has had in a very long time. Along with its western-themed attractions, the park now has a very sizeable line-up of distinctly Japanese attractions that will be enjoyed by both domestic tourists and international tourists alike. If you’re thinking of taking advantage of this incredible line-up, then don’t hesitate to check out the park’s official website for more information, including additional tickets for certain attractions and restaurant bookings.|Detective Conan, Case Closed, Universal Studios Japan, USJ

With a total global population of 7.2 billion people, there's only a 0.0000005% of people actually honored enough to marry Hatsune Miku, and the most recent person to join this list is Akihiko Kondo, a 35-year-old school administrator in Japan. Taking place at Tokyo Town Hall, the 40-person wedding would go on to cost Kondo roughly $17,000 in fees. 本日11月4日、近藤顕彦さんと初音ミクさんの結婚式に参列、結婚立会人としてサインさせて頂きました メディアでは賛否両論で話題に。 私は、幸せは色々な形があっていいと思います。他人に迷惑をかけるわけでもなく、本人たちが幸せなら祝福したいと思います 顕彦さんミクさん、結婚おめでとう pic.twitter.com/iKhM4E2PWH — 山田太郎前参議院議員@3日目S24a (@yamadataro43) November 4, 2018 Though it might sound slightly odd for someone to get married to a virtual character, Akihiko Kondo identifies himself with a minority group that feels no affection to three-dimensional girls, citing intense bullying from female co-workers as a driving force in his withdrawal. Photographed at the wedding alongside his own Hatsune Miku plushie, in all actuality Kondo would be marrying his Gatebox device in which an AI hologram of Hatsune Miku lives. It's been a few months since we made our way over to Gatebox HQ in Akihabara to check out their next-generation Gatebox device, and since then we've seen a number of changes. While I'm not confident those changes are enough to make me want to marry the device, it's a neat little piece of hardware that I could certainly see becoming a part of my daily lifestyle. Following the marriage, Gatebox additionally provided Akihiko Kondo with a marriage certificate, though I'm not sure if it's actually something that would hold up in court. While not everyone will agree with his actions, I'm glad to see Akihiko Kondo has found himself a little place of happiness in the form of Hatsune Miku. |Hatsune Miku, Gatebox, Miku, Hatsune Miku Marriage

It was because of these images that we saw news break that BTS appearance on TV Asahi's "Music Station" would be dropped, with the announcement made right before their dome tour in Japan was set to begin. The topic was relatively silent on BTS' front, but today we saw the release of an official apology and response from their agency Big Hit Entertainment. Within the official apology, Big Hit Entertainment states that they “had no intention of causing distress or pain” to victims and families of those affected by the Hiroshima bombing and that they would be reaching out to the appropriate organizations “in order to explain and apologize for the hurt caused by these issues.” I can never accept the act that #BTS member wore the atomic bomb T-shirts humanely. The problem is not the relation between Japan and Korea. It's just humanity. pic.twitter.com/x37nZs8pJG — 髙橋裕司 (Yuji T) (@YuJett) 9 November 2018 While much blame can be placed on the member of the group donning the shirt, it can also be said that just as much blame can be put on the stylist who suggested that they wear the shirt in the first place. Within the entertainment industry, and especially when you reach the level of a group like BTS, it's not uncommon for talents to have little-to-no control over what they wear, with a special advisor selecting their daily wardrobe. In response to this, Big Hit Entertainment shared that the team “did not do appropriate research” before again apologizing. Much like the rest of the world, the Korean Pop craze has been sweeping Japan, with BTS currently sitting atop the throne. It's because of this that a sound level of knowledge is especially important, and also why the news came as such a shock to fans in Japan. The news has also sparked much political discussion across the internet, especially amongst much of North Asia. While BTS still has a total of eight shows to go on their Japan "Love Yourself" tour, including their final Tokyo show tonight, it'll be interesting to see how everything transpires. Fans flocked to the streets of Shin Okubo, Japan's own "Korea Town" earlier today hoping for a rare chance to spot any of the group members, essentially shutting down the entire train station for an entire hour.

Well, I'm happy to share that the wait is finally over and that you can peep Detective Pikachu and his Pokémon friends in full, gorgeous 3DCG. Check it out below, followed by Warner Brother's official synopsis! The first-ever live-action Pokémon movie, “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” stars Ryan Reynolds as the titular character in the first-ever live-action movie based on the iconic face of the global Pokémon brand—one of the world’s most popular, multi-generation entertainment properties and most successful media franchises of all time.Fans everywhere can now experience Pikachu on the big screen as never before, as a talking detective Pikachu, a Pokémon like no other. The film also showcases a wide array of beloved Pokémon characters, each with its own unique abilities and personality. The story begins when ace private eye Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son Tim to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry’s former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu: a hilariously wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth who is a puzzlement even to himself. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to communicate with one another, Tim and Pikachu join forces on a thrilling adventure to unravel the tangled mystery. Chasing clues together through the neon-lit streets of Ryme City—a sprawling, modern metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side in a hyper-realistic live-action world—they encounter a diverse cast of Pokémon characters and uncover a shocking plot that could destroy this peaceful co-existence and threaten the whole Pokémon universe. “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” also stars Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) as Tim; Kathryn Newton (“Lady Bird,” TV’s “Big Little Lies”) as Lucy, a junior reporter following her first big story; and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe (“Godzilla,” “The Last Samurai”) as Lt. Yoshida. Directed by Rob Letterman (“Goosebumps,” “Monsters Vs.

Visual effects are by Moving Picture Company (“Wonder Woman”) and Framestore (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”). Launched in 1996 to overwhelming response, the Pokémon brand is a global sensation that now encompasses a robust video gaming fandom with over 300 million units sold worldwide; the Pokémon Trading Card Game available in 11 languages with more than 23.6 billion cards shipped; an animated television series in its 21st season that is available in more than 160 countries; and over 20 animated films; as well as books, manga comics, music, toys, merchandise, and apps, including the wildly popular Pokémon GO, that has been downloaded over 850 million times and is enjoyed across the globe by fans of all ages. “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” is set for release on Friday, May 10, 2019. The film will be distributed outside of Japan and China by Warner Bros. Pictures, in Japan by Toho Company, Ltd. and by Legendary East in China. This looks... really good. I didn't really know what to expect when it came to blending the CG Pokémon with the real environments and human actors, but it just works so well here. All that fur though -- I mean, I KNEW that Pokémon were technically animalistic, furry creatures, but seeing it even on Jigglypuff? There's definitely something to be said about adaptations of popular animated/game-related properties, but this film might just be on to something. Wile the movie is currently slated for a May 10, 2019 release in North America, fans of the Pokémon franchise will have ample time to play through both Detective Pikachu on Nintendo 3DS, as well as the upcoming Pokémon: Let's Go! titles on Nintendo Switch. While we're sure there's going to be a whole lot more to uncover about the upcoming film, we've definitely got a glimmer of hope that they might just hit it out of the park with this one, again thrusting the franchise into the spotlight.

14670|2018-11-12|13:00||http://otaquest.com/yoshino-yoshikawa-onjuicy-rpg-intrv/| News | Music | Yoshino Yoshikawa & ONJUICY Talk Real Life Struggle In New Single 'RPG' | We had a chat with Ultrapop producer Yoshino Yoshikawa and rapidly-rising Japanese grime MC ONJUICY about the real life struggles behind their latest single 'RPG'. |The influence of hip-hop within Japan’s netmusic scene is certainly with strong precedence, but for those following premiere “Ultrapop” producer Yoshino Yoshikawa, who has always adhered closely to their maximalist deconstruction of J-Pop and “kawaii” sounds most prominently defined on labels such as Maltine Records, listeners may find themselves surprised to hear him embrace new influences on his latest single “RPG.” A relentless, sometimes overwhelming, yet nevertheless stylistic bombardment of chirpy sounds with adrenaline-fueled rapping, referencing musical motifs from Pokémon & carrying the attitude of producers such as Ryan Hemsworth in more playful moments, “RPG” (with b-side “Green Hill”) features the stylings of ONJUICY, an MC who has been a proponent of Tokyo’s burgeoning grime scene. Grime, a genre from London emerging in the early ‘00s, which takes cues from hip-hop and other electronic genres, is singular in its own rhythmic and uniquely frantic-tempo'd stylization of rap. In Japan, where there are arguably more grime DJs than MCs, ONJUICY’s musical outings hold a bit more weight than the grime of the UK, situating them as a notable figure to Tokyo’s scene. They’ve been situated closely with TREKKIE TRAX & the hard-hit stayers of the local bass community - Maru, Carpainter, Double Clapperz, to name a few. To Yoshikawa’s own attestment, hip-hop has always been a love. DJs and UK friends saw his fascination as a gateway to get him into grime, and it wasn’t long that Yoshikawa began to cite the likes of Mumdance, Novelist, Sir Spyro, and AJ Tracey as inspirations. Luckily, grime-legend Skepta was to make their Boiler Room appearance at a vinyl shop in Shibuya, naturally, Yoshikawa wouldn’t miss this. After the show, he met one of the openers - ONJUICY, but it wasn’t till another show with Double Clapperz, that Yoshikawa finally popped him the question to collaborate after seeing his “extraordinary” performance. Yoshikawa was surprised to chat, the grime MC was sort of like him. “He likes a lot of popular culture, just like me,” mused Yoshikawa. “...like games & anime. He also made this song about Mobile Suit Gundam. I was convinced that we could share the same point of view.” They quickly set-up to meet for coffee at department store landmark Shibuya 109, where ONJUICY wrote the lyrics to “RPG” on the spot. A few days later, they recorded both tracks in one session. Despite their core bonding over lighter subject matter and the upbeat nature of the track on casual ears, the message underneath resonates a bit more seriously to both. “I’m singing about the life of people who are surviving in society using metaphors like “RPG” in both two songs,” explained ONJUICY. “I think that I can make success and I can be what I want to be in my own way by achieving the ‘levels’ of my game of life...” ONJUICY stressed it’s important to have your own goals and play by your own rules, and that overall his message is one of optimism. Such thoughts seem self-directed as well, discussing their dedication towards spreading the awareness of grime and even the smallest of appreciation being cherished. “I'm being motivated by simple comments like “Sick!” or “Awesome!” from all over countries.” Yoshikawa agreed with the serious nature behind such a genre, stressing the power of hip-hop & grime within Japan as well. “Hip-hop songs empower people who were devastated by the severity of reality by relating to the real-life stories of MCs in song. There are many problems related to economic inequality or minorities and identities in the world. Japan, a society with stronger cultural homogeneity, is no exception. But it’s sometimes difficult to find the discrimination and also difficult to visualize them. But still, there are a lot of problems.” But whether those problems be political or internal, the result still circles back to the connective tissue of hip-hop. “I want to try to help people with my songs like the songs of (rapper) Joey Bada$$ helped me,” notes Yoshikawa. “RPG” may be much like how the West sees Japan, or even how Japan sees itself. Frantic and bubbly, yet always tension beneath - something unseen, but intrinsically felt within its core by the people who choose to care and strive for difference. Trying our best to live honestly, but willing to shake things up a bit sometimes. How Yoshikawa plays his RPGs may be much like how he plays life. “I’d train my Blastoise up to Lv.100 without cheating. Of course, I enjoyed it a lot with glitches...”|Yoshino Yoshikawa, ONJUICY, RPG

Shared via Avex Music's official YouTube channel earlier this week, we got yet another look at what the group has been up to with their latest "stereo future" music video, a stand-out release that doubles as the opening theme to the upcoming video game title God Eater 3 on PlayStation 4. Originally formed in 2015 as a successor to BiS, BiSH (otherwise known as Brand-new idol SHiT) have been killing it in creating their own identity in an otherwise saturated idol industry. With a standout visual style as well as an intense musical presence, the six-member group have proven themselves time and time again, with their latest work on the God Eater 3 opening only further solidifying this. Released ahead of their upcoming 5th major single "stereo future", the song will be accompanied by b-side track "S・H・i・T" when it releases on December 5, 2018. Available via iTunes now ahead of the release the full single, "stereo future" is another incredible addition to BiSH's growing catalog of ground-breaking sounds and a perfect example of their capabilities.

It's been a long drawn out launch, but an essential one none the less; currently the Nintendo Switch sports an unbelievably low amount of streaming services, limited to both Hulu and now YouTube. With that being said, this is absolutely a massive step forward and hopefully points to a bright future for the capabilities for the device. Available as a free download via the Nintendo eShop, the YouTube application is completely accessible without the need for the recently launched Nintendo Switch Online service. We've been seeing rumors circulating for quite some time about the impending launch of the app, which obviously held their ground given today's release. Users will be able to watch YouTube both docked and un-docked and can make use of 360-degree viewing capabilities. I doubt many will have qualms with the release of YouTube, and I can only hope other services such as Crunchyroll and Netflix follow suit.

14654|2018-11-08|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/final-fantasy-xv-tabata/| News | Games | Square Enix's Final Vision for 'Final Fantasy XV' Likely Won't be Realized | Excuse me as I shed some tears for one of my favorite games done dirty. |This is an especially hard article for me to write. When Final Fantasy XV was released in the latter half of 2016, it went on to be my game of the year. If you had to ask me why, it would be due in no small part to two main factors: the relationship that is established between its four main characters, and its pretty amazing (at the time) open world. When Hajime Tabata took over for series veteran Tetsuya Nomura as the director on Final Fantasy XV, people were a bit skeptical, given that Tabata’s experience had been mostly in mobile gaming up to that point. But when the full game, which had at one point existed in a nebulous decade-long state as Final Fantasy Versus XIII, finally released as the new main game title in the series, fears were soon put to rest as it served to be both a critical and sales best-performer. Once the game was released and the hype had blown over, it did appear that the main story was lacking in a few ways, and Square Enix hoped to fill in some of the gaps with major DLC for most of the important characters. To date, separate DLC episodes with some unique gameplay have been released for three of the four characters in the main cast, and one episode featuring the game’s main antagonist is scheduled to be released early next year. However, DLC episodes concerning the game’s de-facto main protagonist Noctis and some other characters have been canceled, amounting to a full three-quarters of the planned DLC. This seems to be due to Hajime Tabata’s sudden departure from Square Enix. In a statement revealed on an official livestream regarding future plans for the game, it was stated that Tabata would be departing Square Enix, and the internal Final Fantasy Studio Luminous Productions in order to focus on his own gaming project. Shortly after, Square Enix issued a press release targeted at investors stating an “extraordinary loss” of 33 million US dollars. One of the only logical reasons for this loss would be the sudden inability for the company to produce the remaining DLC for one of its biggest titles due to the director’s sudden departure. But hey, some positive news still abounds! The massively-successful MMO Final Fantasy XIV is still getting an official XV crossover event, and XV’s next multiplayer expansion is still on as well as the aforementioned Episode Ardyn DLC! You can watch the entire presentation below (it has an expected larger amount of "dislikes" than "likes"): Now excuse me as I shed some tears for one of my favorite games done dirty, all while hoping the best for Tabata-san going forward.|Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy XV, Hajime Tabata
14653|2018-11-08|13:00||http://otaquest.com/kabukicho-sherlock-holmes-anime/| News | Anime | Production I.G.’s Original Anime ‘Kabukicho’ Revealed as Sherlock Holmes Adaptation | Through much speculation following the original teaser visual, we now finally know that the project will be based on the Sherlock Holmes mythos. |In the current anime landscape of seemingly nothing but manga and light novel adaptations, it’s always worth paying attention to original anime. So when we heard that the formidable Production I.G. was set to produce a new, original anime based on Tokyo’s infamous red-light district Kabukicho, we were intrigued, to say the least. Now, almost three months later, concrete details have finally been shared on the upcoming project, along with an all-new PV. You can check it out below: Through much speculation following the original teaser visual, we now finally know that the project will be based on the Sherlock Holmes mythos - which is a welcome surprise. I love the original stories and have always enjoyed a lot of the Japanese adaptations of them, not least of which the under-appreciated BONES project Gosick, so to have a studio with such a great track record as I.G. tackling the stories of Holmes is something I’m very much behind. To reflect this reveal, the title of the series has been changed once more to “Kabukicho Sherlock” from “Kabukicho no Yatsu,” which was in itself changed from the original reveal title of “Shinjuku-ku Kabukicho.” I hope that all of this confusing chopping-and-changing of titles will be worth it, and doesn’t represent some confusion on the development of the project’s part - after all, the idea for an original anime using Kabukicho as a setting has been floating around the studio ever since 2014. Nevertheless, it seems like the show is firmly set on its usage of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and will be incorporating several iconic characters from it into its cast. The most obvious inclusion is the character of Sherlock Holmes himself, who in this story is a lover of rakugo (which is presumably why he hangs around Kabukicho). Joining him will be his trusty assistant John Watson, who works as a coroner at the local university hospital. It’s worth noting that the gap in age between John and Sherlock seems much larger than in most other adaptations, with Sherlock sporting a fine head of grey hair and with John looking remarkably youthful. Another strange age gap presents itself in this adaptation’s versions of the characters Mary Morstan and James Moriarty. Firstly, Mary Marston is better known as Mary Watson, as she later marries John Watson in the original Sherlock Holmes stories. Yet, in this version, Mary is a “ko-gyaru” high school student, which surely makes John having an interest in her slightly weird. Moriarty is also a high school student, which would seem to limit the probability of him being an evil mastermind just yet. I can only think of one reason behind these rather significant departures from the original canon - that Production I.G. is setting up for several sequels in which both characters literally grow up and into the characters we know and love from the original canon. But before they even think about sequels, the first season will have to do well first - something which definitely isn’t “elementary, my dear Watson.”|Kabukicho Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes, Kabukicho, shinjuku
14652|2018-11-08|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/gundam-zeon-army-application/| News | Anime , Manga | New Gundam Collaboration Opens Up Applications for Zeon Army | A recently launched collaboration has seen applications open to join the fearless Principality of Zeon. |Have you ever wanted to join the army of the Principality of Zeon? If yes - whether it’s for ideological reasons, aesthetic reasons, or simply because you just really like Char Anzable - the Gundam series’ new collaboration with Men’s Bigen is allowing you to do just that. While the Gundam series needs no introduction, Men’s Bigen might warrant one. Simply put, it’s a men’s beauty and cosmetic company that focuses on hair bleaching. And while this may seem like a bit of a weird product for Gundam to be collaborating with at first, when you consider that many Gundam fans tend to be, well, old, it makes a little more sense. But more important than the collaboration itself are the two “quizzes” available on the collaboration website. The first, entitled “Principality of Zeon Army Admission Test” presents you with various Gundam trivia questions as it deems your worthiness of joining the Zeon army. It would take a true expert on the series to get a good rank though, as the questions are incredibly specific, especially towards the end of the quiz - in fact, it is reported that only 6% of those who have taken the quiz have been able to get the perfect S rank so far. If you thought that was hard though, then the “Principality of Zeon Promotion Test” is even harder. Not only are the questions even more specific, but just one wrong answer means you fail the quiz - meaning that only those who know their Gundam inside, out and back to front will be in with a chance of beating this one. Unsurprisingly, however, fans have received this challenge with fervor, perhaps even seeking to become the right-hand man of Char Anzable himself. The collaboration also offers various Gundam themed goods for use in conjunction with Men’s Bigen’s hair whitening products, such as an applicator in the shape of the Heat Hawk axe-type weapon. While I don’t have any interest in the products themselves, perhaps the company’s collaboration with Gundam may prompt those who have always hated their grey hair to finally do something about it. I’ll leave that up to you, though. You don’t have time to wait around before doing the quiz, however, because it’s only available until the end of this year. And trust me, once you see the difficulty of the questions firsthand, you’ll definitely want to be using the full time available to train and finally join the Zeon Army. Sieg Zeon!|Gundam, Zeon, Principality of Zeon

And what could be scarier than the real-life inspiration for Hinamizawa of the notoriously terrifying Higurashi no Naku Koro ni series? The village of Shirakawa was famous long before the Higurashi series came around, thanks to the abundance of traditional thatched-roof houses that have made it into a UNESCO Heritage Site, but it certainly never had a sinister air to it before the advent of Higurashi, in which author Ryukishi07 used photos of the village and many of its actual locations for his fictional village of Hinamizawa. Thankfully, the village has embraced this reputation, and as a result, welcomes a large proportion of anime tourists along with ‘normal’ tourists. But now, with the release of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni: Hou on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 - which brings together all of the main eight episodes alongside other, extra episodes into one package - the village is hosting a new stamp rally that will allow fans to explore the iconic locations from the series, while also receiving a limited edition badge featuring Hanyu. You can check out the map and badge below: The route starts in the tourist information center where you will receive your stamp sheet before embarking on a trail with a six stops where you will stamp your sheet. Shirakawa is a small village, so it shouldn’t take you long to complete, but the objective of the route is not to simply race around, but to take in the beautiful vistas - and maybe even snap a few pictures of Higurashi-esque locations on the way. Shirakawa village is located in Gifu Prefecture, just north of of Nagoya, and is pretty easy to get there from my own experience. All relevant information can be found via the village’s official website. The stamp rally will be running for around a month, from November 5 to December 10, so if you’ve always wanted an excuse to go check out this incredible piece tourism, both in a historical and otaku sense, then now is the perfect time.|Higurashi, When They Cry, stamp rally, Higurashi Stamp Rally
14644|2018-11-07|17:00||http://otaquest.com/umineko-gold-edition/| News | Games | What’s the Deal With ‘Umineko no Naku Koro ni: Gold Edition’? | Simply put, ‘Gold Edition’ will be (if crowdfunding goals are reached) a free update to the already released Steam English-language version of the Umineko game that adds - among other things - voice acting, character sprites and graphics from the beloved PS3 version of the game, as well as all new content from the original author himself. |Fans of the 07thExpansion game Umineko no Naku Koro ni have had it pretty good recently. Not only have YenPress been steadily translating the excellent manga adaptation, but the original game itself has finally come to English-language territories thanks to a partnership between the prolific MangaGamer and the original Umineko fan translation group, Witch Hunt. But many fans were perplexed when MangaGamer announced a crowdfunding effort for another Umineko project last week - that of ‘Umineko no Naku Koro ni: Gold Edition.’ Simply put, ‘Gold Edition’ will be (if crowdfunding goals are reached) a free update to the already released Steam English-language version of the Umineko game that adds - among other things - voice acting, character sprites and graphics from the beloved PS3 version of the game, as well as all new content from the original author himself. Those who back the project on Kickstarter will receive official merchandise of the series, which has always been limited - even in Japan. That being said, several aspects of Gold Edition are causing many fans to scratch their heads. Namely, the fact that this will be released as a free update to all owners of the Steam version of the game anyway - meaning that even those who don’t back the project will receive it, which surely disincentivizes people from backing the campaign. Sure, there will be official merchandise on offer, but does that mean that MangaGamer expects people to back the campaign for the merchandise alone? And perhaps they do, since the promised feature of ‘voice acting’ isn’t as simple as it sounds either. In fact, Umineko will be one of the few visual novels to receive a full English dub, which was previewed in the video below: When I heard this news, I immediately turned up my nose, but once I’d sat down and watched the full 20-minute dub preview, I couldn’t help but be pleasantly surprised. It seems like all of the voice cast are giving it their all, especially Kyle Ignezcki as Battler, who absolutely nails his emotional outburst towards the end. They’ve also shown themselves to be engaged with the project, with many of the voice actors interacting with the fan community on Twitter following the reveal. But to the dismay of many fans, it turned out that the English voice acting was the only form of voice acting going to be added with the Gold Edition - meaning that any hope of hearing the original Japanese voice cast, which includes the likes of Daisuke Ono as Battler and Sayaka Ohara as Beatrice, now lies with installing a fan-made proprietary patch, as it was not available in the base Steam version either. Why MangaGamer is not adding the Japanese voices in the Gold Edition has yet to be clarified, but it seems like they were able to circumvent the legal ramifications of using the PS3 sprites, which were created by Alchemist as part of their port of the original games to PS3. It was also during the PS3 ports that the game was dubbed in Japanese for the first time, meaning that MangaGamer would surely have been able to license the voice acting along with the sprites from Alchemist if they really wanted to. The fact that they didn’t is not only a missed opportunity, but downright perplexing. After all, fan demand for an English dub was pretty much non-existent before the Gold Edition’s announcement, so you have to wonder why the company would decide to funnel so much money and time into creating an entirely new English dub in the first place. The only answer I can think of is that MangaGamer are banking on the dub pushing Umineko into the mainstream, in which case they are in for a rude awakening. While visual novels, with their branching paths and interactive dialogue, have broken into the mainstream somewhat with such titles as Dangan Ronpa and Doki Doki Literature Club, Umineko is rather different from these typical visual novels. Not only does it lack interactivity altogether, but its subject matter is rather abstract and complicated, which may frustrate a mainstream player base. Umineko’s strength has always stemmed from its cult status, which in turn conditions a passionate and engaged player base - not from mass consumption. But as of the time of writing, the Kickstarter project for Gold Edition hasn’t even launched yet, so it’s possible that many of my grievances will be addressed when the project starts in earnest. And I must admit that despite my issues, I’m happy that Umineko is finally getting the attention it has always deserved.|Umineko, Umineko Gold Edition, Higurashi
14643|2018-11-07|16:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/comiket-2019-changes/| News | Anime | Comiket is Split Into Two Venues in 2019, May Add Entrance Fee | Guests are likely to face a radically different Comiket landscape in 2019 and 2020. |We previously reported on Comiket’s official status as remaining in Tokyo both immediately before and during the Olympics, but now we have a better idea of what the world’s largest comics marketplace and exhibition plans to do to alleviate some of the inconveniences that come with the move. So first, let’s start with a few facts. First, due to the Olympic takeover of the Tokyo Big Sight event hall where Comiket has been held for countless years now, the event is forced to utilize a temporary space being constructed away from the main hall. The bad news is that this extra space is located a full mile away at the Aomi Exhibition hall which, upon completion, will be located near Tokyo Teleport Station. Secondly, Comiket admission is usually free, but event-goers are encouraged to purchase an official catalog of all the doujin circles participating in order to aid them in navigating the massive labyrinth of booths. As you can probably tell, guests are likely to face a radically different Comiket landscape in 2019 and 2020. In order to alleviate the rise in cost from hosting the event in two separate locations, as well as the fall in profit likely to arise from fewer industry booths (regulated to the separate Aomi Hall), Comiket organizers have floated introducing an entrance fee for both 2019 events. It should be noted however that this fee would only apply to those who have not purchased a catalog, so it seems that tome would become a ticket in and of itself. After paying the fee, event-goers would receive a wristband allowing them to go between the two separate halls as they please. As mentioned though, these ideas are only being considered at this point; nothing is set in stone. I will go out on a limb though and say that it does seem to be a necessary evil, and anime and manga fans are going to have to put up with a bit of a different landscape for a couple of years. It remains to be seen exactly what will happen, but it will also be interesting if any changes could have a lasting effect on the way the event is run.|Comiket, Tokyo Olympics, Comic Market

In the case of this piece, I'm going to be talking about something you've probably seen discussed a million times before this, from people a million times more qualified to speak about it -- Nintendo's not so incredible online service, and the not so incredible bonuses. While logging into my PlayStation Plus subscription right now grants me instant access to two incredible titles, namely Yakuza Kiwami and Bulletstorm: Full Clip, those logging into Nintendo Switch Online this month will be offered up Mighty Bomb Jack, Twinbee, and the most noteworthy of the three, Metroid. Now, without discounting the incredible value that Metroid holds, it's a title that has already been made available numerous times and was even most recently made available to a massive player base via the Nintendo Entertainment System Classic. Right now Nintendo has shown no signs of moving past the NES era of games for consumers of their Online service, severely limiting the amount of content they can include that hasn't already been made available by recent hardware/software releases by Nintendo. There's only so many times people are going to want to re-purchase or re-subscribe for yet another copy of Super Mario Bros., or in this case, Metroid, and that's not a number that is necessarily going to increase any time soon. While I'm not surprised Nintendo isn't dropping the latest and greatest titles as free downloads for Nintendo Switch Online owners, it's a little disappointing that this is what your online subscription will earn you, especially when compared to the standards set by both PlayStation and Xbox. I have a lot of respect for my Nintendo Switch, and I know I'm going to be using it a lot over the next few months, but it sure would be nice to see Nintendo's online services and offerings improve, especially if they're looking to entice more users.

14638|2018-11-07|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/sota-fujimori-soundcloud-launch/| News | Music | Sota Fujimori Launches SoundCloud Account Full of Pure Synth Bliss | Sota Fujimori is bringing his personal synth works to the public |Sota Fujimori may be one of the most prolific names on the ever-growing roster of Bemani artists, but his online presence has always left a lot to be desired. For those outside of Japan, getting your hands on his music might not be easy. But whether or not you know him for his incredible "Synthesized" album releases, or even his in-game masterpieces on titles such as beatmania IIDX and Sound Voltex, there's no denying his musical quality -- oh, and his obsession with synthesizers. Previously die-hard fans looking to get a little more Sota Fujimori than what is made available publically would find themselves tracking down and adding him on Facebook, where he would often post videos of him toying around with traditional synthesizers and eurorack alike. With that being said, most of what was being shared was shorter videos. That all changed recently, however, with the launch of Sota Fujimori's official SoundCloud account, created in reaction to the numerous fake accounts on the platform. While it's a shame that he'd feel the need to create such an account in reaction to the numerous fakes, it's an exciting time for both pre-existing fans of Sota's work, as well as fans of synthesis as a whole. It's been shown time and time again over the years that he clearly knows what he's doing when put in front of a wall of modules, or even behind a 72-key keyboard. While there's only one track uploaded at the moment, simply titled "Rectangle", it'll be exciting to see what Sota Fujimori continues uploading from here on out. Those interested in checking out Sota Fujimori's recently launched SoundCloud, be sure the head over to it here.|Sota Fujimori, soundcloud, Bemani, beatmania

Enlisted as the menu music for the game, the bubbly electro-pop collaboration is equal parts Nakata and DAOKO and basically everything I would want from a collaboration between the two of them. While we knew the single would be appearing on DAOKO's third studio album, "Shiteki Ryoko", it was today confirmed that the song will be releasing on November 17, 2018. These last few years have been massive for DAOKO, following on from the astronomical success of her theme song for Fireworks it's been nothing but an uphill climb. That success has only continued over the past couple of months, especially with the recent release of Nintendo and Cygames' recent smartphone-exclusive title Dragalia Lost in which she is featured in prominently through the soundtrack. Calling on a veteran like Yasutaka Nakata, who is best known for his work with Capsule, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Perfume, as well as his massively expansive solo career, only comes across as a logical move. We've heard the in-game version time and time again, but on November 17 we'll finally be able to enjoy the full version of "Shiteki Ryoko". Until then, however, you can check out even more on DAOKO's upcoming album via her official website.|daoko, Yasutaka Nakata, Bokura no Network, DAOKO x Yasutaka Nakata, Dragalia Lost

Being a longtime fan of Yoshino's distinct sound, the past year has been an especially difficult one -- with only one remix released by the artist -- up until today.

They've been hosting a number of pop-up stores across Tokyo for some time now, but this week is set to see their biggest yet with the announcement that they'd be bringing their goods to the iconic Laforet HARAJUKU building from November 9 through until November 16, 2018. Taking place on the 2F of Laforet HARAJUKU in the Container Area, the pop-up will be running daily from 11:00 until 21:00, though the space will close at 19:00 on the final day. We've seen a number of tight new designs over these last couple of months, and there's no doubt they'll be making an appearance at the booth. This could be a huge opportunity for the brand, and with recent announcements that stores such as 2.5 SPINNS and PARK Harajuku would be carrying stock, they really do seem to be taking over. Originally founded by former Galaxxxy designer moji8fresh, it took no time at all for NUEZZZ to become a staple of my wardrobe. We'll definitely be making our way over to the pop-up to show our support, and I can't wait to check some of the more recent drops.

In light of this, global anime streaming service Crunchyroll released their quarterly report on what shows are performing best in what regions across the globe, with this season proving to be quite a one-sided one. While the report doesn't include long-running series such as Boruto and Black Clover, there was more than plenty of anime to be viewed -- though most chose to watch just one. Right now in the United States, there is an undeniable fever for Takaharu Ozaki's ongoing adaptation of Goblin Slayer -- an extreme new addition to the ever-growing Fantasy genre that took most of the international anime community by storm. This isn't the first time Crunchyroll has seen a singular series take over the entirety of the United States, and it probably won't be the last, but it just goes to show how much people want something a little on the more extreme side, all while providing a captivating story. It's a similar story for my home country of Australia, where all states and territories are completely captivated by the series. With a number of top-performers seeing representation this season, including the latest JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind and Sword Art Online, it really goes to say a lot about the series. In other parts of the world, however, we're seeing a bit more of a broader image painted, especially in Europe and Latin America where we're seeing some of the most diverse rankings. Fittingly enough, Europe is giving some massive support to the ongoing JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind which finds itself situated within the confines of Italy. It's definitely an interesting time for anime, especially with a series like Goblin Slayer seemingly coming out of nowhere and taking on some of the previous watchdogs and coming out on top. With plenty more fun little bits of trivia and information in the full quarterly report from Crunchyroll, you'll definitely want to check it out on their official website.|Crunchyroll, Goblin Slayer, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Sword Art Online

While series creator Suda51 was relatively quiet for some time regarding whether or not the game would be receiving a physical release, recent postings by Gamestop would suggest that the game will be released physically -- at least in the United States -- on Nintendo Switch. Oh, and we got our latest look at the title with this: Revealed via Grasshopper Manufacture's official English Twitter account, the new visual highlights a few familiar and unfamiliar faces that'll be playing various roles in the upcoming spin-off title. Funilly enough, however, one of the most common responses to the new visual isn't necessarily just excitement for the game -- but rather, people requesting/demanding that they put Travis Touchdown in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Still on track for a January 18, 2019 release, the upcoming Nintendo Switch exclusive is definitely one to look forward to. Depending on the success, we might even just get a third mainline entry into the No More Heroes series, so there's that to look forward to as well.

14627|2018-11-05|18:00||http://otaquest.com/monogatari-song-streaming/| News | Anime , Music | Over 300 ‘Monogatari’ Songs Added to Online Streaming Services | Over three-hundred songs from the legendary 'Monogatari' series have been added to most major digital streaming services. |It’s no secret that the Monogatari series has some of the best anisong around. Not only have songs such as “Platinum Disco” and “Renai Circulation” transcended the series to become full-blown musical memes, but the series has openly embraced this aspect of itself, changing its opening and (sometimes) endings songs regularly to let fans hear more musical goodness. Up until now, these songs were locked behind physical releases only, which proves difficult for those who wish to collect all the songs, as well those living outside of Japan. Good news then, that Aniplex has now decided to put all of the series’ music - yes, all of it - on streaming services and digital download stores. Thanks to the series’ constant chopping and changing of music, the number of songs going to become available on streaming and digital download services is a staggering 306 - which encompasses everything from opening and ending songs, to character songs and even original soundtracks. The theme song for the newly released Monogatari Pukupuku mobile game, “wicked prince,” will be available as well, meaning that the collection will truly be completely up to date. Check out the participating services below: Streaming Apple Music, KK BOX, AWA, LINE MUSIC, Google Play Music, レコチョクBEST, ひかりTVミュージック, dミュージック, Rakuten Music, Spotify, Amazon Music Unlimited, dヒッツ, うたパス Digital download iTunes store, レコチョク, mora, music.jp. Google Play, Amazon Music, LINE MUSIC, ドワンゴジェイピー, ヤマハ Mysound, TSUTAYA ミュージコ, オリコンデジタルミュージック, mu-mo, KONAMI MUSIC Western fans of the series should be very happy at this news, as the inclusion of Spotify and iTunes in the list means that we’ll have a chance to listen to them as well. It’s definitely not common for Japanese music to be available to stream on in particular Spotify, so for that Aniplex have gone out of their way to facilitate Western fans in a sense. With this great news, I know what my soundtrack for the next couple of months is set to be. And what a great time to do so as well, with the series set to conclude in the theatrical film Zokuowarimonogatari this month.|Monogatari, itunes, Spotify, Apple Music, Soundtrack

Set to release on November 16 and November 30 respectively, the albums see a number of TeddyLoid's greatest hits locked and reloaded with a handful of originals mixed in, including an all-new track featuring Virtual Riot, "Guardians of the Universe" that has been teased for quite some time now. With an all-around killer lineup of both returning titles and album exclusives, both RELOADED and INFINITY are definitely going to be the definitive TeddyLoid albums, and an incredible accumulation of the last three years for the artist. While many English-speaking fans know Teddy best for his works on both Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt in 2010 and ME!ME!ME! in 2014, his songs have long been festival staples including the massive "Game Changers" with Yasutaka Nakata and "All You Ever Need" with Taku Takahashi. Both albums' tracklists can be seen below: SILENT PLANET: RELOADED November 16, 2018 NKCD-6849 ¥2,800 + Tax Reloaded (Intro) Guardians of the Universe feat. Virtual Riot Bring It Back feat.

We're seeing a number of incredible artists featured on both albums, quite a recurring trend for TeddyLoid, and can't wait to check out the release when they both drop. Until then, those wanting to check out additional information be sure to check out TeddyLoid's official website.|TeddyLoid, SILENT PLANET

Would be getting a film project, I nearly keeled over out of pure joy. Upon seeing this news begin to develop from yesterday, however, it started to dawn on me just how long we’ve gone without any official updates. The reason for that being the case, however, is likely because I was just enjoying the light novels and various spinoffs that author Natsume Akatsuki has been writing. As this news finally comes out, it all makes perfect sense -- perhaps the most popular character takes front-and-center in the new visual. That’s right, it looks like Megumin will be taking the lead as the visual and title of the movie, KonoSuba - God’s blessing on this wonderful world! Crimson Legend, seems to imply. Anyone who has watched the series knows Megumin’s affinity towards the color and her spinoff light novels remain popular sellers. The whole cast and key staff will be returning to reprise their roles in the new project, with one surprising change -- the movie will be animated and produced by studio J.C. Staff, rather than Studio DEEN from the two seasons of the TV show. It’s still on track for a theatrical release sometime next year. Another surprise announcement was the confirmation of a new game in development for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. It’s currently without a subtitle in its name, but series theme song regular Machico will perform ‘Stand Up! For the first-person dungeon crawling adventure. This game already follows a visual-novel style adventure, and I’ll definitely be happy to get more in the way of official character art! Peek the teaser trailer and visual below! I’m happy these updates have finally been revealed, and am looking forward to a whole lot more KonoSuba goodness to explode onto the scene next year! If you haven't given the series a try yet, the anime is a perfect way to start. Rarely have I seen a slapstick comedy that is so on the mark with its timing, as well as taking full advantage of the quirky personalities of its main characters. Yen Press is also currently releasing the light novels in North America, and you can find their official synopsis below. Game loving shut-in Kazuma Sato's life as a young schoolboy in Japan abruptly comes to an early end...or at least it was supposed to. When he opens his eyes, though, he sees a beautiful goddess that offers him a once in an after-lifetime chance to be reborn in a parallel world. The catch is that the world is violent and threatened by a growing evil! Fortunately, he can choose any one thing to bring with him. So he chooses the goddess, Aqua! And so his adventure with his gorgeous companion begins--if he could just get enough money and food to survive, keep his goddess out of trouble, and avoid grabbing the attention of the Demon King's army!

14626|2018-11-05|15:00||http://otaquest.com/hideaki-anno-beer-cm/| News | Anime | Hideaki Anno Kicks Back With a Beer in New Commercial | Hideaki Anno made a quick appearance in the latest commercial for Sapporo's new black label beer to discuss mind, soul, and body. |Hideaki Anno has been known to come up with some pretty meaningful insights into the human condition over his career. To say nothing of his seminal 1995 masterpiece Neon Genesis Evangelion, even his Shin Godzilla film was pretty meaningful for a kaiju flick, criticizing Japanese governmental bureaucracy as well as the latent conservatism within. Perhaps it’s for that reason, then, that he has been chosen to be the latest star in a series of commercials titled “Otona Elevator” for the Japanese beer label Sapporo, in which actor and musician Tsumabuki Satoshi talks to various different people of different ages about life, all while enjoying an ice-cold beer. Check out the full version of the commercial below: Even without understanding the Japanese, it’s clear that Anno has put a lot of thought into these answers from his body language and cadence alone, but when translated these answers are a pretty good insight into Anno’s psyche. Firstly, when asked what is “youth,” he replies with “something that’s over before you know it.” Next, when asked what is “life,” he says “something like the tracks of a wheel... footsteps if you will.” When asked what is “art,” he defines it as “something only humans can do.” Finally, when asked what is “amusement,” he posits that it’s “something you don’t really need, but if you didn’t have it, you wouldn’t be able to go on.” The answers Anno gives really highlight how much the director has grown since his younger days directing Kare Kano and Evangelion, back when he was struggling with very serious problems with depression and the enigmatic conundrum of how to connect with others. Since then, however, Anno’s life has gotten much better, no doubt thanks to his commercial success, but also his successful marriage with manga artist Moyoco Anno in 2002 - which has all contributed to him becoming the mature, thoughtful artist he is today. Shorter 15-second and 30-second versions of the commercials are set to broadcast on satellite television nationwide starting November 3. If you’re in Japan, keep an eye out for them - and perhaps enjoy an ice-cold beer while you’re at it.|Hideaki Anno, Evangelion, Neon Genesis Evangelion

Both helming from Japan's more obscure alternative-pop scenes, the production of WEDNESDAY CAMPANELLA and KOM_I's hazy vocals layer effortlessly over yahyel's signature down-tempo sound creating the foundation for what would otherwise be the sound of my dreams: Made available earlier this week, "Survive Tokyo." is one of those extremely rare cases where a collaboration really pulls off representing both artist's sounds without compromise. What'll be most interesting is, when the song inevitably receives a music video, whether the video will feature WEDNESDAY CAMPANELLA music video director Dir. F, or yahyel's own video director ​Kento Yamada, both of whom have an extremely unique and iconic video style. Perhaps the best case scenario would see the two team up to share ideas, ultimately resulting in the best of both worlds once more.

We've seen snippets in previous trailers, but this is the first time we actually get to see heroes Sora, Donald, and Goofy encounter both Flynn and Rapunzel as they fight back hoards of heartless with a number of new mechanics. With Kingdom Hearts III finally starting to feel like a reality, boasting that rapidly-approaching January 29, 2019 release date, getting excited about trailers and videos finally doesn't feel like a sin. That's especially good news here, with the latest trailer oozing all sorts of fun-filled moments that perfectly capture the energy that only the sheer ridiculousness of a Kingdom Hearts title could capture. It was only a month ago that we were graced with the TGS 2018 trailer featuring Big Hero 6, so it'll be interesting to see if we see any more footage before the game actually releases. Set to be available on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III has been years in the making. With just a few more months standing between us and its release, it'll be interesting to see just how fans across the globe receive it, especially after all this time.

Shared over the weekend, the hour-long mix hits all of the right spots, filled to the brim with originals and remixes that encompass everything great about Yunomi. Whether you know him for his original works or his production for idol groups such as CY8ER and Happy Kuru Kuru, Yunomi's signature sound shines in this mix: While the last year has been relatively quiet on the front of personal releases from Yunomi, we've seen a number of incredible collaborations with talents such as KOTONOHOUSE and TORIENA, including the recently released "Time Capsule" from TORIENA's latest album. Consistently one of my favorite talents from Japan since he first came onto the scene in 2015, the growth of Yunomi over the years has been nothing short of incredible. Whether it's in the club or on the wired, there's nothing that compares to a Yunomi mix, and I can't wait to see the "Yunomix" series expanded upon -- hopefully it doesn't take another two years though. Those interested in checking out even more from Yunomi, be sure to take some time to visit his official website.|Yunomi, Yunomix, remix, youtube, Mixtape
14608|2018-11-02|21:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/honest-boyz-pharrell-tokyo-dip/| News | Music | HONEST BOYZ® Team Up With PHARRELL WILLIAMS For YouTube Exclusive Single, TOKYO DIP | HONEST BOYZ® teams up with 11 time grammy winner PHARRELL WILLIAMS for their latest single, available exclusively on YouTube with a video directed by NIGO. |The superstar hip-hop group HONEST BOYZ® have teamed up with PHARRELL WILLIAMS for their newest single, TOKYO DIP (feat. PHARRELL WILLIAMS). For those familiar with the group, the connection to PHARRELL may not come as much of a surprise, HONEST BOYZ® members VERBAL (PKCZ ®/m-flo) and NIGO® have both worked with him in the past and the former is a longtime collaborator. Regardless, having him appear as both producer and vocalist has resulted in an infectious new track which you're sure to be humming for days. For those unfamiliar with HONEST BOYZ®, the group is a who's who of talent associated with different acts within the Japanese powerhouse entertainment company, LDH. Members of the group include NAOTO (EXILE / J-Soul Brothers III) who acts as leader, VERBAL (m-flo / PKCZ®), SWAY (DOBERMAN INFINITY), MANDY (GENERATIONS), and NIGO®. Individually each member is a part of a larger group that has seen massive success in Japan. It's a collection of highly talented and creative artists & entertainers coming together for the type of project that you don't often see in the modern music landscape. The song opens up with the chorus, sung by PHARRELL, and immediately sets the tone for the rest of the track. It's a mellow, feel-good sound that has a smooth cadence from start to finish, and allows each member of the group to really shine in their individual verses. Overall the lyrics carry the theme of trying to find love in different scenarios, with each member discussing particular misfortunes & mindsets. The style of the video (directed by NIGO®) represents the sound perfectly as well, with various locations around Shibuya & Nakameguro making up the backdrop throughout. Each member of the group delivers their verses while participating in the kind of activities you would see every day in downtown Tokyo, with a genuine feel of what it's like to take a stroll on a warm relaxing day in the metropolis. Just ahead of writing this article we received a message from HBZ leader NAOTO about the track: As a member of HONEST BOYZ®, I’m excited to have had the opportunity to collaborate with PHARRELL WILLIAMS, the worldwide recognized artist! I am looking forward to people being able to enjoy PHARRELL’S addictive track and the smooth lyrics from HBZ!! Aside from the obvious statement about the collaboration itself, what really makes this track so remarkable is the way that it's being distributed. Rather than being available for sale or streaming through the standard digital music outlets, TOKYO DIP is available exclusively on YouTube. At least until HONEST BOYZ®'s debut album comes out in spring of 2019. Japanese labels & music distributors are famously closed off from YouTube as a music partner, so seeing a video & song of this caliber come out of Japan is an incredibly fresh idea to take in. Here's hoping this is just the beginning in a long line of tracks & videos from Japan that become fully available on Youtube. In the meantime, we'll keep bobbing our head to this track while anticipating HONEST BOYZ® next release!|HONEST BOYZ, pharrell williams, NIGO, TOKYO DIP, youtube, Exclusive
14616|2018-11-02|17:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/ssss-gridman-doujin/| News | Anime | 'SSSS.Gridman''s Producer Tsuburaya Joins a Small List of Companies Disallowing Doujin Works of Property | The Japanese anime fandom seemed to be all about fan participation and creation, but could that be changing? |Among those Japanese words that have become quite ubiquitous amongst devoted anime fans, "doujin" and "doujinshi" have to be near the top of the list. They are terms encompassing any number and type of derivative fan work, whether it be art, music, games, or even full-blown comics -- to which that latter term applies. Now, there may be a variety of concerns when it comes to fan works -- under the usual Western way of approaching media, it may even seem absurd the degree to which derivative works can be produced, bought, and sold. We're talking of course about works that have the big bad trademark symbol plastered across them, but in Japan this has in a way been seen as a form of free marketing. In most cases involving media that we are familiar with as well, it stands to reason that a corporation wouldn't necessarily be down with major representations of their works and characters being of the, shall we say, salacious sort. Anime's different though -- Comiket has been going strong for over 40 years now, and the place is absolutely spattered with the goods. It seemed that this sacred balance of official ignorance would continue well into the future, but a few high-key properties have come out to say "No lewds (or other neat fan-things) allowed!" These include the Love Live! franchise, for which the rights holders stated that doujin merch would be dealt with in an official capacity, all while urging fans to only support the official source financially. It's unclear as to whether they were including doujinshi under the umbrella, and if they ever tried to prosecute the production and sale of such, but I certainly haven't seen any decline in the stuff since last year! Another similarily large property to "ban" the production of doujin merch was Girls und Panzer. But again, that order was unclear when it came to doujinshi comics. This time, it could be different. Enter Tsuburaya -- the production agency and right-holder to a number of popular tokusatsu shows, including the legendary Ultraman. It just so happens that they are also the major stakeholder in one of this anime season's biggest hits, SSSS.Gridman. If you ever frequent pixiv, or heck, even Twitter, then you know that folks have certainly taken an uh, liking, to two of the shows main characters -- Rikka and Akane. While the fanart doesn't seem to be affected by a new stance the company is taking towards derivative works, it does seem that if Tsuburaya has its way, then you won't be seeing full-blown doujinshi at Comiket this year, or any year for that matter. It's all laid out in the fourth FAQ question listed on this page of the company's site. So there you have it. I can't help but wonder what this means in the larger context of a fandom tradition almost as old as the industry itself. Now that a major production has publicly come out to ban these types of works, will others be so emboldened? It's difficult to sit here and say with any kind of authority that companies shouldn't take this kind of approach; after all, copyright laws do exist and these things are the official property of their creators, but it would just be so odd. Considering that doujin culture is such a large part of anime fandom, I don't see huge swaths of it going anywhere anytime soon -- that free advertising thing would be pretty hard to beat in my books. But it may just come to pass that certain companies, in some effort to appear more "family-friendly" or even just more savvy of their properties and rights, may just choose to pull a bit of rug out from underneath some fan's feet. I'm sure fans will find a way though. They usually do, and the interent is a vast, scary place.|SSSS.GRIDMAN, Doujin, doujinshi, Tsuburaya
14613|2018-11-02|16:00||http://otaquest.com/konami-pt-dead/| News | Games | Is Konami Finally Killing Hideo Kojima’s ‘P.T.’? | Is Konami finally killing Hideo Kojima's longtime project PT, the precursor to the Silent Hills game that never came to light? |The story of P.T. (Playable Teaser) is a strange one indeed. Not only was it a meeting of three frankly incredible minds - that of Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro, and Junji Ito - it was set to revive the fan favorite franchise Silent Hill, which has languished in stark mediocrity in recent years compared to its innovative roots. So strange then, that Konami decided to cancel the project (presumably because of Kojima’s exit from Konami after the completion of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain in 2015) but continue to leave the franchise as a whole stagnant, despite incredibly positive critical and fan reception of the playable teaser. But as if it that wasn’t enough suffering for those who were excited about the possibilities P.T. might offer, some strange and disturbing news began to float around Reddit about a supposed update that rendered P.T. unplayable. The issue was first raised on the Silent Hill subreddit by user “PopulusTrichocarpa”, where they claimed that a recent update for the game - on the date of October 22 - had made it so that they could not play it. Many users responded that they had the same problem, and some users even claimed that their copy of PT stopped working months ago - only further confounding the mystery. From this many drew the conclusion that Konami was pushing an update that killed the game, which wouldn’t be unusual considering that the company had already removed it from the PlayStation Store a while back, meaning that only those who downloaded the game during the short time it was available could ever play it. Yet, as a recent post by user “Midnightapalooza” pointed out, the post history of the original poster is rather suspicious, only containing three posts, with one of them being a bizarre string of numbers. It seems like the account is a throwaway, which only further threw the news into suspicion. Furthermore, as Midnightapalooza pointed out, any attempt to lock the game would not come through an update, but would simply be a case of “flicking a switch” server-side - making the possibility that an update nuke the game seem very unlikely indeed. The comments on this post also seem to be dominated by users saying that their copy P.T. is still playable, which only seems to contradict the posts in the Silent Hill subreddit. I wasn’t able to confirm if this was the case myself, as I missed the boat on P.T. back when it was available, so the mystery remains unsolved for me. Konami has yet to provide a statement on the issue, so we’re still very much in the dark on this issue, but what’s even scarier than the possibility of P.T. being nuked, however, is the fact that fans seriously believe that Konami would even do such a thing - just showing how much disdain there is towards the company amongst fans. But even though the game might not be dead just yet, be careful if you’re planning to give PT a shot anyway, especially during these spooky months of Winter. Be sure to turn off auto-updates to the system in the first instance, then back up the files of the game on an external hard drive to only be used when the system is offline to avoid any game-nuking update badness. Konami may have taken Silent Hills away from us, but they shall not take away P.T.|Konami, PT, Silent Hills, Hideo Kojima

Ultimate had its final direct last night, and with it an essential amount of information shared about fighters, modes, and story. |With the upcoming Super Smash Bros. Ultimate just around the corner, this week marked the final Nintendo Direct that the game would be receiving, and with it, the revelation of a pretty substantial amount of much-needed information for the title. With hype continuing to mount around the Nintendo Switch exclusive title, as well as a substantial amount of untruthful leaks and rumors, the reception of the Direct was mixed, but if anything, there's absolutely a whole lot of reasons to get excited. First and foremost, we now have a complete roster of on-launch fighters for the title, with the announcement that Ken from Street Fighter, Incineroar from Pokémon, and Piranha Plant from Super Mario Bros. In addition to this, Nintendo announced that we'll be seeing the addition of five more fighters at later dates through DLC, though even director Masahiro Sakurai doesn't seem to know who those five will be given the already 74 fighter strong lineup. Following on from this, we now have confirmation of the game's burgeoning campaign mode, "World of Light", which looks to add something completely new to the Super Smash Bros. series. The announcement and reveal for this mode, in particular, had me completely in awe, and I can't wait to see how it plays out. It also proves that Sakurai is still very much a loving father towards Kirby and that he'd never let harm come to such an adorable child. Lastly, we had a number of different systems and modes broken down for us, including the game's new spirit system that will have players collecting various spirits after fights as a replacement to the previous trophy system. Set to be released worldwide on December 7, 2018, I can't wait to get my hands on the upcoming Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and see what the title has to offer, already positioning itself as the most expansive release in the history of the franchise.

While the Summertime might finally be over in Japan (thank god for that), that doesn't mean we can't keep a bit of that heat alive, and thankfully German trackmaker Android52 is here to keep us moving with his hyperactive electro remix of "Digital Tattoo". Uploaded to Android52's SoundCloud earlier this week, the remix flawlessly blends both the original sounds of Tokyo's club music scene with a heavy-hitting German electro influence. Though he came onto the scene both in Japan and internationally with his eclectic anime song flips that he so heavily identified with, we're seeing a much more original style come into play over these last few months, and I'm completely in love with this direction. Having been a long time fan of his sounds, this natural progression is more than welcome, and this remix of "Digital Tattoo" is a perfect example of what he's capable of. Though I thought I was about done hearing "Digital Tattoo" being played out at club events, I can already picture myself going as hard as ever to this remix at any given Shibuya event. The remix is available as a free download via Android52's SoundCloud account and joins the evergrowing roster of remixes from talents such as Snail's House, KOTONOHOUSE, and more. |Android52, LADY'S ONLY, Digital Tattoo

It's shaping up to be an adorable multiplayer experience that'll likely be best enjoyed with friends, and I'm pretty down for that -- it's what I use my Nintendo Switch for most, after all. During last nights Nintendo Treehouse livestream, we got yet another look at the upcoming title, showcasing just under thirty minutes of both single player and multiplayer action. While we don't have a definitive release date for Yoshi's Crafted World just yet, the game is currently slated to be released during Spring 2019 which certainly gives us something to look forward to. Taking place in a world crafted entirely of various real-world items, from straws to plates and paddle pops, the game expands open the DIY concept of Yoshi's Wooly World and takes it to adorable new heights. Gameplay is simple, and likely won't provide much of a challenge, but if you're looking for a cute wind-me-down this might be just the game for you. I'm sure we'll be seeing even more gameplay footage and trailers before the game actually releases in Spring 2019, so we'll be sure to keep you up to date when those drop.

Looking into the Lavender Town trailer first off, The Pokémon Company have done an incredible job capturing the mood of everything fans have ever loved about the area, and that tune still sends shivers down my spine. Lavender Town has always been one of the more surreal parts of the Pokémon experience, filled to the brim with history and lore that would more often than not go over the heads of the younger audience -- all while still providing an undeniable air of fear. The trailer features both Pikachu and Eevee expressing an extreme disdain for the location, presumably knowing about the building being the burial ground for hundreds of deceased Pokémon. Turning over onto a more positive note, we got a fresh look at some actual gameplay for the titles last night during the latest Nintendo Treehouse, where we saw trainers fighting Team Rocket, capturing Meltan, and even partaking in battles. Running for about 40 minutes in duration, the footage for that can be seen below: Set to release exclusively on Nintendo Switch on November 16, 2018, both Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! are shaping up to be a genuinely enjoyable experience, even if it's not a hardcore mainline adventure like many people originally viewed them to be.

So if you really want that iconic Lord Slug set, you’ll need to go for repeat viewings - something I’m sure die-hard fans won’t mind doing. Check out the sticker designs below: Not limited to only inside the movie theatre, however, the fun and anticipation for Broly is coming to train stations in the Kansai region, with a new stamp rally set to begin on November 1 to December 14. Those who visit all seven of the stations and fill out their stamp sheet will receive stickers (not the ones given out in the theatre, mind you) as well a clear file. So not only do you get to experience the joy of using the wonderful Japanese railway system, you get to pick up some sweet Dragon Ball merch as well - sounds good to me. If you’re in the Kansai area, then definitely check out the official website for more information on the participating stations, here. With the December 14 release date for the movie drawing ever closer, there’s no doubt that the anticipation is reaching an all-time high. Not just in Japan either - Western fans are eagerly awaiting the cinematic release of the movie by Funimation, scheduled to take place on January 16, 2019. |Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball Broly, Dragon Ball Z, Broly, Akira Toriyama

Even original creator Monkey Punch can’t seem to contain his excitement, as he has drawn a special commemorative illustration of Lupin for the ride’s opening - the first time in a long time since he has last picked up the pencil. Check it out below: The illustration takes the form of one of Lupin’s famous “Letter of Challenge” that he likes to send to his victims in order to make things a little bit tougher for himself. The illustration proclaims that “A letter of challenge from Lupin III has been delivered here, to Universal Studios Japan,” and features a cackling Lupin in the bottom right corner who taunts “Can you escape from my trap?” It’s a nice piece of promotional material for the upcoming ride, which is set to open on January 18, 2019, but it’s also going to be used within the park itself as a real “letter of challenge” plastered on the park’s walls, taunting park goers to come and give the new ride a go. Universal Studios Japan always tends to theme their parks well around new attractions, so I have no doubt that this illustration will form a key part of internal theming. Even if you’re not planning to go and give the new Lupin ride a go, it’s still incredible that Monkey Punch is still a great illustrator after all these years. The legendary creator is over 80 years old at this point, and his Lupin has the same expressiveness that he did when he first came on the scene, all the way back in 1967. What’s more, he hasn’t even drawn Lupin since the 1977 manga Lupin the Third - World’s Most Wanted, save for a couple of special occasions. With this year looking to come to a close very soon, my excitement for the new Lupin the Third ride is reaching a new peak. Even Monkey Punch himself says, in a comment attached to the illustration that he is “looking forward to the ride” - but the question remains, will he be giving it a go?|Monkey Punch, Lupin the Third, Lupin III, Lupin the 3rd, USJ, Universal Studios Japan

This week, we're not only seeing this promise come to life, but we're also seeing the announcement of just how these next few weeks are going to play out for what might just be one of the most interesting musical projects of the year. First things first, however, let's take a look at Kizuna AI's latest single "new world" as produced once again by Yunomi. Unlike the previously produced single from Yunomi, we see a much more up-tempo presentation and approach on "new world". It's still very much a Yunomi-produced song, but that's definitely a statement with value -- and I'm sure it's also something that Kizuna AI had in mind when working with him. It might not be as much of a club-ready banger as "Hello, Morning", but it's definitely got just the right balance of energy and excitement to get you moving. When the first single in this project originally dropped, Kizuna AI detailed that we could expect nine weeks of releases before finally reaching the Virtual YouTuber's first ever live show in both Tokyo and Osaka at the end of the year. Though we knew Yunomi would be producing the first two weeks of content, it remained uncertain as to who the other featured producers would be -- until now. Calling on the respective talents of Avec Avec, Nor, Pa's Lam System, TeddyLoid, Taku Takahashi, MATZ, and DE DE MOUSE, there's absolutely a whole lot you should be looking forward to. With two weeks down and seven to go, we'll definitely want to be keeping our eyes on Kizuna AI as she continues her quest for global entertainment domination. Until then, however, you can keep up to date with everything Kizuna AI via her official website.|Kizuna Ai, Yunomi, New World, Kizuna AI New World, taku takahashi, DE DE MOUSE, Pa's Lam System, NOR, Avec Avec, TeddyLoid, MATZ

Perhaps most importantly of all the things happening before then, Yumemi Nemu's upcoming debut solo album "Yumemi Jidai" which releases on November 21, 2018, has a few of us around the office pretty excited -- especially after today's revelations. Announced today via Yumemi Nemu's various SNS accounts, we not only now have the full tracklisting for both the standard and limited edition variants of the album, but also the incredible talents producing the songs. First of all, we're seeing a lot of already existing tracks from Nemu including the incredible "Cosmic Melon Soda Magic Love", a personal favorite and something near impossible to purchase on physical media without forking out a few hundred dollars. Only adding to the excitement, we're seeing artists such as tofubeats and MOSAIC.WAV producing new sounds to highlight Nemu's talents. 01. 魔法少女未満 ［作詞：夢眠ねむ・CHEEBOW / 作曲・編曲：CHEEBOW］ 02. ユメミる惑星 ［作詞：米山玩具 / 作曲・編曲：小池雅也］ 03. コズミックメロンソーダマジックラブ ［作詞：夢眠ねむ・PandaBoY / 作曲・編曲：PandaBoY］ 04. あのね…実はわたし、夢眠ねむなんだ…▽ ［作詞・作曲・編曲：清竜人］ 05. あるいは夢眠ねむという概念へのサクシード ［作詞・作曲・編曲：MOSAIC.WAV］ 06. ナイフ ［作詞・作曲・編曲：渡辺健二］ 07. あたしの最後のラブソング ［作詞・作曲：坂口喜咲 / 編曲：大久保友裕］ 08. おやすみ世界きゅん。 ［作詞・作曲・編曲：tofubeats］ 09. 蛍の光（PandaBoY REMIX feat.夢眠ねむ）2018 ［作詞・作曲・編曲：PandaBoY］ 10. 魔法少女未満2018 ［作詞：夢眠ねむ・CHEEBOW / 作曲・編曲：CHEEBOW］ Set to release nationwide in Japan on November 21, I can't wait to get my hands on what might just be Yumemi Nemu's final piece of solo media. With the final Dempagumi.inc album featuring Nemu, "WareWare wa Dempagumi.inc da", set to release on January 1, 2019, I'll certainly be cherishing everything I can get my hands on, while I still can.

They're one of the most noteworthy idol groups out there right now, and that's a trend that isn't looking to change anytime soon -- especially with these last few releases. Uploaded to CY8ER's official YouTube channel earlier this week, the group began streaming the latest live video from their August 2 show at Shinkiba COAST, this time to the tune of "Guru Guru Continue". Released just in time for Halloween here in Japan, the live video gives fan just a small sample of what's to come at CY8ER's upcoming one-man live event at Roppongi EX Theater on December 26, 2018. With all five members of CY8ER performing on stage, while group producer Yunomi is up back DJ'ing, it's pretty easy to see why the crowd are going so hard. I'm not too sure how well I'd fare at an idol live show, but damn, I'd love to check them out. Though we're still yet to see "Guru Guru Continue" receive an official release outside of the live video, it'll be exciting to see just what they've got in the works, and how we'll be seeing this track eventually get released. With a busy live schedule on top of a relatively frequent release schedule, I'm excited to see how CY8ER pushes forward into 2019.

Following the release of Nintendo's latest financial reports earlier this week, it was revealed that the Nintendo Switch has officially surpassed the Gamecube's lifetime sales by over 1.12 million units; the Nintendo Switch currently sits at a lifetime sales update of 22.86 million units, while the Gamecube capped off at 21.74 million. There's been little doubt to the success of the Nintendo Switch, especially in comparison to Nintendo's previous venture the Wii U, but Nintendo will be relying on the success of the Holiday Season quite heavily should they wish to reach their yearly goal. With the upcoming release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, we're sure to see a few more units moved, but there's certainly going to need to be more at play to reach the 20 million units sold this year. Personally, I've been noticing that I've been playing the Switch a little less for personal enjoyment, though it continues to remain a staple whenever guests come over. Titles such as Mario Party are of course a great addition to that party atmosphere, but I can only hope that I'll begin finding more games that create a similar single player experience. There are a few games on the horizon that have me excited, and I can't wait to give those titles a go, and I'm sure you'll see me talking about them when they do come out -- but until then, let's see how the Switch continues to do over the Holidays.|Nintendo Switch, Switch, Nintendo, Gamecube

Easily one of my favorite games to play on the Nintendo Switch, the news that the title coming to the West shouldn't surprise too many -- but it's always nice to have it detailed, especially given how long it's been with no official announcement from Square Enix. Listed in the earning report under the "Launch Schedule of Primary Nintendo Products by Region (extracts: Oct. 2018~)" header, the upcoming Dragon Quest Builders 2 is listed alongside titles such as Animal Crossing for Nintendo Switch, Luigi's Mansion 3, and DAEMON X MACHINA for a 2019 release. While this does only technically confirm the title for a Western release on Nintendo Switch, it'd be unlikely that the game wouldn't also receive a PlayStation 4 release much like its predecessor and the game's release in Japan. Set to release in Japan on December 20, 2018, the upcoming sequel to the 2016 sandbox RPG title Dragon Quest Builders will be made available on both Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

Announced earlier this week, we're seeing Hello Kitty, Bad Badtz-Maru, Cinnamon Roll, and more collide once more with the visual aesthetics of Splatoon 2, as well as Off the Hook, in what's undoubtedly going to be another fast-selling release, this time made available at over twenty Kiddy Land locations across Japan. Set to be released on November 12 and made available until November 22 at Kiddy Land locations across Japan, it turns out I've lucked out once again with the goods set to be made available two-days earlier at Sanrio Puroland on November 10. While most characters will be receiving some sort of recognition in the collaboration, the second wave introduces Pochacco, Badtz-Maru, Tuxedo Sam and Keroppi, all who received minor parts in the last wave of goods. While the collaboration includes a number of items, I'm sure a few members of the OTAQUEST staff are going to be gunning in particular for the Bad Badtz-Maru shirt and charm, which I've got a bad feeling I'm going to be made to wait in line for on November 10 at Sanrio Puroland. All of the goods are limited-edition and will only be made available during the event time from November 10 until November 22, so you'll definitely want to make your way down to either Sanrio Puroland or Kiddy Land before stock runs out.

In addition to the announcement, the group also shared the dates and locations of the North America and Asia legs of the tour, some of which Perfume has never performed at before. The all-capitalization returns once more for the tour, which is officially being titled 'Perfume WORLD TOUR 4th “FUTURE POP”'. Perfume WORLD TOUR 4th “FUTURE POP” 2019/3/2 @ NTU Sports Center / Taipei, TAIWAN 2019/3/30 @ HAMMERSTEIN BALLROOM / New York, NY 2019/4/2 @ QUEEN ELIZABETH THEATRE / Toronto, ON 2019/4/5 @ CHICAGO THEATRE / Chicago, IL 2019/4/7 @ THE BOMB FACTORY / Dallas, TX 2019/4/10 @ PARAMOUNT THEATRE / Seattle, WA 2019/4/17 @ CITY NATIONAL CIVIC / San Jose, CA 2019/4/19 @ ACE THEATRE / Los Angeles, CA *Details for Shanghai concert TBA. *All dates are local time.

Coinciding with the announcement of Perfume's upcoming world tour, the trio has additionally seen their international website undergo a complete redesign to showcase their activities over the past few years. Over on Moshi Moshi Nippon, Perfume had the following to say about their upcoming tour: “We’re so excited to announce our first world tour in 2 years! This is going to be our biggest world tour ever, including some cities we’re playing for the first time. Our latest album “Future Pop” became No.1 electronic album in 20 countries. We will mainly be performing off of this album and will put out the coolest shows we can for our international fans. Can’t wait to see you all at the show” If you've been following my activity lately, it should be no secret at all that I've been spending all my time listening to Perfume's latest studio album "Future Pop" both at work and while out and about. That's not without good reason either, with the entire album screaming everything I'd want from the group and more. While its one thing to see the group live in Japan during their tour, I can only imagine the energy of fans across the globe that would fill the room as they perform.

14583|2018-10-30|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/playstation-classic-lineup/| News | Games | PlayStation Classic Game Lineup Revealed | Sony revealed the full twenty-title lineup for both the North American and Japanese releases of the upcoming PlayStation Classic earlier this week. |Earlier this week Sony announced the entire 20-title lineup for their upcoming PlayStation Classic mini-console ahead of its December 3, 2018, release date. Met with little surprise, we're seeing a slightly different roster from both the Japanese and international releases, with the former focusing more on traditional popular RPG titles of the time while the latter focuses on action titles. We're seeing titles such as Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil, and Persona appear on both console releases, however, with the full lineup available below: North America Release: Battle Arena Toshinden Cool Boarders 2 Destruction Derby Final Fantasy 7 Grand Theft Auto Intelligent Qube Jumping Flash Metal Gear Solid Mr Driller Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee Rayman Resident Evil Director’s Cut Revelations: Persona Ridge Racer Type 4 Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo Syphon Filter Tekken 3 Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Twisted Metal Wild Arms Japanese Release: Arc the Lad Arc the Lad 2 Armored Core Battle Arena Toshinden Devil Dice (aka XI [sai]) Final Fantasy 7 G Darius Gradius Gaiden Intelligent Qube Jumping Flash Metal Gear Solid Mr. Driller Parasite Eve Persona Resident Evil Ridge Racer Type 4 SaGa Frontier Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo Tekken 3 Wild Arms While both lists are honestly quite stacked, it's quite surprising to see a few of the names that remain absent -- including platform defining games such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. With that being said, it doesn't come as too much of a surprise given both titles received recent facelifts from Vicarious Visions and Toys for Bob respectively. Other surprising absences include Silent Hill, Gran Turismo, and Castlevania, though I'm not going to argue against the selections too much. Of course, it'd be impossible for Sony to truly appease the entire PlayStation fanbase with just 20 titles, so it'd be interesting to find out just how they compiled the titles they chose. While I'm glad to see Persona included on the list, for example, I can't imagine too many people considered it a higher performing classic than a few of the aforementioned titles. Set to release worldwide on December 3, 2018, the PlayStation Classic can be picked up for $99.99 both online and in-store.

Apparently famed 'IT' reboot director Andy Muschietti seems to think so, with the announcement earlier today that he would be working with Warner Brothers Pictures to create a Hollywood live-action adaptation of the Attack on Titan property. It was only a short time ago that I was writing about the announcement of a Hollywood live-action adaptation of My Hero Academia, another animated property to be caught up in the whirlwind storm that sees properties being picked up left and right. This time, however, I might actually be somewhat optimistic about this, dependant on the direction that Andy Muschietti chooses to take the film. With the incredibly presented horror themes and playful comedy aspects of his latest film, 'IT', if there's anyone I'd choose to adapt the property it'd likely be Andy Muschietti. With the incredible box office performance achieved by 'IT' both in North America and internationally, even given its intense 'R' rating, I can only hope Muschietti is given the green light for a similarly intense film. Right now details are relatively light, though we do know that Harry Potter's David Heyman, Death Note's Masi Oka, and IT's Barbara Muschietti are coming on as producers for the upcoming film. Though the film has been announced, it likely won't be some time until we see it come to light -- especially with 'IT: Chapter Two' slated for a September 6, 2019, theatrical run.|Attack on Titan, Attack on Titan Hollywood, Andy Muschietti, Attack on Titan live-action
14576|2018-10-29|16:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/kimi-to-nami-ni-noretara/| News | Anime | Famed 'Devilman Crybaby' Director Masaaki Yuasa Has Revealed His New Film | At long last, we have a glimpse into Masaaki Yuasa's latest work. |Ever since establishing his animation studio Science Saru in 2014, director Masaaki Yuasa has made quite the splash with movies like Night is Short, Walk On Girl and Lu Over the Wall, as well as his most recent made-for-Netflix television series Devilman Crybaby, a visceral retelling of Go Nagai's iconic manga series Devilman. Easy and widespread access to Yuasa's works has positioned the director to undoubtedly be one of the most prominent creators in a generation, not even to mention the amazing quality his studio produces. We knew to expect a new announcement over the weekend as the "The World of Masaaki Yuasa" special exhibition is taking place at the Tokyo International Film Festival, but we weren't clued in exactly what to expect in terms of genre and mood. As it turns out, his new film is very loosely related to Lu Over the Wall in a singular element, according to the director's own words. The title is Kimo to, Nami ni Noretara, which could be translated to something like ”If I Could Ride the Waves With You," though an official English title has not been finalized. As is apparent from the title and the movie's key artwork, the film holds the ocean as a central theme. During the reveal, however, Yuasa shed some light on the story and the characters which are bound to introduce an interesting dynamic and contrast to the film. The woman is Hinako Mukaimizu, an avid surfer worried about her future. The guy though? He's a firefighter named Minato Hinageshi, and Yuasa says to expect a lot of stark contrast between water and fire in the movie. Luckily, the film's distributor TOHO is here to provide an official synopsis as well: Upon entering university, Hinako moves to a coastal town. She loves surfing, and when she's on the waves she's fearless, but still feels uncertain about her future. When a fire wreaks havoc in the town, Hinako encounters young firefighter Minato. As they surf and spend more time together, Hinako feels drawn to someone like Minato who devotes himself to helping other people. Hinako also holds a special place in Minato's heart. During the reveal, Yuasa mentioned that he has finished all the storyboarding and that they are now working on the animation. He did admit though the project is a little behind schedule, but that it is due to hit theaters in Japan sometime in the Summer of 2019. Finally, he also mentioned that he decided to make this film a love story partly due to the fact that Lu Over the Wall was not. Details are certainly scarce, but you can be sure that we'll continue to provide all the latest on the film as the details ride the waves our way. With the Yuasa touch and hopefully another widespread release, I'd say we have another hit coming our way shortly.|Kimi to, nami no noretara, Masaaki Yuasa, Masaki Yuasa, DEVILMAN crybaby

With the release of that single just around the corner, Yonezu has been working hard to drum up excitement -- not that he really needs to try -- and earlier this week took that a step further by showcasing his latest music video for the single's second title track, "TEENAGE RIOT". It's a massive departure from the more pop-like sounds of "Flamingo", especially with Yonezu's latest infusing a much heavier rock presence, but it's definitely a fitting sound for him. Apparently, I'm not the only one that thinks this either, with the video currently topping YouTube as the #1 trending video in Japan at the time of writing. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, however, especially with the rapidly-growing global presence that Kenshi Yonezu commands leading into 2019. Set to release in Japan on December 10, Kenshi Yonezu's latest three-track single "Flamingo / TEENAGE RIOT" is undoubtedly something you'll be hearing on repeat for quite some time around the streets of Japan -- something I think I'm totally okay with.

This isn't the first time we've seen both Sonic the Hedgehog and THUNDERBOX collaborate, though this is the first time we've seen Amy Rose featured, likely in a bid to attract the more traditional customer base of the Laforet building. From muted pinks to clean black and white designs, the collection contains more than a few must-have pieces. Though it's currently unknown if the collection will remain a Laforet exclusive, or if it'll eventually find its way to THUNDERBOX's online store and in-store Nakano location at Nazo no Mise, we can only hope to see even more from THUNDERBOX. With the recent launch of international shipping from the brand, a much welcome addition to their current services, there couldn't be a better time to start digging through the brand's hyper-inspired catalog. Those interested in checking out even more on THUNDERBOX's upcoming 'Sonic the Hedgehog' collaboration, as well as their pre-existing catalog, be sure to check out the brand's official website.|THUNDERBOX, Sonic the Hedgehog, sonic, THUNDERBOX Sonic, Laforet, Laforet HARAJUKU, Sega

Perhaps more so than anything else, one of the most unique aspects of PARK's existence is the staff's curation with every product carried in the store. Moreso than anything else, this ensures products are a realistic representation of the store's tagline "FASHION x OTAKU x CREATION". This week they take that to a new level, with the "Tokyo EMOtee" project. Starting this month PARK Harajuku will be taking their curation to new heights through the Tokyo EMOtee project. Calling on a wide variety of new-age Japanese creators, the project will see monthly releases of fresh clothing lineups that aim to capture the various emotions of Tokyo within that given month. Kickstarting the project is illustrator and in-store frequent collaborator Tamano Hazuki with three different t-shirts aiming to capture the emotions of "hungry", "busy", and "calm". The project will see a different creator handling designs for each month, with both the creator and the lineup being revealed on the given day of release. Given the incredible pool of talent that PARK has long been known for working alongside, there's really no doubt in my mind that each drop is going to find its way onto my must-have list. With PARK recently launching international shipping via their webstore, this certainly couldn't come at a better time either. Those interested in checking out further information on the current collection, as well as future releases, be sure to head over to PARK Harajuku's official website.|EMOtee, Park Harajuku, PARK

14568|2018-10-26|16:00||http://otaquest.com/persona-venom-collab/| News | Games | ‘Persona’ Series Joins Forces With ‘Venom’ for Upcoming Japanese Release | Collaborating with such a massively successful movie like Venom has been humbling for even the gigantic Persona series, whose latest mainline entry Persona 5 recently topped over 2.2 million sales worldwide. |With Marvel properties having already taken firm hold of popular culture in the West, we’ve been seeing a big marketing push in recent years for the live-action Marvel movies that get a release in Japan, as the various companies behind the films seek to extend their influence beyond the English-speaking countries of the world. And what better way to do so than by having some already beloved characters and series do the promotion for you? Sony’s Venom is the latest movie to do just this, following in the footsteps of an Avengers: Infinity War x My Hero Academia crossover earlier this year, by joining forces with Atlus’ incredibly successful Persona series. Two promotional videos featuring Theodore of Persona 3 and Joker/Ren Amamiya of Persona 5 explaining what the movie is about have been shared ahead of Venom’s November 2 Japanese release, and you check them out below: Although such a collaboration sounds silly at first, it’s a pretty smart move by Sony when you consider that the older audience that the Persona series attracts is exactly the type of people they want to come and watch their “dark action” superhero film. Furthermore, as the voice of Jun Fukuyama as Joker actually states in the trailer, there’s a lot that the Phantom Thieves share with the symbiote Venom - they both serve justice in a way that’s outside of the law, in such a way that could be considered “evil” by some. Venom has been doing extremely well in the West so far, something nobody predicted given the poor response from critics, and it looks as though Sony is keen to replicate that success in Japan. Indeed, the Japanese marketing for the movie firmly pushes the character of Venom as “Spider-Man’s arch nemesis,” something which has been left unsaid in much of the English-language marketing due to legal reasons. Again, this is a smart move by Sony, as Spider-Man properties have always done well in Japan, with there even being a tokusatsu Spider-Man series back in the 1970s. Collaborating with such a massively successful movie has been humbling for even the gigantic Persona series, whose latest mainline entry Persona 5 recently topped over 2.2 million sales worldwide. Attached to PV were comments from the voice actors for both Theodore and Joker, and Jun Fukuyama (Joker) was quick to say that he “never imagined that an anime like Persona 5 would be collaborating with such a worldwide hit as Venom...”. What kind of an effect the film’s collaboration with Persona remains to be seen, but it does represent a serious effort on the Western studios’ part to push the latest western trend of live-action superhero movies into Japan. Let’s just hope their efforts don’t fail, much like a turd in the wind.|Persona, Venom, Persona Venom
14567|2018-10-26|14:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/halloween-comicfest-free-manga/| News | Manga | Free Manga Offerings During This Year's Halloween Comicfest | Every year the comic book industry teams up with local comic book stores to give free comics away on Halloween, and several manga publishers are known to join in. Here's what they're offering in 2018! |Halloween is upon us, and that also means that the second of two annual free comic book events across the US is about to occur. Halloween Comic Fest is an event coordinated by Diamond Comic Suppliers, many major comic book publishers, and comic book stores all across the United States. Each of the publishers involved produce full size & miniature comics which are then given away for free to readers, with limitations to be determined by the comic shop itself. Of course, the big draws for this event generally tend to be titles from Marvel, DC Comics, and Image Comics, but several manga publishers get in on the event every year, and this year the offerings are among the best I've seen in the several years I've been following it. Starting things off this year is a pair of titles from VIZ Media. Each year they do one full-sized comic feared towards older audiences and one mini-comic geared toward a younger audience. This year's full-sized offering is an excerpt from a collection of short stories by horror manga master, Junji Ito, "Frankenstein". It's a perfect compliment to the holiday, and given that last year they offered a selection from Junji Ito's shiver, it's a great follow up for new readers of his work. For the younger audiences, they're offering a sample from the US translation of Sankichi Hinodeya's ongoing Splatoon Manga. This is also very fitting as in previous years they've offered different selections from the Pokémon & Yokai Watch manga. Next up, Kodansha is offering the English translation of a Battle Angel Alita story that has never been published outside of Japan before. The new story, "Battle Angel Alita: Homecoming" (by Yukito Kishiro), is from a forthcoming collection of stories they'll be releasing just in time for the Robert Rodriguez directed live action film. Yen Press is contributing this year with a selection of the horror manga from Hiroumi Aoi entitled "Shibuya Goldfish". The tale follows a high school student named Hajime Tsukiyoda as he tries to survive a horrifying trip to Shibuya where bloodthirsty flying goldfish are ascending upon the frantic citizens of Tokyo. Last but certainly not least, Vertical Comics is bringing a sample of Tsutomu Nihei's latest science fiction work, APOSIMZ. It's a story of survival set in deep space with challenges like disease and aggressive automatons threatening the surviving losers of a war that have left them cast out of society on a cold and unforgiving planetary surface. Nihei's past works, BLAME! and Knights of Sidonia were amazing in their own right, so this is definitely a recommended pickup if you can locate it. The offerings this year overall look incredibly interesting and should stand as really worthy introductions to existing franchises & established mangaka for new readers. I am personally a little bit disappointed to see Drawn & Quarterly skip out on the event this year, as in previous years they have offered selections of their English adaptation of Shigeru Mizuki's "Gegege no Kitaro" manga, and I'm always happy to see that franchise exposed to new readers. Word to the wise as well for those of you who plan to partake in this year's offerings: comic book stores tend to order much less of the manga offerings than they do of the mainstream comics. That means you should definitely try to arrive early, or even call your local shop to ask if they'll have the titles you're looking for available on the day. Remember to support your local comic shops, and for a full list of those participating you can check out the Halloween Comic Fest official website. Happy hunting (and reading)!|

Joining the announcement was an all-new trailer highlighting the upcoming remastered title, as well as a few new features and changes to certain characters. Though the basis for the game remains much the same from its original PlayStation 3 release in 2010, the most notable difference is the change in actors and models for character Masayoshi Tanimura, which is being changed from its original likeness of Hiroki Narimiya to Toshiki Masuda. The title also runs noticeably smoother, offering a much higher framerate over the original release, while offering higher resolution textures. While it's no Kiwami remake, it'll be interesting to see just how the game feels to play in comparison with other recent releases. Set to release in Japan on January 17, 2019, it'll be interesting to see just how SEGA and the team at ATLUS who have been handling the series translations plan to handle the growing pile of unreleased titles on PlayStation 4 in the West. In the meantime, it has additionally been detailed that Yakuza 5 will be released in Japan during Spring 2019, only further adding to that ever-growing list of titles to be released internationally. |Yakuza, Yakuza 4, Yakuza 4 PS4

The announcement launched a release schedule spanning several weeks to bring new music from Kizuna AI to the world weekly featuring a wide array of influential trackmakers in Japan on each track. The first of nine releases, "future base", began streaming today, while "new world" will begin streaming next week. Additionally announced alongside the new musical project was Kizuna AI's first live, "hello, world" at both Zepp DiverCity TOKYO on December 29, and Zepp Osaka Bayside on December 30, 2018. The event is being held as both a celebration of the consecutive nine weeks of music releases, as well as a celebration of Kizuna AI's second year of activity as a Virtual YouTuber. If there's anything I've learned from these past few months, it's that when it comes to Virtual YouTubers, anything is possible. While the pop cultural phenomenon was once limited to the confines of their namesake platform, we've seen the digital talent take over real-life television programming, become the faces of mass-marketing campaigns, and even at some point take over the playlists of just about every DJ in Tokyo with the wildfire-like surge of music from the viral hit-makers. With these next nine weeks promising to present some pretty large collaborations, it'll be exciting to see what Kizuna AI continues to bring to the table musically, especially following two incredible releases with both Yunomi and NOR. Further information on the releases, as well as the upcoming live shows in Tokyo and Osaka, can be found via Kizuna AI's official website.|Kizuna Ai, Yunomi, future base
14554|2018-10-25|15:00||http://otaquest.com/new-days-isekai-manga/| News | Manga | Real Life Convenience Store to Appear in New “Conbini Isekai” Manga | With the recent boom in the popularity of 'isekai' franchises in Japan, it was only a matter of time until one manga questioned life with a conbini in a fantasy world. |Convenience stores, commonly referred to as “conbini,” are such an essential part of modern Japanese life that it’d be difficult to imagine a society without them. Far more than just selling food and drink, you can photocopy documents, pay your bills, and even pick up packages through them - so perhaps it was only a matter of time, in light of the recent explosion in popularity of “isekai” franchises, until one manga dared ask the question - what if there was a conbini in a fantasy isekai world? Author Hirukuma and illustrator Kiki seek to answer that question with their new series Isekai Conbini New Days. As you’d expect, the basic premise of the story is that of a conbini existing and operating in an isekai fantasy world, and deals with the various encounters with the fantasy creature customers that our two protagonists have. This manga also features an actual conbini brand in the form of a New Days store, which while doesn’t have as much of a presence as other, bigger franchises such as Family Mart and Lawson (since it mainly operates in train stations), still adds real-life credibility to this isekai setting. This is critical since many other isekai series have tried to deliver on the same concept of customer service in an isekai world - the first that comes to mind is Restaurant in Another World - but what many of these series lacks is recognizable brands, for fear of legal action. Therefore, I have no doubt that the usage of an actual conbini chain will be beneficial for the series as a whole. It’ll also be helpful in terms of sales, as New Days is understandably pushing the series quite heavily in its stores, as it will stock the first collected volume of the series in 295 of its stores nationwide, as well as premiere new 4 panel comics on its display screens. The series itself is currently being serialized in Square Enix’s online manga app “Manga UP!,” which you can download and use to read the manga for free online. While illustrator Kiki is a relative newbie to the manga world as far as I can tell, the author Hirukuma already has several series under their belt with a Konosuba spin-off focusing on the side character Dust, as well as the more outlandish Reborn as a Vending Machine, Now I Wander the Dungeon, which has been picked up for English release by Yen Press. Both of these works have great humor and have generally been well received, which only gives me high hopes for this new series. With that, I’ll be sure to pick up the first volume of the series, which is on sale now, whenever I next wander into a New Days for a morning melon pan, or an evening Strong Zero.|Isekai, Conbini Manga
14553|2018-10-25|14:00||http://otaquest.com/fifty-and-over-anime/| News | Anime | Age 50 and Over Japanese Otaku Reveal Their Favorite Anime | Otakus in Japan over the age of 50 have gathered together to share their favorite anime series in a recently conducted poll. |You might not have known, but October 22 saw the yearly celebration of Anime Day, which takes its date from the Toei Animation produced 1958 film The Tale of the White Serpent - the first color anime to ever be produced. This year was particularly special as it marks 100 years since the release of what is often considered the first anime ever produced in Japan, that being the 1917 film The Story of the Concierge Mukuzo Imokawa. In celebration of Anime Day, Japanese otaku news outlet Anime Anime took it upon themselves to ask the very simple question to its readers - what is your favorite anime? With such a simple question and a large readership, along with the variety in responses they received, it seemed a shame to simply collate them all into one piece, so the site has been slowly releasing the results to the survey by demographic, accompanied by some analysis. And one particularly interesting piece of the results was the over 50s category, whose answers may shock you. Check them out, in order of most popular, below: Space Battleship Yamato Ganba no Bouken Mobile Police Patlabor Mobile Suit Gundam Code Geass: Lelouch of the Revolution SHIROBAKO Strike Witches A Place Further than the Universe Turn A Gundam Tiger & Bunny Baka and Test Fullmetal Alchemist Baki Penguin Highway Magical Princess Milky Momo In some ways, these answers are what you’d expect from the demographic. There’s a lot of series from the 1970s and 1980s, which was when they would have been watching anime at their most impressionable age, but there are also a few newer anime that I was surprised to see on there - not least of which the inclusion of Strike Witches, which I didn’t even think had fans outside of military otaku. By far the most popular genre among the demographic appears to be the science-fiction genre, with Space Battleship Yamato taking the crown, and two other Gundam series being featured along with Patlabor -- then the more unorthodox Code Geass. This isn’t much of a surprise considering that anime in the 1970s and 80s was dominated by science fiction, very much due to the dual influence of Osamu Tezuka and Star Wars, but is interesting nevertheless. What’s strangest to me is the inclusion of anime that have released only recently, such as A Place Further than the Universe and Penguin Highway, the latter of which only released in theatres a couple of months ago. This could simply be due to how good these two anime are, or we could be seeing a bit of recency bias in play. Given that, it’s reasonable to take these results with a grain of salt, even if they do shine the spotlight on an oft-forgotten portion of otakudom. Source: Anime Anime|Japanese otaku, Otaku
14552|2018-10-25|13:00||http://otaquest.com/godzilla-evangelion-usj/| News | Anime , Manga | Godzilla to Face Off Against ‘Evangelion’ at Universal Studios Japan | The Godzilla vs Evangelion attraction will be joining the likes of Attack on Titan and Lupin the Third in what is shaping up to be an amazing year for Universal Studio Japan’s Cool Japan initiative. |Something big is coming to Universal Studios Japan this summer. When I say big, I mean big -- something that towers over skyscrapers and dwarfs entire metropolises. That something, or somethings, is none other than the legendary Godzilla and Unit-01 from Evangelion, who will both be stomping their way into USJ’s line-up of attractions for next year’s “Cool Japan” programme. Contrary to your immediate thought, they won’t simply be receiving new attractions individually -- they will instead be facing off against each other for the first time, in a new 3D theatre experience that’s sure to bring a smile to the faces of kaiju and mecha otaku alike. Furthermore, although we don’t have a name for the new attraction yet, we do have a teaser image of the two titans squaring up and the tagline of “The world envies, Japan enjoys!”. Details on the actual attraction itself are limited at the moment, although the fact is has been called a 3D attraction makes me think that it will be somewhat similar to the pre-existing Harry Potter and Transformers attractions which utilize 3D film along with moving carriages and platforms. Despite a lack of details, it’s already set to make its appearance during the “summer term” of Cool Japan’s programme, which runs from May 31 to August 25 next year. The other “term” of the programme, the spring term, runs from January 18 to July 23, which provides a perfect period of 23 days between May 31 and July 23 in which you’ll be able to enjoy both attractions from both terms, as some attractions are only running in certain terms. The Godzilla vs Evangelion attraction will be joining the likes of Attack on Titan, Lupin the Third, and Detective Conan in what is shaping up to be an amazing year for USJ’s Cool Japan initiative, which develops attractions based on Japanese popular culture. It’s no surprise that they’re going all out, however, as the initiative is celebrating its 5th birthday this year - and what better way to celebrate by combining two of Japan’s biggest cultural icons?|Godzilla, Evangelion, Universal Studios Japan, USJ, Godzilla Evangelion
14551|2018-10-25|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/my-hero-academia-hollywood/| News | Anime , Manga | 'My Hero Academia' to Receive Live-Action Hollywood Treatment | My Hero Academia was announced today to be the latest movie to receive the Hollywood treatment from Legendary Pictures. |While most of the Western anime community continue to voice their concerns over Hollywood's ongoing need to bring their favorite series to the silver screen in an unwanted live-action format, Legendary Entertainment today shared that they'll be doing just that with fan-favorite My Hero Academia. Following the recent theatrical success of My Hero Academia: Two Heroes in North America, it comes to little surprise that this announcement is being made, but that doesn't mean we're any less worried. Handling the live-action adaptation at Legendary will be both Alex Garcia and Jay Ashenfelter, while representative Ryosuke Yoritomi from Shueisha will oversee the project. TOHO will be in charge of distribution for the film throughout Japan. Additional staff, castings, or details are yet to be revealed, with both Detective Pikachu and Godzilla: King of the Monsters on track to be the next theatrical releases from Legendary during May 2019. Capturing two of the biggest trends right now, both superheroes and anime, it was logically a no-brainer for Legendary Entertainment to bring My Hero Academia onboard for an adaptation. But while the series is one of the biggest properties right now amongst anime fans, the question remains as to just how many people actually want to see a real-life version of All Might on the big screen. While I'm extremely uncertain of the projects actual potential, I feel so desensitized at this point that it really doesn't hit as hard as it might have 2-3 years ago. I'm sure that we'll be seeing more information on the project in the coming months, though I doubt that the film will be coming out anytime soon. When that information does arrive, however, I'll be sure to keep you updated. Until then, be sure to check out the incredible anime adaptation of My Hero Academia if you're yet to give it a watch.

14544|2018-10-24|15:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/m-flo-20-years-interview/| News | Music | 20 Years of m-flo: The Rhyme Brokers In Their Own Words | It's been 20 years since the release of their first indie single, "The Rhyme Brokers", and we asked each member of the powerhouse trio to reminisce on those early days. |20 years ago today the Japanese hip-hop scene was introduced to one of the most extraordinary groups that would ever grace their musical landscape. At the time they were a modest success, but in only a few short years Taku Takahashi, VERBAL, and LISA would take Japan (and the world) by storm with their unique sound and experimental style. Their first single as a trio, "The Rhyme Brokers", was also the US's earliest exposure to the group, having appeared in the first entries of Konami's beatmania IIDX & Dance Dance Revolution franchises. It didn't take long for their follow up, "Been So Long" to come out and blow up in a serious way, leading to a legacy that is still being written by 3 ultra-talented friends who aren't afraid to try different things and love what they do. Since Taku Takahashi is also one of the founding fathers of OTAQUEST, I asked him if we could get some statements from the 3 of them about those early days. Thankfully all were happy to oblige. Continue reading for some first-hand insight on the early days of m-flo, the recording of "The Rhyme Brokers", and a look at what the future holds. OTAQUEST: It's been 20 years since your first single, "The Rhyme Brokers" was released. Can you tell us a bit about how you all got together, and what it was like working together in those early days? VERBAL: Taku and I used to be in a band together in high school, so we go way back. I think about like a high school dance party where Taku would bring out his turntables, and I don't even think they were meant for DJing. But we had records and I remember him there DJing, there was a point where we got together and starting jamming at these high school dance parties. That's how we originally got together and started our band. Fast forward a couple of years when we got together and started m-flo, we recorded our first song and that was called "The Rhyme Brokers". Just to give you some context on what it was like in the late 90's in Japan, hip-hop and R&B were booming at the time so there were a lot of new acts coming out. It was a very prime-time for us to release our kind of music and do what we had aspired to do. When we made that first song together, it was around that time that we figured "hey, this is going to be a new group, so we should give it a new name." The name we originally came up with was "Mediarite-Flow", which eventually became m-flo. Anyways, I remember us making a demo cassette and we would drive around banging it in Taku's car. It had an open roof, and we would just be banging it, we thought it was the shit. Soon after that Taku approached me and said: "You know what, we want to add another element to this, so let's ask LISA." LISA was somebody we knew from high school, she was a year above us. She was the queen boss, you know? We knew she was a singer too, so I thought that was great, I was like "Bet, she should sing on it!" That became "The Rhyme Brokers" that everyone has heard today. It gave m-flo a new life, and is safe to say was really the beginning. Taku: So 20 years ago VERBAL and I were doing a group together when we came up with "The Rhyme Brokers". At the time I knew LISA was singing as a professional, so I asked her to sing on our track. I thought the result was really good and that we should make another tune. That next song was "Been So Long", and after that, we asked LISA to officially join the group as m-flo. LISA: 20 years ago, oh wow. Taku was always making music. Taku's always doing his thing. He had asked me to come to his house and listen to a bunch of his music. One song he had said "Listen to this rapper, it's like really out there." When I heard it I was like "Woah. Taku. Who's this guy?" and was like "Oh, it's Young-Kee." I was like "Young-Kee!? Like that Young-Kee in our school? Really!? No." So a few weeks went by and Taku said "You know what. Why don't we try to do something, us three together?" so I asked him what he wanted to do. He told me to come up with something like a loop tune, something repetitious, like a killer hook or melody that would latch onto people's ear so they won't forget us. I told him I would do it and he said "Just write something really crazy, like you." crazy like me? You got it! I had done that and then we met up at the studio. That was the first time I had actually met VERBAL. I had seen him here and there in school and everything, but to really really meet him that was the first time. It was the first day of recording for "The Rhyme Brokers" too, so can you imagine how nervous I was? So then here comes VERBAL and I was shaking because I was kinda nervous, I don't know what he's going to say to me. The first thing he told me, I don't know how to say it in english, but he was like "なんかヤンキーぽいな" so I was like "Yankee? What! Man what!? How could you say that to me?" In English that's probably like "Oh, you're kinda raggedy" or "you're kinda street-ish" like a really street kind of girl. So you know, I did not feel good about it. But you know, brother was very young and you gotta let that go *laughs* because if I didn't let that go then we would have never come up with "The Rhyme Brokers" so there it is. Rhyme Brokers, 20 years ago! Wow. OTAQUEST: Did you have any image at the time of how the future might turn out for m-flo? Taku Takahashi: I had an image that we would be really successful. I never had a doubt, to be honest. I thought we were bringing out something different to Japan and that was my goal. I knew we would do it in the best way. I never thought we would be doing this for 20 years, but I thought we had a bright future. We were very fortunate that we have been able to do this for so long. LISA: What we were thinking back then was not really like "OK! We're going to move on like this and move on like that!" It really wasn't like that. We were such an experimental group, every song is strictly experimental. But we wanted to put our best into every song we make. Whether we had the chance to release it nor not, record company or not, it didn't matter. If we got together we wanted to put together something really hot. So that's how it happened, we were just concentrating on "The Rhyme Brokers" and that went really well. Not as in the charts, but our staff that listened to it all really liked it and hey encouraged us to make another song together. That song was "Been So Long", and a lot of people everywhere really liked that so that brought us out into the world and let people know that m-flo exists. "Been So Long" was our first hit, but "The Rhyme Brokers" was the beginning. OTAQUEST: Does it feel like it's really been 20 years since it all started to you? VERBAL: I did not expect 20 years of m-flo because I was thinking about quitting rapping before I hit 30. I thought that was the cool thing, start a new business or do something else. But life takes form in different ways and I'm really thankful that I'm able to be creative to this day. I get to work with Taku & LISA, make tracks, make songs for the fans out there. I would say it was like a quick 20 years, and we really feel blessed to be doing what we love for so many years. Taku Takahashi: 20 years, I still can't believe it. The best word to describe it is "weird". *laughs* I just couldn't imagine that 20 years have passed. Being a professional musician, although I had mentioned that I had faith in ourselves, it's still very surreal to me. Recording with, and meeting artists, even meeting with new artists I feel like "Oh my god, I'm seeing this popular person!" or "Oh wow, this singer is so famous and I'm talking to her!" It's always surreal and I think it will be that way for me forever. LISA: Yeah, It's been 20 years. Oh wow, very long but at the same time very fast. You can't imagine how life just goes so fast, oh my goodness, it's just scary sometimes. It does feel like 20 years too sometimes because wow when you sing those songs from 20 years ago over and over and over again you think "This song has taken me places!" And you know, a lot of gratitude to that. I Just appreciate everything, every moment, and what happened even though times were tough sometimes. Even though we didn't agree all the time, or even though we bump heads and all kind of stuff, you know? Good times, and bad times, everything together still equaled up to m-flo and whatever we put out. Wow, there's so much to look back on, but at the same time so much to look forward to. Yeah, we have 20 years under our belt, but we still have 20 more to go! I'm thinking "Taku! VERBAL! Can you do it! Can you do it with me! Oh, you guys are crazy!" Gotta be crazy to go running with me for another 20 years, my brothers. Stay healthy, please! OTAQUEST: Where do you see m-flo heading in the future? VERBAL: I don't know, I mean I definitely didn't think we would be doing this for 20 years but I'm happy that we have and I feel like looking at the way m-flo has evolved; from Taku & me having a high school band to starting with m-flo, LISA joining and then leaving the group, m-flo starting the "loves" series where we collaborate with a bunch of different artists, to LISA coming back and us doing what we're doing now. I mean who knows what the future holds, I'm just excited and I know that this group is here to stay. Taku Takahashi: Honestly I don't know what's going to happen for m-flo in the future, but I can tell you about what's coming up next. We're working on an album right now and we've been releasing stuff recently. We have a project called "Prince Project" where we're working with a bunch of different artists and producing covers of songs from the 80s. Really we just always want to be free and do something fun! We just released "Mars Drive" and "Piece of Me", the next single coming up will be available on Spotify, iTunes, etc. and the new album is coming out next year. Hopefully we get to go to more cities in the US and perform soon too! LISA: Our future is bright. I always try to take everything positive. *laughs* I dunno, I just want my brothers to be healthy. And they need a lot of energy to bear with me too, so I don't know how my brothers are going to keep on moving with me and everything but they gotta drag me along with them! I don't know, I just love them very much and m-flo, we're such a fun group. We're always experimental like I said, and we're just going to keep doing that. We're not gonna be like "This is m-flo style, so this is how you're gonna listen to it!" No, we don't work like that. We always try to put a whole of challenges in it, and we're always challenging ourselves. Who knows where we're gonna go, we're still beginning and still moving forward, running too! Hey, please come along with us for another 20 years. Big up m-flo! Whatcha talking about! OTAQUEST: Do you have any words for your fans in America? VERBAL: First and foremost, when we performed in Los Angeles at Anime Expo's OTAQUEST LIVE this past July, it was a very enlightening experience for us because it was the first time m-flo every performed in the states, and honestly it was an away game you know? We thought the crowd would be super quiet in the seated arena, but much to our surprise a lot of the people knew our lyrics, and most of the people there were an actual American audience, not like Japanese people who had come to the states. I would say over 90% of the crowd was non-Japanese, so for them to know the songs and the hooks to songs, to be rocking with us, I mean it was a blessing and really encouraging to see. That got us really juiced up to want to go perform more oversease, especially in the US. So to the American fans, we're making new music and we're gonna bring back some of the old music to perform for the people who have been listening to us since day one. Be on the lookout, that's probably going to start as early as the beginning of 2019. Stay tuned. Taku Takahashi: I really appreciate your support! Some of you know us from beatmania or Dance Dance Revolution, some might know us from YouTube, or even OTAQUEST. Wherever you found us and listen to our music, it really means a lot and I really appreciate that. Thank you so much. I would love to meet you all as soon as possible! LISA: Mad love to all our fans, mad love from me. You know me, I'm all crazy and everything but crazy love, I have that too. From the bottom of my heart. Yes, we've been around 20 years, but another 20 years coming your way! Oh, be careful! I love you guys so much and I hope to see you soon! Be well and take care. After the comments from the group I wanted to ask Taku a little bit about their first indie release, "The Way We Were", a cover of a Barbara Streisand song that was released alongside "The Rhyme Brokers" back in 1998. The original version of the release featured vocals from Ceybil Jefferies, with a version featuring LISA coming out a few months later. There isn't a lot of information about this particular song online and it's generally an unknown track to m-flo fans in the US so I was hoping he could shed a little bit of light on this mysterious song. OTAQUEST: m-flo isn't a group known for performing covers, so how did you end up recording "The Way We Were", originally a Barabara Streisand song? Taku Takahashi: So "The Way We Were", that's our first single. We had "The Rhyme Brokers" and "The Way We Were" together. Originally it was a GTS project, and GTS was recording it. What I was doing was almost like doing a remix for them. Our producer back then, Masaji Asakawa (G from GTS), liked the remix and said it should be an m-flo tune. While I was doing the remix, VERBAL was in town from Boston, I was already back in Tokyo, and I asked him to rap on it. G (Masaji Asakawa) loved our synergy, so we played him "The Rhyme Brokers" and he liked that too. OTAQUEST: You recorded 2 versions of the song that were released at slightly different times, one with Ceybil Jefferies and one with LISA. What's the story behind that? Taku Takahashi: After "Been So Long" we thought we needed a version for LISA. So that's why there are 2 versions, one with Ms. Ceybil Jefferies and we have the one with LISA. The original recording with Ceybil Jefferies was already there for the remix, so we just added VERBAL's rap. That was the first song played on Japanese radio & TV, but soon after "The Rhyme Brokers" hit and that led to "Been So Long". As someone who counts himself amongst m-flo's earliest fans in the US, it's really amazing to see how far they've come and comforting to know that there's more planned. If you're one of the many out there who also enjoy their music & work, regardless of the era, be sure to look forward for more from this mega-talented group and as always we'll be here supporting and reporting any new developments they might be working on! Thank you to Taku Takahashi, VERBAL, and LISA for their participation in this interview!|m-flo, 20th anniversary, the rhyme brokers, taku, verbal, Lisa
14534|2018-10-23|15:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/rezero-memory-snow-impressions/| News | Anime | [Impressions] Theatrical Release of 'Re:ZERO Memory Snow' OVA | The newest addition to the 'Re:Zero' chronicle is likely a little different from what you might expect, but that's totally a good thing. |When Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- began airing during the Spring season back in 2016, it was easy to assume that it was going to some typical fantasy light novel affair, in a world that was already awash in the “isekai” genre. I remember quite clearly the few weeks span during which the show evolved its status as an enjoyable outlier to all-out smash-hit, due in no small part to its stellar cast of characters, and little aversion to some truly ruthless action every now and then. As for what you can expect from this new OVA, I’ll go ahead and say that you’re going to want to expect a ton of attention paid towards developing the aforementioned cast, and little of that latter aspect. Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow serves as a sort of side story, chronologically taking place between episodes 12 and 13 of the anime, right after the Mabeast incident in the forest outside the village. At this point in the series, you could say that the main cast was at peace; mingling together and living as one big happy family under Roswaal-sama’s roof. What other point then, would be better to see some of that delicious character exposition? You most likely don’t need me to tell you that the episode revolves heavily on snow, and the circumstances behind its sudden falling were quite amusing and hardly sinister in nature. In fact, I found myself letting out quite a few laughs there in the theater with my fellow audience members. When I heard Subaru describing his epic quest thus far in a long string of questionable English, I just about lost it. I dare say that the episode’s comedy was one of its absolute strong points. There are puns and visual gags aplenty, as Re:ZERO’s unique brand of humor was dialed up to 10. Jokes are not the only thing that served up in the visual department, however, with quite a few wildly-cute fan service shots sure to please all, ahem, no matter which team you might be on. I really appreciated the balance in screen time given to everyone, most especially to little Beatrice, who I felt was lagging behind a bit in the main series. The animation was very consistent, ranging from the relatively high-grade style found in the main series, to absolutely gorgeous when highlighting some of the climactic scenes amidst the falling snow. After everything was said and done, the OVA’s theme song, nonoc’s “White White Snow”, floored me with its ability to transport me into a snowy landscape. Her delicate vocals and whispy melody seriously rival “Stay Alive” for the top bit of music the franchise has to offer. As far as my favorite part of the 60-minute episode goes, you’ll first have to know that I am quite on the side of Emilia-tan, MAJI TENSHI. If you don’t want some slight spoilers on one of the gag bits, then I advise skipping to the next paragraph. If you’re still with me, however, then know that it was absolutely impossible for me to wipe the smile from my face when she, let’s just say, tried a certain something for the first time in her life. The next 15 minutes are some of her cutest moments to date, and I think that’s saying a lot. All in all, if you’re wanting a bit of a slice-of-life take on the Re:ZERO universe; I mean, come on, give these characters a break — then you should definitely be looking forward to this OVA. The theater environment I watched it in served to accentuate the superb music and visuals, and I hope that an even wider audience gets the chance to experience it that way. If not, this is still a solid A+ OVA that you’re going to want to see one way or another!|Re:Zero, Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-, Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow, Memory Snow, OVA

Nothing has done that more than the series’ own connection to the world of fashion, having collaborated with many influential designers over the years, as well as launching its own fashion brand in RADIO EVA. With this year seeing in 10 years since RADIO EVA’s founding in 2008, it should come as no surprise that the brand is adding some seriously stylish new additions to its lineup. Not only that, but prominent animator Yoneyama Mai - who has worked as an animation director on such well-known projects as Black Rock Shooter, Little Witch Academia and Darling in the Franxx over the years - is drawing the key visual for this line-up, which has, in turn, informed the aesthetic of the pieces. Check it out below: Most of the clothes that the characters are wearing in this key visual are the actual pieces that have been added to RADIO EVA’s inventory, and while I love the aesthetic of most of them, there are a few stand out pieces for me. First up are the two flannel shirts that both Rei and Shinji are wearing. There are actually two colors for this piece, but personally, I’m more drawn to the white and black color scheme worn by Rei: I’m also drawn to the track gear modelled by Shinji, who always appears to be the character that many of the Evangelion fashion lines over the years choose to model track gear. Why that is, I have no idea, but nevertheless the track pants and jacket he wears not only look comfy but are subtly accented by the color purple, adding that Unit-01 flair: But even better than the previous pieces are those modeled by the lovely Asuka. This isn’t just because she’s the best girl (a potentially loaded statement, I know), but because they exemplify her character perfectly - as well as being stylish, of course. The leggings she models have NERV ONLY written on them in a scrawl, which reminds me of her mental anguish after her fight with the Fifteenth Angel. A strange thing to want to wear for some, but for me, it’s a perfect way to show my love for her character arc and development. Her bomber jacket is also great, pairing a nice military-green palette with bold NERV text on the back. But even if you’re not a fan of that design, then don’t worry - because the jacket can be reversed to reveal a similar, scrawled design to her leggings. And while I think I’d prefer to be a little more subtle, it’s always great to have options. All of the above items, and much more, can be found via RADIO EVA’s online store on the “10th” tab. They can, of course, be bought in real life from the Eva Store located in Ikebukuro, where you will also be able to try on the various items for size. Considering that these items are on the expensive side, that might be a good idea. Furthermore, a pop-up shop is scheduled to take place in Sapporo from October 24, as well as one in Ikebukuro from November 22.|Neon Genesis Evangelion, Evangelion, RADIO EVA

14531|2018-10-23|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/snails-house-snailchan-adventure/| News | Music | Snail's House Releases Latest 'Snailchan Adventure' M/V | Snail's House and Speedoru (formally Speedo Sausage) are back with a gorgeous new animated music video for Snail's House' infectious new tune 'Snailchan Adventure'. |It's completely insane to think that it's been a year since Snail's House originally dropped the monolith music video for "Pixel Galaxy" in collaboration with animator Speedo Sausage -- who now goes by the name Speedoru --, but here I am in 2018 still as hooked as ever. There's a whole lot of reason to celebrate when it comes to that music video, but what better way to celebrate with the release of another incredible music video? Well, shared on Snail's House' official YouTube channel earlier today, the latest animated music video for "Snailchan Adventure" can be peeked below: I don't even know where to begin with this one, but damn. While "Pixel Galaxy" certainly set a bar, there's no questioning the fact that "Snailchan Adventure" completely blew it out of the water. From the hyperactive motion, the gorgeous style, the incredible music, and the ever-present references, both Snail's House and Speedoru completely hit out of the park here. Immediately getting into things, we're treated to a parody of Game Center CX star Shinya Arino as appearing on "Snail Center CX" -- with his smile and optimism intact -- followed by the hypersonic adventure of both Snailchan and Red Panda. Along the way, they're faced up against BIG DUCKIE, the first villain to be destroyed by Red Panda's take on Fist of the North Star's Hyakuretsu Ken before the legendary "Omae wa mou Shindeiru" declaration. Following this Snailchan and Red Panda are faced up against Killzila, a simultaneous parody of both Studio TRIGGER's Kill la Kill and TOHO's Godzilla. Before reaching the third fight, we see a handful of self-references including the jacket character for Snail's House' own "Alien Pop", as well as a quick take on Pop Team Epic and Street Fighter along the way. Throw in a little Dance Dance Revolution, a few callbacks to the music video for "Pixel Galaxy", a short-lived boss fight and the final credit sequence -- it's basically the perfect ode to everything. If you finished watching the music video and thought to yourself, damn, that'd be ridiculously fun as a game, you're in a bit of luck. Snail's House has mentioned previously that an actual game based on the music video is on track for a January 2019 release date, something of which is taking up a large amount of his time. If the game manages to capture the beauty of the music video in full stride, I can only imagine how enjoyable it'll end up being -- I'm honestly pretty excited. Snailchan Adventure by Ujico*/Snail&#39;s House In addition to the music video, Snail's House also released a two-track single for the upcoming game which can be streamed above and purchased via Snail's House' Bandcamp page, here. It'll be particularly exciting to see where both Snail's House and Speedoru go from here, especially after pushing themselves to new levels on this piece. Until that next big thing comes, however, you can check out more from Snail's House here, and Speedoru here.|Snail's House, Ujico, Snailchan Adventure, Speedoru, Speedo Sausage, Snail's House Music Video
14525|2018-10-22|14:00||http://otaquest.com/kenshi-yonezu-flamingo/| News | Music | Kenshi Yonezu Releases Latest Music Video 'Flamingo' | One of Japan's biggest musical acts right now, Kenshi Yonezu, is back with an all-new three-track single 'Flamingo / TEENAGE RIOT' and a music video to match. |Earlier this week saw the release of Kenshi Yonezu's long-awaited ninth single, a sadistically playful tune by the name "Flamingo". Accompanied by an all-new music video which debuted on the rapidly-rising talents YouTube channel, "Flamingo" was joined by the announcement of two other songs composing the three-track single release that is set to drop on October 31, 2018. Shot in and around the parking lot that plays host to the adorably hidden Chinese restaurant Derika, the music video for "Flamingo" is the perfect match for the tone set by Kenshi Yonezu's lyrics. Getting straight to the point, "Flamingo" is very much a Yonezu song, but that's by no means a problem. Much like previous releases, "Flamingo" is a story expressed not just through song, but also Kenshi Yonezu's expressive movements and off-color music video. It's totally questionable whether Kenshi Yonezu himself, or music video director Tomokazu Yamada, is an avid follower of Twitter trends, but I found myself immediately grabbing my phone when I noticed the filming location for this video -- it was all too familiar. As it turns out, this exact spot was the center of a recent viral tweet in Japan detailing the restaurant and sharing praise for its off-trail location and cheap prices. Well, either that or he's a diehard fan of Hiroshi Fujiwara, given it was this exact store that inspired him to launch his The Park-ing pop-up store in Ginza following his chance encounter with Derika while returning to his car. Either way, there remains no doubt to the testament that Kenshi Yonezu is one of the biggest talents in Japan right now, and that's a trend that isn't looking to slow down any time soon. Several months ago the airwaves were filled with "Lemon", Yonezu's eighth single and a major turning point for the artist. Whether it was on television or the streets of Tokyo, your favorite music stores, or even arcades, you couldn't step anywhere without hearing Kenshi Yonezu's infectious life-after-loss ballad. While it remains to be seen if "Flamingo" will have the same lasting effect, this certainly won't be the first time I've had a song called "Flamingo" stuck in my head for weeks on end. |Kenshi Yonezu, Flamingo, TEENAGE RIOT, Kenshi Yonezu Flamingo

Bringing together the respective talents of Taku Takahashi, YUC'e, hy4_4yh, and Kamura Micau all together for a four-and-a-half-minute fever-dream, the video can be checked out below: Filled to the brim with rave stabs and other high energy elements, we're sped through nineteen upcoming and currently available titles at lightspeed to the flow of rap duo hy4_4yh and Kamura Micau layered over Taku Takahashi and YUC'e's signature sounds. If you're familiar with these trailers, you likely already know what's going on, PlayStation Japan throws their most anticipated upcoming titles at you all at once while you're left bouncing around your room to whatever incredibly produced track they bring forward this time. It's a formula that's still yet to disappoint, though this certainly does raise the bar. We're of course seeing a number of titles in the lineup that I can't wait to get my hands on, including SEGA's upcoming JUDGE EYES, as well as Square Enix's much-anticipated Dragon Quest Builders 2, so that ends up amplifying the hype by about a million. With such a flavorful mix of both veteran and up-and-coming musicians brought together for this video, it'll definitely be interesting to see how PlayStation Japan one-up's themselves next time. Now we just wait and see who's next.|Playstation, PS4, PlayStation Lineup, taku takahashi, YUC'e, yuce, hy4_4yh, Kamura Micau

Their music is seemingly everywhere and nowhere at the same time, and it remains truly difficult to really describe their activities with any level of comprehensive understanding. I've attempted a few times in the past to share their music, most of which I listen to a whole lot, but I just genuinely couldn't put words together to describe the group. But here I am once again, giving it a shot, following the release of their latest compilation album "Early Years 2012-2016". For a band that's constantly evolving, four years is a massively expansive time to compile; yet across a tracklist spanning twenty-six tracks, Kindan no Tasuketsu piece together a semi-coherent image of their history through sound. I had most definitely not heard every single one of those aforementioned twenty-six tracks, which honestly made the whole listen-through all the more exciting. There are a few tracks that the group obviously want you to direct your attention to, including the fittingly dreamy single "nemui" which originally released in 2012, having received its own music video earlier this week. It'd be slightly odd for a group to suddenly drop a compilation album like this, were they not teasing a "season 4" of Kindan no Tasuketsu via their various social media accounts. So with an entire "season" of new music on the way from the group, it's cozy being able to divulge in their history via the "Early Years 2012-2016" album. We're sure we'll be seeing more music in the coming months -- if not weeks -- so we'll be sure to keep you updated when it finally drops. Until then, you can check out even more information on the group via their official website.|Kindan no Tasuketsu, Early Years 2012-2016

Trailer Reveals Post-Game Master Trainers | The latest trailer for the upcoming Pokémon: Let's Go! titles earlier this week revealed the existence of post-game 'Master Trainers'. |It was just earlier this week that I was sharing some news about the release of a new trailer for Game Freak's upcoming Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! titles on Nintendo Switch, but it doesn't look like The Pokémon Company is ready to stop dropping teasers just yet. Uploaded to The Pokémon Company's official YouTube channel, the latest trailer gives us a look at some of the post-game content we'll be able to enjoy, namely the "Master Trainers" system that's being implemented. I'm not really sure how cool I am with post-game content just being shown like this, I actually like a bit of surprise, but none-the-less it's pretty neat to see in action. The new "Master Trainers" system effectively introduces a master for each of the original 151 different Pokémon, a trainer that specializes in that Pokémon exclusively, who you can battle with that same Pokémon to earn the title of "Master Trainer". It's a really interesting system, though I really hope that the game doesn't provide you with the particular Pokémon for the battle and leaves trainers catching and training their own. Set to release exclusively on Nintendo Switch on November 16, further information on both ​Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! can be found via the games' official website. Those interested in getting their hands on the upcoming games, as well as a limited-edition Pokémon: Let's Go! Nintendo Switch, be sure to check out our ongoing giveaway, here.|Pokemon

The pop cultural icon joins numerous other characters in the sky, bringing just a little more light to our night alongside Hulk, The Little Prince, Mt. Fuji, and mythological legends Hercules, Perseus, and more. I've never been too good with constellations, but a full visualization of the new Godzilla constellation can be seen below: Made up of numerous likely blazar, a definite blazar, a starburst galaxy, a gamma-ray pulsar, and an unknown entity, the lining is much like other constellations in the fact that you'll definitely have much of your imagination do the work. NASA states on their official website to describe how the constellation came to be " Godzilla's trademark weapon is its "heat ray," a fiery jet. This bears at least a passing resemblance to gamma-ray jets associated with black holes and neutron stars." Obviously there are a lot more technicalities to the Godzilla constellation that I'm not even going to bother trying to wrap my head around, but for those who are interested in checking it out, NASA has created a page to detail it all on their official website.|Godzilla, NASA Godzilla, NASA, Godzilla Constellation
14516|2018-10-19|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/funimation-crunchyroll-license-end/| News | Anime | Funimation Annoucnes End of Licensing Agreement with Crunchyroll | Following the acquisition of Funimation by Sony, it was today announced that the anime publisher would cease agreements with Crunchyroll. |In a somewhat shocking turn of events, it was announced today that Funimation will be ceasing operations with Crunchyroll beginning next month from November 9, 2018. The announcement comes just a year after the acquisition of the anime distributor by Sony Pictures Television, to which Funimation CEO Gen Fukunaga shared that the acquisition directly correlates with the decision to stop collaborative efforts between the two companies. Originally announced in 2016, the partnership brought together the catalogs of both anime giants and allowed customers to reap the rewards of both services in numerous ways. While subscribers to both platforms are likely to feel a little bit of a hit, it was shared by Funimation's Gen Fukunaga that FunimationNow subscribers will have access to several hundred subbed series, but are going to be losing a handful of dubbed series. In addition to this, some content licensed during the partnership will remain on both platforms for now, with currently simulcasting series such as My Hero Academia and Attack on Titan remaining on both platforms. Both platforms have shared that they will disclose what content will be removed at a later date. While this is quite a substantial loss for Crunchyroll, it's been reported that the breakup was executed on good terms between both companies. In addition to this, it's been detailed that Crunchyroll's sister company VRV will be replacing FunimationNow on their streaming platform with content from anime streaming service HIDIVE in the next few weeks. While the timing for this new HIDIVE partnership seems like far too much of a coincidence, Forbes reports that insiders have stated it was unrelated. It'll be interesting to see over the next few months how Sony plans to proceed following their withdrawal of Funimation from the Crunchyroll/VRV partnership. It wouldn't surprise me if this withdrawal is Sony's way of showing that they mean serious business when it comes to taking Funimation to the top, and that is something that will certainly prove interesting from an industry standpoint. Until we find out, however, you'll be able to keep up with everything Funimation on Crunchyroll until ​November 9, 2018. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed.

Indeed, nothing allows you to do so more than the Kaiji VR game, which has been a constant staple in Japan’s many “VR attraction” venues in recent years. Now, that attraction is making it’s way to smartphones - giving even more people the chance to experience Kaiji’s dread first hand. Titled Kaiji VR: The Nightmare Bridge, the game seeks to replicate Kaiji’s experience crossing a bridge suspended between two buildings, as was one of the ‘gambles’ featured in the second part of the series. Simply reading or watching the arc was nerve-wracking enough, and I can promise you that it’s even more terrifying in VR, having had the opportunity to test it out for myself last year. It’s worth noting that the VR game has already seen two ports for PlayStation VR as well as Nintendo Switch last year, but the game’s port to smartphones means greater accessibility, especially for those who can’t simply go and experience it in the VR attraction venues. And what a perfect time to do so, with Kaiji spinoff Tonegawa currently airing, and the manga having just entered a new arc. The difference between the various ports over the years are interesting, as although the PSVR version of the game was more or less exactly the same as the original version since the Switch doesn’t support VR, the version available on the console uses a third person camera in some instances as well as gyro controls. I sincerely doubt that the non-VR version on Switch can capture the same dread you’re able to feel when playing the game in VR, so it’s great to see that version available on smartphones is the VR version - for which you’ll, of course, need some sort of VR goggles/phone strap. The recent activity in properties related to Kaiji is curious, with both spinoff manga Tonegawa and Hancho receiving an anime adaptation, and now with this surprise smartphone port of the VR game. I can only hope that this is to gauge interest for a third season, so if you haven’t checked out the VR game yet, then I’d recommend you do - if only to tell MADHOUSE that we want a third season already. Kaiji VR: The Nightmare Bridge is available now on the App Store and Google Play for 360 yen.|Kaiji, Kaiji VR, Kaiji VR: The Nightmare Bridge

OTAQUEST already had a chance to sit down with the game at this year’s Tokyo Games Show, and while our gameplay impressions were mixed, the recent news of legendary mangaka Akira Toriyama’s involvement in the game was enough to get us excited again. While Toriyama’s original character designs were already previewed during Bandai Namco’s press conference, this month’s V Jump gives a better look at them, as well as some new information. First up are two good guys who will be helping on your journey through the tumultuous world of Jump Force. The bald gentleman is named Grabber and is the leader of Anbras Base, where the player character finds themselves upon awakening. The robot next to him is named Navigator and will provide you with support on your journey - presumably related to character backstories, gameplay controls, and much more. Next to them are two evil characters, who you and the various characters of Jump will find themselves clashing against. On the left, we have Cain, who is a leading figure of the evil organization ‘Venoms.’ The text also states that he is incredibly powerful, which is probably why he thinks that wearing a gold suit of armor is cool. To his right, we find Garena, an associate and member of the same organization of Cain. Interestingly, it is noted that underneath her beauty she hides a secret - perhaps one that could win her over to the good side? One of my main questions surrounding Jump Force was the story’s antagonist since villains from Jump are being featured as playable characters. It’s not surprising that the villain has turned out to be an original character, but getting a veritable legend such as Toriyama to pen the designs was a great move - we’ve already seen how great his designs are in action, and especially in 3D thanks to his continued work on the Dragon Quest as a character designer. With the game’s antagonists revealed, all that really remains now is to see what other Jump characters are confirmed as playable - most recently we’ve had Seiya and Ryu from Saint Seiya confirmed, along with Yu-Gi-Oh!’s Dark Yugi/Pharaoh. I’m still holding out for some characters from Nisio Isin and Akira Akatsuki's excellent Jump series Medaka Box to be confirmed, but we’ll just have to wait and see.|Jump Forces, Akira Toriyama, Dragonball

There were a lot of reasons to be giving it coverage, but more than anything I was just really, really excited to be able to listen to the finished album. Well, its finally here, and I spent most of my day listening to it yesterday to really affirm just how I felt about it. Simply put, "SIXTHSENSE RIOT" is TORIENA's most comprehensive and complete work to date and is not an album I'll be putting down any time soon. From start to finish this album is an undeniable masterpiece the comes in loud and clear with the opening track "SIXTHSENSE". After immediately setting the mood there, we're rushed into the hard-hitting genius that is "BOKU WA FUTSUU NO KO", a performance-ready blend of both classic chiptune sounds and particularly unforgiving kicks. From there we're re-introduced to a number of already familiar tracks including the incredible "DOPING LIFE" before reaching the best-titled track of the year "GIRLS DO NOT DRESS FOR BOYS". Across the total 12 songs on "SIXTHSENSE RIOT" we're met with a myriad of different genres, from TORIENA's more traditional chiptune to Eurobeat and club-ready ballads. Yet even with all these varying styles, the album feels coherent and doesn't leave me hand-picking a few songs that I want to play in a certain order. If I had to choose a favorite song from the album, it'd be a close throwdown between "HI-NRG MONSTER", "SIXTHSENSE", or "BOKU WA FUTSUU NO KO". Though, with that being said, I'd dare say every track on the album kinda slaps in its own way. I'm not going to give this album a number out of ten, but rather, I'm going to really strongly encourage you to go check out the album either in-store if you're in Japan, or definitely online via Apple Music, iTunes, Spotify, or whatever it is you use. TORIENA did something with this piece that genuinely has me wowed, and I can't wait to see where she takes this direction next. As always, you can get even more information on TORIENA's latest "SIXTHSENSE RIOT" album, as well as her launch party event in Shibuya, via her official website.|Toriena, SIXTHSENSE RIOT, Madmilky Records, Madmilky

Contained within the tracklisting for the album were a handful of tracks we'd seen in the past, possibly the wildest of which being a cover of Capsule's 2001 "Koi no Hana" from their album "High Collar Girl"; well, that track earlier this week received a live music video from Kyary's concert, and it absolutely rules. Filmed throughout Kyary Pamyu Pamyu's ongoing CHERRY MARTINI of Stardust tour in Japan, the footage comes courtesy of SPACE SHOWER TV ahead of their documentary on the queen of Harajuku's return to the musical spotlight. The music video alone is gorgeous, but most importantly it showcases Kyary's full return to form with elaborate and dazzling live shows and performances. While "Koi no Hana" is certainly not the hyper-pop sound you'd normally hear from Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, I think she totally nails it and I'd love to see it performed live.

Possibly one of the biggest factors in the surprise of this release was not only the announcement but the fact that the game was released without the standard location testing, updating nationwide simultaneously.

The whole trailer screams originality, and it's that exact charm which brought people to the series in the first place, so I'm definitely excited to see its return. While we haven't been able to make our way over to arcades to check out what new music has been included with the latest update just yet, we'll certainly be getting some game time as soon as we're free.

14488|2018-10-17|13:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/japan-anime-piracy/| News | Anime | Japanese Protection Against Piracy is About to Get a Whole Lot Stronger | Next year during the next regular session of the Japanese Diet, the Agency for Cultural Affairs aims to introduce legislation that will ban so-called leech sites -- those that provide only the links to sources hosting pirated anime, and not direct download links to the media itself. |These days in much of the Western anime market there are a whole lot of options when it comes to legally enjoying our favorite medium and the dozens of shows it produces each season. The same rings true in Japan, where companies like the largest mobile data provider NTT Docomo has its own streaming service. However, this hasn’t stopped either segment of the market from engaging in an alternative, “free” method of consumption, though the punishment of providing the content illegally and for no yen at all is about to get a bit more severe in Japan. Next year during the next regular session of the Japanese Diet, the Agency for Cultural Affairs aims to introduce legislation that will ban so-called leech sites -- those that provide only the links to sources hosting pirated media, and not direct download links to the media itself. This legislation will actually be an addition to a pre-existing bit of legislation, the “Copyright Act.” Any of those indicted under this new proposition could face anywhere from three to five years in prison. In 2017, police arrested nine suspects under a certain pretense of the aforementioned Copyright Act; their site was not playing host to the pirated media itself, but merely links to pirated works, and thus serves a sort of precursor to this current effort. “Well then, how were they able to actually arrest people?”, you may ask -- by claims from the Association of Copyright for Computer Software, which alleges that the site in question, “Haruka Yume no Ato,” caused about 73.1 billion yen (or $640 million US dollars) in lost sales. The previously mentioned NTT has voluntarily blocked such “leech sites” from subscribers of its own internet services by request of the government, which has sought to reduce piracy of anime content as early as September 2017. These efforts however have been met by legal action from a court in Saitama prefecture, which argues that the movie is in violation of the “Telecommunications Business Act,” which has been set in place to dissuade ISPs from censoring any sort of communication. In fighting this suit, the Japanese government will argue that this extension of piracy certainly harms content creators to the tune of about 7.5 million US dollars a year. With the advent of easy and affordable, yet myriad streaming options for anime content, it will certainly be interesting to see how authorities the world over will regulate the distribution of this massively popular and ever-growing segment of entertainment media. But at the same time, maybe this should also be seen as the turning point for a few other practices in the industry, especially when it comes to the pricing of physical content nationwide.|Piracy, anime piracy, Anime Torrent
14493|2018-10-17|12:00||http://otaquest.com/sound-voltex-vividwave-impressions/| News | Music , Games | SOUND VOLTEX VIVIDWAVE Location Test Impressions | We made our way over to Kawasaki to try out the limited-time location test for the upcoming SOUND VOLTEX expansion, VIVIDWAVE. |If you have gotten comfortable with the futuristic themes of an intergalactic space war between Raisis and Grace in SOUND VOLTEX, I hope you’ve gotten over it, because now, we’re going to the Idol Stage. This is Sound Voltex VIVIDWAVE (Not to be confused with the similar looking font of Hachioji P’s album VIVID WAVE). As a fun side note, this is the first SOUND VOLTEX game since the original SOUND VOLTEX BOOTH to not feature a roman numeral after the title, so you can add that to the list of visual departures too. We made our way to Silkhat Dice in Kawasaki near Tokyo to check out the location test. The tickets to play are given out as a random number which we were not as lucky as we were with the Beatmania IIDX26 ROOTAGE location test, where we got number 27. This time, we drew...156. By 3 in the afternoon, the person who drew number 65 was able to play. So with that being said, we didn’t get to play -- but we got to see a decent amount of the action. A harsh departure from the visually pleasing aesthetic of sharp angles, moving pieces, and overly futuristic looking interfaces, we are now presented with an extremely pink and white interface, a la SOUND VOLTEX II – Infinite Infection, which is still visually appealing, but different. This time around, we’re presented with angular text, which is very reminiscent of the font used for Beatstream II, we’re also presented with characters placed on the screen during mode selects (complete with breast physics), through to the song select screen which is quite simply an updated version of the song select screen we’ve come to grow and love from SDVX3 and SDVX4 only this time, there are some new options so you can access from the song select screen such as your note speed and judgment offset. There have also been some new sorting functions added as well. Upon inserting your coins you’re presented with the standard ‘E-Amusement Pass’ login. Once you’ve authenticated, you’re asked if you wish to transfer your play data to SOUND VOLTEX VIVDWAVE. Once this has been completed, you’re on to the mode select screen which is when the changes begin. On the mode select screen, you’re presented with a character, which I could at this time only assume is your selected ‘Navigator’. This feature was not implemented on the Location Test build, so it displayed characters at random. The character takes up the left half of the screen, and your modes being displayed on the right half of the screen. Previously, you were presented with ‘Light Start’, ‘Standard Start’, ‘Blaster Start’. On the location test build, we were presented with a new kind of start, titled, ‘Vivid Start’. Vivid Start was described as 2 songs, and 1 Automation Paradise. This brings us to the next new implementation on VIVIDWAVE. Automation Paradise – Quite possibly the most surprising new addition to the game, it is a randomly generated setlist of 3 songs from a predetermined list which have been mega-mixed together. On the location test, there was a handful of songs which were ‘Automation Paradise-ized’ all of which were pre-determined at 180BPM, which we’ll list below: Absurd Gaff good high school Gott Max Burning!! Onigo Ray 香港功夫大旋風 BLACK or WHITE? choux à la crème HAELEQUIN XROSS INFECTION 2 MINUTES FIGHTERS Innocent Floor NEO GRAVITY REVOLVER ΑΩ ロンロンへ ライライライ！ 上海紅茶館 ~ Chinese Tea Orchid Remix ヤサイマシニンニクアブラオオメ In regards to new tracks, there was not a huge amount of tracks that were present on the Location Test build of the game, unlike the recent location test of Beatmania IIDX26 ROOTAGE, there were only 9 new songs in the game, 2 of them coming from recent album releases including Camellia’s new album "GALAXY BURST" and lapix’s new album "L". We also are graced with the Pop Team Epic theme as well as the return of Sampling Masters MEGA, and longtime BMS artist ‘paraoka’. However, with such a small new song list being available at this time, we can only assume that the release won’t be coming until after the beginning of 2019. Upon selecting your track, you are presented with the new gameplay interface which is very similar to what we’ve experienced in previous SOUND VOLTEX games, however this time, the background of the play area looks to be what you would grow akin to seeing at idol shows with multiple colored Lumica light sticks and a grand stage behind the playfield. Once completing your track, the result screen displays a similar large character display with your grade ranking directly next to it in a large font with your play stats displayed as well. While we didn’t get to play the game directly ourselves, we did get to spend some time basking in its glory, and needless to say, we’re impressed in what we saw. All in all, SOUND VOLTEX VIVIDWAVE is shaping up to be what looks to be an interesting addition to the franchise and is appearing to try to reach a more mainstream crowd. As always, we will be on top of the upcoming announcements regarding SOUND VOLTEX VIVIDWAVE.|SOUND VOLTEX, Sound Voltex Vividwave, Vividwave, Sound Voltex Vivid Wave, ViViD WAVE, Bemani, Konami, SDVX

There's so much reason to celebrate, from high-fashion collaborations to 2 upcoming games for Nintendo Switch, it seems like we can't keep Nintendo's colorful creatures out of our news feed due to everything going on! We're sorry for those of you who aren't fans, we just can't contain our excitement as massive fans of the franchise. Today is no exception with a new trailer dropping for the upcoming Let's Go Pikachu & Let's Go Eevee titles, a TCG collaboration of highly artistic proportions, and now some fantastic news from Niantic for players of Pokemon Go! Starting this morning, 20 new monsters from the Sinnoh region have been added to the game, thus officially welcoming the 4th generation of Pokémon to the AR gaming behemoth. With 107 new creatures to collect from the region, it's pretty clear that this is going to be a staggered release and that might be due to the nature of the Pokedéx for this region. Generation 4 features 22 new evolutions for previously released pokemon, 6 new baby forms, and a whopping 9 legendary/mythical creatures. Some of the Pokémon from this region also have the same kind of variation quirks that have resulted in some previous generation Pokemon to be delayed significantly from the initial introduction of their generation (Kecleon from Generation 3 still isn't available for example). 20 doesn't really seem like too small of a number when you consider the primary mechanic of evolving in Pokémon Go requires a lot of repetition, and with 9 of the new entries being the starters it actually ends up being less new things in the wild to catch. In fact, most of the new pokémon found in this batch are evolution versions, meaning you're really only likely to see 7 of them frequently until they roll out more. There are also 2 new regional exclusives (Chatot & Carnivine), which means even more reasons to travel as well! None of the previous generation evolutions are available just yet either, but with the amount that is included in this generation, there's no better time to start stocking up on candy to prepare yourself. As a pretty dedicated Pokémon Go player myself in the recent months, the timing of this new wave of Pokémon is perfect. I've found that Niantic has done a fantastic job as of late keeping the game fresh and engaging with the multitude of new features that have released this year, and with more new creatures to collect (and from my favorite generation no less) I'm more excited than ever to get back out there and continue my journey to be a Pokémon master.

Titles Receive New ‘Adventure Awaits’ Trailer | Nintendo earlier this week released a new trailer for Pokemon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokemon: Let’s Go, Eevee! with the slogan 'Adventure Awaits!'. |While I was skeptical at first as to whether or not I'd be looking forward to the upcoming Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! titles on Nintendo Switch, I'm honestly pretty excited. With every new trailer, every new little bit of information, I find myself cozying up to the concept just a little bit more -- but this latest trailer hit the spot real good. Uploaded to Nintendo's YouTube channel earlier this week, the latest "Adventure Awaits" trailer showcases some familiar faces, legendary pokémon, and more. Bridging the worlds of Pokémon GO with the long-running handheld series of Pokémon titles, the upcoming Let's Go games have a lot going for them. Introducing two-player gameplay, new movement systems, and for the first time ever being available on Nintendo Switch, the Let's Go games will ultimately serve as the ideal bridge for new fans from the mobile game to get into the mainline series when the new title drops in 2019. With that being said, it's also looking like some legitimate fun for old fans too, and I can't wait to get my hands on it. Recent times have seen a revival for Pokémon GO not just in Japan, but in other parts of the globe too, bringing eager trainers from all around back into the game -- myself included. While it's difficult to say that it's in direct correlation to the upcoming Nintendo Switch titles, I'm sure there's a large enough percentage of people who recognize that everything they're working on now will all pay off when the Let's Go titles release in a months time on November 16, 2018. Now let's see how much of my Pokédex I can fill out before then. If you're looking to join in on the adventure yourself, we're giving readers a chance to win one of 2 Nintendo Switch bundles with exclusive Let's Go Pokémon theming & goodies too!

Following a number of teasers posted on new age idol unit CY8ER's various SNS accounts, we got our first look at the group's collaborative efforts with Galaxxxy, calling on and remixing one of the brand's most iconic looks of the last few years. Utilizing Galaxxxy's late-2015 "Manga Jacket" design, the new-look piece is fittingly coming in five color variants, one corresponding to each member of the group, and features CY8ER's logo in place of the former katakana text. In addition, you'll notice that the actual canvas has been changed entirely, opting for a range of parka's rather than the prior heavyweight down jacket. 【 galaxxxy × CY8ER 】 ??????????? 詳細後日 ???????????#CY8ER #galaxxxy pic.twitter.com/5rwDd7sdQ7 — CY8ER (@CY8ERinfo) 15 October 2018 The whole redesign is honestly pretty tight, and is entirely fitting of a group so forward thinking about the clothing they both perform in and shoot in. The collaboration makes plenty of sense too, especially given CY8ER's predecessor BPM15Q filmed their most successful music video, "Hakuchuumu", head-to-toe in Galaxxxy gear all the way back in 2016. There's currently not too much info on the collaboration outside of the shared imagery and videos, with the post from CY8ER's account stating that we can expect to hear more soon. Until then, those interested in checking out even more on CY8ER and their incredible library of music can head over to the group's official website.|CY8ER, Galaxxxy, Cyb8er Galaxxxy

Gracefully blessing our feeds with some seriously substantial repeat value, we found ourselves blessed with "Cityscape" from newly formed two-person unit Applekid. Now, just three months later, we're finally seeing the fruits of Applekid's labor, coming in the form of their debut EP "PLENA" which was shared earlier today again via Maltine Records. Having spent a good twenty-four hours with a release, I seriously can't get over just how stand-out the whole EP truly feels. From the glistening highs of opening track "Cityscape" all the way to the punchy vibes provided by "Marble", there's so much that Applekid did right on this one. It's not an overstatement when I say I've had "Marble" on repeat all day, both in front of the PC and while strolling around outside, it's just that good. We had our first clue that this was going to be something special when "Cityscape" dropped earlier this year, but I don't think anyone could have seen this coming. I mentioned it the last time that I wrote about Maltine Records, but it still rings true so I'll say it again -- the last year hasn't seen the same volume of releases we've seen from the netlabel in the past. With that being said, it really does feel like the overall quality of these releases are at the highest point they've been for some years, and I certainly can't complain about that. Those interested in checking out Applekid's debut EP "PLENA", it's available for free download via Maltine Records' official website.|Applekid, Maltine Records, PLENA, yuigot, Seana
14480|2018-10-15|17:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/pokemon-edvard-munch/| News | Games | Pokémon Meets Artist Edvard Munch in Limited-Time Collaboration | Western art contemporary Edvard Munch has us screaming over these upcoming Pokémon collaborative items, including some seriously rare cards. |For anyone looking to enjoy a little bit of art appreciation here in Tokyo, making the quick trip over to Ueno Park is easily the best bang for your buck. Playing host to no less than six museums covering a wide variety of artistic ground -- from traditional Japanese art and sculpture to Western and contemporary art -- you could easily spend a day or more losing yourself in the Northern Tokyo district. I’m not sure how large a portion of our audience is exactly clamoring to go to an exhibition featuring 19th-century Norwegian expressionist painter Edvard Munch, but I am confident that a huge part of our crowd does, in fact, adore Pokémon. With that being said, I’m here to say that you should definitely consider checking out the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum this coming November, December, or January. That's a statement that'll especially ring true if you’re a big fan of the Pokemon Trading Card Game and some potentially rare cards. With Pokémon retaining its status as one of the biggest pop culture phenomena of the 21st century, it’s easy to appreciate a significant artistic collaboration that spans centuries. With Munch’s iconic The Scream as a motif, the exhibition will feature five limited edition cards and two card storage files, as seen above and below. My favorite part of each individual piece of artwork is the ominous shadowy Pokemon sneaking up behind Pikachu, Eevee, Psyduck, Mimikyu, and Rowlett, causing them all some sort of existential dread (well, except Mimikyu I guess; they look the same as ever). There is a slightly different method for obtaining each individual item. To get your hands on Mimikyu, you’ll need to purchase one of the files, as it comes included in the package. They go on sale at the museum and at Pokémon Centers across Japan on October 27 and will cost 450 yen each. For Eevee, Psyduck and Rowlett, you’ll first want to pick up two High Class expansion packs, at which point you’ll be able to pick your favorite at the register as a freebie. Finally, as for Pikachu, well, that information is coming at a later date. Will it be the rarest card of all? Munch: A Retrospective is running at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum from October 27 until January 20. You can find more information on that exhibit here, and more information on the goods here. And hey, it looks like you don’t even technically have to go to the museum to get the goods, but really, I’m sure a bit of that “art appreciation” wouldn’t hurt every now and then! |Pokemon, trading card game, Edvard Munch
14479|2018-10-15|16:00||http://otaquest.com/supergroupies-code-geass-pyjamas/| News | Anime | SuperGroupies Collaborates With 'Code Geass' on Sleepy New Line | Shibuya-based clothing brand SuperGroupies has teamed up with 'Code Geass' to produce a new line of themed sleepwear. |Lelouch vi Britannia has certainly spent a lot of time resting after his "death" at the end of Code Geass R2, and I’m sure there’s some among us who’ve wondered if he did so in some stylish pajamas. But even though Lelouch will presumably be rising once more for the upcoming theatrical film Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection, those interested in getting a little sleepy with Lelouch may want to check out the latest collaboration between the series and Shibuya-based anime fashion label SuperGroupies. This latest Code Geass-themed addition to the already impressive SuperGroupies line up has a lot of great pieces, such as Code Geass-themed handbag and Code Geass-emblazoned bracelet, but what initially caught my eye was the pajama set. Coming in at just over 10,000 yen, it not only allows fans to express their love for the series while lounging but is also based on some official art of Lelouch in his pajamas. Check it out below: Pajamas are an absolutely essential part of my wardrobe, and although I’ve accumulated some questionable items for my lounging purpose over the years, this pajama set is sure to attract attention for all the right reasons. It utilizes a tasteful combination of white fabric as well as gold buttons with a black trim, accented with a wing-design trim around the collar and the name ‘Lelouch vi Britannia’ emblazoned on the breast pocket. And while a majority of the design focuses on the upper half, the bottoms of the set also feature a small Geass pattern near the waistline. This is certainly one of the nicest pairs of pajamas I've seen in a long time, and given that Code Geass will be returning very soon - next February, in fact - perhaps now is the best time to show your love for the series. You can check out more details on the pyjamas, as well as the full Code Geass collection here. |Code Geass, SuperGroupies
14478|2018-10-15|15:00||http://otaquest.com/world-trigger-shonen-jump-return/| News | Manga | ‘World Trigger’ Returns to Shonen Jump After 2 Year Hiatus | After two years of absence, the Daisuke Ashihara’s much-loved 'World Trigger' manga series will be returning to the pages of Weekly Shonen Jump. |It’s been a long two years, but Daisuke Ashihara’s World Trigger is finally returning to the pages of Weekly Shonen Jump. Starting in 2013, World Trigger quickly rose to be one of the magazine’s most popular series, even receiving a long-form anime relatively early into its life cycle in 2014. It seemed to be nothing but success for the series, until the author suddenly announced a hiatus for the series, on account of serious spinal injury as well as general poor physical health. For fans, it’s undoubtedly been a period of frustration as well as alienation, but Shueisha seems to have enough confidence in the continued existence of the series’ readership to bring it back after such a long time. I also have no doubt it’s been a tough time for Ashihara, who essentially had to give up everything because of his health and at the height of his career. That being said, he’s not taken the lessons of the hiatus lightly, as he drew a comment for the announcement promising that he would take better care of his health going forward. Check it out below: The announcement also revealed that the series will move to the monthly Jump SQ magazine after five more issues in Weekly Shonen Jump, which can only be a good thing for Ashihara’s health. The environment of weekly serialization is tough enough for fit and healthy mangaka, and I have no doubt that the stresses of such an environment only served to antagonize Ashihara’s long-standing health problems. But even if Ashihara’s health problems can be solved, or at least alleviated, the question still remains: will he be able to pick up the series again? Two years is an awfully long time for a story to remain idle, and it would be difficult to grasp all of the plot threads in the long-running series for any mangaka, let alone one tormented by the problems of physical health. That’s to say nothing of the problem of readership, in that it’s certainly not guaranteed that fans will return - after all, a lot happens in two years. Some of them might have even stopped reading manga entirely. Either way, World Trigger will return to Weekly Shonen Jump in two weeks, on October 29 or issue 48 of the year. It will presumably be published for English readers in VIZ’s English-language Shonen Jump, as VIZ currently holds the license for the series, having translated all of the currently released volumes.|World Trigger, Daisuke Ashihara, Weekly Shonen Jump, Shonen Jump, Jump SQ
14481|2018-10-15|14:00||http://otaquest.com/sword-art-online-arcade-2019/| News | Anime , Games | ‘Sword Art Online’ to Release First Arcade Game Spring 2019 | Sword Art Online is making its grand arcade debut in 2019, though it won't be making use of any special VR or AR equipment. |Whether you love or hate Sword Art Online, you’d be hard pressed to deny the massive success it has enjoyed over the years. It has spawned three anime series, one of which is currently airing, as well as a spinoff series in Gun Gale Online, along with more than a couple of home console and mobile games. So when Bandai Namco Entertainment announced their plans to release a Sword Art Online arcade game last week, it was quite a big deal. The arcade game will be titled Sword Art Online: Deep Explorer and is planned for release across Japan in the spring of 2019. The title promises to reunite players with their favorite characters in top-down action gameplay. Much like other popular arcade games at the moment, such as Kantai Collection and Fate/Grand Order, players will not only earn characters in-game but also in card form. This allows players to maintain a physical representation of their progress in the game, as well as of course facilitating selling and trading between players. There’s not much information beyond that as of the time of writing, but quite a bit can be inferred from the trailer itself. Firstly, the amount of ‘Touch’ prompts that appear lead me to think that the game unit will utilize a majority touchscreen instead of a separate controller like Fate/Grand Order or Kantai Collection, meaning that the game may end up looking more like the touchscreen MOBA Wonderland Wars than anything else. This would be great for the arcade game landscape, particularly arcade RPGs, as so many titles have followed in the footsteps of the massive success of Kantai Collection Arcade and replicated the control scheme. Some tiny text at the end of the trailer also confirmed that the game will be playable locally with up to three people, which is an absolute godsend given that so many arcade games these days only support single player, with Taiko no Tatsujin being one of the last great side-by-side cooperative arcade games. There’s real potential for this game to flourish as a cooperative title, especially since most people know of the series. Furthermore, online play will be supported, although in what form it will be utilized remains unclear. It’s hard to overstate the massive weight that the Sword Art Online name wields, so it’s worth paying attention to this game’s development and eventual reception when it releases in the spring of 2019. But regardless of whether the game is any good or not, one thing is for certain - lots of people will be flocking to the arcades to give it a go, which will earn Bandai Namco a lot of money in the process. |Sword Art Online, Arcade, Sword Art Online Arcade, Bandai Namco
14476|2018-10-15|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/sega-global-release-2020/| News | Games | SEGA Wants to Release Games Simultaneously Worldwide by 2020 | In their most recent financial report, it was revealed that SEGA aims to localize and release games simultaneously around the globe by 2020. |Japanese gaming giant SEGA has been making strides over the past couple of years in bringing their releases to fans across the globe as fast as possible, but it's looking like those tight release timeframes are about to close completely. In the company's latest integrated report, it was revealed that SEGA is planning on localizing and releasing games simultaneously across the globe within the next two years as part of their "Road to 2020" project. Throughout the integrated report, SEGA praises the localization work of Atlus as a key component in maximizing the global entertainment of their video games through incredible localizations that have come to be revered by game enthusiasts around the globe. It's shared that currently development assets are being shared for translation before development is complete, but SEGA wishes to tighten the timeframe in which this is shared with the aim of reaching that goal of simultaneous global releases. The full excerpt can be read below: There is one more key factor that explains the brisk sales overseas. Before a Japanese game is released overseas, it is localized into the language of each country and region. For example, Persona 5 has been translated into three languages (English, traditional Chinese, and Hangul). No matter if a game is popular in Japan, it is unlikely to win over fans around the world if the localization is insufficient. The Sega Group has localization studios that make a huge difference when games are sold overseas. Atlus became a member of Sega Group due to the transfer of business in 2013, which has a studio located in California, U.S.A. The studio understands both Japanese and American games very well, and is able to localize Japanese games in a way that accurately conveys the unique world views of Japanese titles to local gamers. The studio is able to maximize the entertainment value of localized games that reflect these unique world views, and this has led to very positive reviews from local gamers. During the product development stage, game content is shared with the localization team for translation before the development is finished, facilitating the rapid release of foreign language versions of the game. We will strengthen such collaboration further with the aim of simultaneously releasing games around the world, which is an objective of Road to 2020. Having just finished playing through Yakuza Kiwami 2, the desire to move onto the upcoming PlayStation 4 remaster of Yakuza 3 is understandably killing me, so hearing that SEGA wishes to close the release gap globally is definitely welcome news. Though the title released in Japan on August 9, 2018, there's been no official word of a release date for the West, and with the upcoming JUDGE EYES set to release sometime in 2019, it'll be difficult to outline just when it actually will arrive. Additionally, the integrated report detailed numerous statistics about some of SEGA's best-performing IPs and outlined how the company wishes to proceed throughout the next few years. Those interested in checking into those statistics, some of which see titles such as Yakuza reach a total of 12 million sales, can be found here. Source: Gematsu|Sega, Yakuza

When news broke over the weekend of the idol's retirement, I can't say I was too surprised -- rather, I was relieved that after nine years of intense on-stage performances and live shows, Yumemi Nemu could finally embark on the life previously out of reach under the pretense of being an idol. Even though my favorite member of a group I had been following for over seven years was leaving, I can't help but feel joy. いつも応援してくださる皆様へ pic.twitter.com/rteyp7za4G — 夢眠ねむ (@yumeminemu) October 13, 2018 Within the span of her awe-inspiring nine-year career Yumemi Nemu did everything from live shows to television and even at one point became her own Vocaloid. She was the embodiment of some of the best aspects of Akihabara culture and was extremely outspoken in her own interests. From her early days as a DJ and eventual performer at the aforementioned Club MOGRA, where her imagery still hangs to this day, all the way to some of her most recent ventures including her 2017 book "Hon no Hon", if Nemu wanted to do it, she'd find a way. In early 2017 we saw the departure of Moga Mogami from Dempagumi.inc in a bid to pursue a more personal solo career. This departure would ultimately become the catalyst for a much larger change within the structure of Dempagumi.inc, introducing two members from sister group Niji no Conquistador, Rin Kaname, and Nagi Nemoto. To call either of these two replacements for any member of the group would be an insult to their own talents, both Rin and Nagi are seriously good; with that being said, they weren't brought in without a reason. It's hard to know how long departure from the group has been on the mind of Yumemi Nemu. In her announcement, she states that not only will she be "graduating" from Dempagumi.inc, a term commonly used in the idol industry to describe the departure of a member, but also that she'll be retiring from the entertainment industry as a whole. That's a commitment with some serious weight to it and not something you can truly decide within such a short period of time. Following her retirement, Yumemi Nemu shared that she plans to open her own bookstore -- something you likely saw coming following the release of her book "Hon no Hon". In addition to this, she also plans to continue focusing on developing the brand of her original character "Tanukyun", a character you'll commonly find adorning stores such as Village Vanguard and more. It's not over for Yumemi Nemu just yet though, with the idol set to continue activities until her grand finale at Nippon Budokan on January 7, 2019. Following that event and her official "graduation" from the group, Nemu will be continuing media activity until the end of March 2019 where she will then officially retire from the public eye. There have been no changes announced for the upcoming releases of Yumemi Nemu's debut solo album, "Yumemi Jidai", on November 21, nor to the upcoming Dempagumi.inc album "WareWare wa Dempagumi.inc da" on January 1, 2019, so we have every reason to remain excited, even if its slightly bittersweet, for those two releases. From the start of her career until the very end, Yumemi Nemu has offered us as fans more than we could ever ask for; giving it her all at every possible corner. With her upcoming retirement, I can only hope she is able to enjoy the freedom away from the spotlight that she's worked so hard to deserve, and wish her the best of luck with all of her ventures. Thank you for everything, Yumemi Nemu. |Dempagumi.inc, Yumemi Nemu, Dempagumi, Nemu

As an official license holder for years, the brand has released shirts from both major & niche titles throughout Nintendo's history and does it with a style you're definitely not going to find at Hot Topic. Clean design and clever packaging (most shirts come packaged in a large famicom game-styled box) make King of Games easily one of the top brands worldwide for gamers looking to dress their best. Their latest collaboration with the gaming powerhouse comes in the form of a t-shirt featuring DJ KK from the Animal Crossing franchise. The new shirt features the world-famous DJ and resident of Club LOL on the front, traced out in a neon light pattern. On the back, you'll find the familiar Animal Crossing leaf design in a similar neon tone. What makes this particular release note-worthy is that rather than a typical unisex-only t-shirt, this design is also coming in a printed dolman cut in women's sizing for those who want a wider neckline and a looser fitting top. If you're an Animal Crossing fan and able to do so, I would definitely recommend picking one of these up. I own a few shirts from the brand myself, the quality is amazing and lasts forever. The Mother/Earthbound series shirts I picked up back in 2006, in particular, are still in fantastic shape to this day. While they have in the past offered international shipping, it currently appears to be unavailable while their official website is under reconstruction. Tokyo Otaku Mode carries some of their designs in their shop, so in the meantime, we can hope that they pick this one up for international customers too! More information about this particular shirt, as well as a Japanese ordering page, can be found at the Editmode online shop.|Animal Crossing, DJ KK, King of Games, Nintendo, Collaboration

14460|2018-10-12|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/maison-book-girl-golden-record/| News | Music | Maison book girl Announces New 'Golden Record' Project | Maison book girl earlier this week launched their all-new 'Golden Record' project, calling on producers from around the globe to remix their biggest tracks. |There are few groups in Japan worth keeping your eyes on more so than the four-piece unit Maison book girl, especially in the current musical landscape. It truly feels like most everything they touch ensues a breeze of fresh air into an otherwise stagnant industry, and their recently launched "Golden Record" project is no exception. Calling on talent from both Japan and abroad, we see artists bo en, Tomggg, and Hakushi Hasegawa remix some of the group's biggest releases. Each and every remix shared thus far perfectly blends the artistic values of both the remixer and Maison book girl in a unique and enjoyable way that has me totally hooked. Every time I find myself listening to Tomggg's remix of "Faithlessness" I'm transported to a totally different mental space, with his signature dreamy sounds whisking me away -- not that you could expect any less. With bo en's megacrazymix of "Veranda" I feel like I'm losing myself in some of my favorite PlayStation 1 titles right in the midst of a rave, all while Hakushi Hasegawa's remix of "Last Scene" takes us in a very different direction filled with twists and turns. It's currently uncertain as to whether or not we'll be seeing the "Golden Record" project expanded upon, but if it was I wouldn't be too surprised. With the launch of a Twitter account and website for the project during the month of August, it'd be almost crazy not to do so -- though common sensibilities have never quite defined Maison book girl in the past. With the group's new album set to release in Japan on November 21, we're sure this won't be the last time we'll be seeing Maison book girl, and that's honestly the best news I've seen all day.

The announcement came today via a blog post on the PlayStation website where it was revealed that the feature is currently entering beta testing on PlayStation 4, as well as the fact that PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita users will not have access to the functionality. Detailed in the announcement, those who opt to change their names will get one free name change, and the proceeding changes will cost $4.99 for PlayStation Plus subscribers, and $9.99 for non-subscribers. Additionally, games released after April 2018 and a handful of high-performing online games released prior will support name changes, though Sony warns that non-supported games might throw errors at users who have changed their name. While it seems that changing your name may bring with it a few unexpected issues, Sony is offering name reverts free of charge for users -- but you've got to wonder why this is happening in the first place. It has also been announced that Sony will be producing a list of compatible games that won't offer any problems with name changes when the beta launches. Those wishing to change their name following the service launch, everything can be found in your PlayStation 4's setting menu. While it might not be the most impressive feature rollout in Sony's long history, it is quite possibly one of the most requested, so I'm sure we won't be seeing too many complaints.

Well, today we finally saw this program spring to life with the long-established netlabel's latest "TREKKIE TRAX :branch Vol. 01" compilation which dropped via the TREKKIE's official Bandcamp account. Featuring 15 different unique talents, you're not going to be seeing any names you're likely familiar with -- but that's the point. In TREKKIE TRAX' eyes, these 15 candidates are the future of electronic music, and this is undoubtedly just the beginning. TREKKIE TRAX :branch Vol.01 by V.A The whole compilation does an incredible job of bringing together numerous genres together under the TREKKIE TRAX name, with sounds represented from Japan, Australia, USA, Canada, and more, all flawlessly slotting into the six-year legacy of quality crafted by the netlabel. While it's honestly quite difficult to single out any one or two tracks, I've found myself enjoying both "4+1" by niafrasco, as well as "October" by Technokoutarou on repeat since release. It's not just these two tracks, however, but each of the 15 pieces that build this compilation are genuinely incredible and leaves me excited to see how these next few years pan out.

14449|2018-10-10|16:00||http://otaquest.com/metal-gear-sold-hd-xbox-one/| News | Games | ‘Metal Gear Solid HD Collection’ Comes to Xbox One Backwards Compatibility | The much-praised Metal Gear Solid HD Collection has today snuck its way onto Xbox One via the console's ongoing backwards compatibility program. |Fans of Hideo Kojima’s madcap series Metal Gear have been clamoring for a way to play the series’ back catalog for years now on current-gen consoles. In particular, fans have been vocal in their wish to have the series’ seminal entry, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, remade in the Fox Engine for the current generation of consoles, which is definitely possible considering that Konami have already remade many of the game’s cutscene with the Fox Engine for a pachinko game. But while there’s no movement on that front, great news came today as Xbox announced their addition of the Xbox 360 release of the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, which includes remastered versions of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Snake Eater as well as the PSP title Peace Walker and the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake MSX titles, to their ever-growing library of Xbox One backwards compatible titles. Not only will this provide newer fans to the series a way to experience the older games on the newest hardware, but will allow those fans who sold their last generation consoles to play the HD remasters once more. It’s also worth noting that, as of the time of writing, there’s no way to play the same PS3 version of the HD remasters on the PS4, due to the system’s lack of backward compatibility and not being available on PS Now, a service that allows those who pay a subscription to stream previous generation titles over the cloud. This is despite the PS3 release of the HD collection being more substantial, including Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots along with all of the others. Furthermore, with the PS4 being one of the only viable home consoles in Japan at the moment, Konami may end up missing out on potential re-engagement with the series in its own homeland. So with this announcement, it’d be easy to say that Xbox is now the best place to play Metal Gear. Yet, Metal Gear Solid 4 was developed as an exclusive for the PlayStation 3, because of the superior storage capacity of Blu-ray discs that only Sony was using at the time - meaning that the Xbox is missing out on a key mainline entry in the series. Given that it’s not only my favorite game in the series but also the most character and story-intensive of them all, it’s a bit of shame. But for those who do own an Xbox One and want to dive back into the some of the best entries in the series, or perhaps have always wanted to give them a try, then this is the perfect opportunity. Happy sneaking!|Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid HD, MGS, Metal Gear Solid HD Xbox One
14448|2018-10-10|15:00||http://otaquest.com/code-geass-movie-trailer-1/| News | Anime | ‘Code Geass’ Movie Receives First Trailer, Unveils February Premiere | Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection earlier this week received its first trailer ahead of its much-anticipated February 6 theatrical release in Japan. |I can still hardly believe it, but the story of Code Geass will be continuing next year in an all-new theatrical film titled Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection. And while I had my reservations at the time of the announcement as to how much the story could really flourish in such a limited environment, as opposed to a full-length TV series, the first trailer for the movie has me seriously excited for next February. The first thing that is revealed by the trailer is that the events of the movie take place two years after the Zero Requiem. Not only is this an essential piece of information, but given that this is a remarkably short period of time, it’s safe to say that the world we will see in the movie won’t be that much different from the world that we last saw in R2. Furthermore, most of the characters won’t have had much time to age, essentially making my dream of having Lelouch go on an adventure in his old age, much like Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4, very unlikely. We also learned a little bit more about our antagonists this time around, which should help us to determine the overall course of the movie’s plot. The original announcement trailer for the movie showed us what looked to be a Geass-using young boy with a visor, and he appears once more in this trailer - cementing his probable role as the principal antagonist. We also finally got a name for this character from the official press release - Shario. Not the most menacing of names, but I’ll take it. Another antagonist was also confirmed, the country of “Jirukustan,” meaning that our protagonists will not only get the chance to face off with another Geass user but another mech army. Hell yeah. There also seems to be some kind of link between the Geass users and the country as suggested by the way that both of their reveals are placed next to each other and in quick succession. We’ll have to wait and see to confirm whether that’s true or not, but for the time being it’s safe to assume they are working as one. Their aims are, rather predictably, to hunt down Zero and Nunnally. But what interests me is if they are assuming Lelouch is still under the Zero mask, and the fact that they have lumped Nunnally and Lelouch together - possibly suggesting that there may be some sort of familial motive to their aims. That certainly wouldn’t surprise me, as the question of Lelouch’s family and particularly his mother Marianne still remains unresolved, along with the nature of the Geass power itself. We end the trailer with Suzaku in some dire straits, looking to have been tortured and left hanging on some chains. The text on the screen also declares the “Defeat of the Strongest Knight” - begging the question of who will come to the rescue. And as much as the promotional material for the movie will most likely try to hide it, there’s no way in hell that Lelouch won’t be the one to do it. It’s called Lelouch of the “Resurrection,” after all. Either way, we’re only one trailer into the promotion of the upcoming movie, and I’m already very interested to see where it goes. Luckily, I won’t have long to wait, as the trailer also confirmed that Code Geass: Lelouch of the Ressurection will open in Japanese theatres on February 9.|Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection, Code Geass, Lelouch of the Resurrection, Lelouch
14447|2018-10-10|14:00||http://otaquest.com/yugioh-toriko-shonen-jump-return/| News | Manga | ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!’ and ‘Toriko’ Creators Return to Weekly Shonen Jump | Two veritable legends of the manga industry are making their return with the announcement that both 'Yu-Gi-Oh!' and 'Toriko' creators are returning to Weekly Shonen Jump. |As much as I’m loving the various events and announcements dedicated to celebrating the legendary Weekly Shonen Jump’s 50th birthday this year, I have to admit that Shonen Jump wouldn’t be where it is today, at the top of the manga game, without the tireless efforts of the mangaka that have produced so many classics for the magazine. With that in mind, it’s great news that two veritable legends of shonen manga are returning to their spiritual home of Shonen Jump to pen some short series in celebration of the magazine’s 50th birthday. The returning legends are none other than Yu-Gi-Oh! creator Takahashi Kazuki and Toriko creator Shimabukuro Mitsutoshi -- even though the two are generations apart, they've both penned some of Shonen Jump’s greatest hits. Don't get too excited too quickly, however; Shimabukuro will only be returning for a little while with a short, six-page story titled “My First Bring-Your-Own.” What the title refers to exactly is somewhat of a mystery, as what exactly Shimabukuro is “bringing” could easily be manga or beer. Even so, Jump describes the series as related to Shimabukuro’s own debut, so I’d imagine it will revolve more around manga. I’m certainly fascinated to see what the short series will be like, as Toriko is bursting with inventive ideas and creative flair. Plus, seeing how Shimabukuro - who is now a veritable legend - made his debut will not only be interesting but also inspiring to the next generation of mangaka who have no doubt enjoyed Toriko since it’s conclusion in 2016. Considering that Jump is constantly looking to the future for that next mega-hit -- especially given that One Piece could end in a generation -- I hope that the short can touch the hearts of at least some readers. Another series that I’m sure has touched the hearts of many up-and-coming creatives, as well as the current generation of mangaka, is Yu-Gi-Oh!. I don’t think I need to justify the massive cultural impact that the series has had, not only in Japan but all over the world too, as it introduced an entire generation to the world of trading card games and an iconic cast of characters. The series’ creator Takahashi Kazuki has been relatively inactive ever since the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga concluded in 2004, only resurfacing in 2013 for a one-shot in Jump titled ‘Drump.’ And while Takahashi will not be returning to the manga world completely, his new series titled “The Comiq” will be serialized in the “short term.” We can expect to see up to seven chapters for this new series, as I have no doubt that Shueisha will be wanting enough material for a takonbon volume release. Details on the series are few and far between, but we do know that the main character is called Genkou and that he has some kind of “secret” that we will no doubt uncover throughout the run of the series. Also, it will focus on the art of manga (just as the title suggests), so expect Takahashi to be pulling from his own experiences - just like Shimabukuro will be doing as well. Having both of these legendary creators back within the pages of Jump seems like another fitting celebration for the magazine’s 50th birthday, and I can’t wait to see what kind of stories they turn out to be. Both series will be published in the October 15 issue (no. 46) of Weekly Shonen Jump.|Weekly Shonen Jump, Shonen Jump, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yugioh, Toriko, The Comiq

Since I first started following つづつ and their works as a designer, illustrator, and animator, they've made it no secret that they're a fan of France-born producer Moe Shop's late-2017 single "Charm w/ Puniden", and today they revealed their latest project in the form of a fan-animated music video uploaded to YouTube channel Waifu Wednesdays. Best known for his hyper-elongated animation style and diversely unique color palettes, つづつ has us completely floored with his animation work here. Seeing the original cover character from Moe Shop's "Charm" spring to life is something that's undeniably surreal, and the unique flare provided by つづつ's original character is totally fitting for the song. With the incredible Latin-inspired instrumental vibes from Moe Shop, Puniden's gorgeous vocal work, and the hyper-focused animation work of つづつ, this fan-animated music video most definitely has a whole lot going for it. Made available via Tokyo-based YouTube network-gone-label Waifu Wednesdays, it's exciting to see their broadening scope with the ever-present connectivity of Western fans in the Japanese music and animation scene. We're sure this won't be the last time we see content like this from つづつ, and that's honestly got me more than just a little excited. Their unique charm is something worth keeping an eye on, and we can't wait to see how they continue to innovate.

Its one of many releases from these last few months that have had some sort of tie-in to an additional form of media, ultimately casting an even broader net to showcase the numerous styles m-flo is capable of tackling. Vibing like an 80s groove with that iconic m-flo styling, "Piece of me" can be streamed below: Following on from the success of LDH's flagship HiGH & LOW franchise, we saw the announcement of an all-new multimedia project by the name of PRINCE OF LEGEND just a few months ago. Following the story of Kanade Suzaku, as he's thrust into the Prince of Legend competition that takes place at his prestigious school once every three years, the drama series aims to determine just who the ultimate prince truly is. Fourteen princes battle it out, with both a television series and film underway, with the latter slated for a 2019 release. m-flo's latest single, "Piece of me", will act as the theme song for both.

Given the time of year, it only makes sense that a holiday that's quite literally known for delightfully devilish sweets and equally rotten tricks, that Family Mart would introduce a limited-time "Russian Roulette" variant of their standard nine-piece pack of bread rolls. Easily on a whole other level of "trick" over "treat", the "Russian Roulette Bread" from Family Mart is set to provide some seriously entertaining situations. Contained within the nine pack of bread rolls you'll find four chocolate-filled rolls, four cream-filled rolls, and a single wasabi tartar sauce roll that's sure to leave a sour taste in your mouth. I haven't had a chance to try the game out myself, but reports from those who have suggest that the burn of the wasabi tartar isn't too extreme, but it's definitely not the most comfortable feeling. When it comes to "Russian Roulette" food games, Japan is absolutely no stranger -- takoyaki roulette being a commonplace at just about any college izakaya run. Made available as of today at Family Mart locations across Japan, the "Russian Roulette Bread" is going to cost you a cool 369 yen before tax. Whether or not it'll outlive Halloween as a limited-time item remains to be seen, but given its clear-cut Halloween themed packaging, I can't imagine this bread will stay fresh through November.

It should be obvious that there's been a high-level of hype amongst us since the album was originally announced last month, but our excitement actually predates even that -- let's flashback to September 8 to a little party known as Violently Cute. Taking place at Club Asia in Shibuya, this event would ultimately be the test bed for what would later be known as "Time Capsule," the latest collaborative track from both TORIENA and Yunomi, and what a track it is. Uploaded earlier today to TORIENA's official SoundCloud account, the track is the perfect blend of both Yunomi and TORIENA's production values, with TORIENA's iconic vocals layered over the top. It's a small component of what will otherwise be a wide array of styles featured throughout the playtime of "SIXTHSENSE RIOT", but none-the-less it stands out incredibly on its own, sounding equally impressive when performed live as it does from the comfort of your own room.

Given how fast things moved at that event, and what resellers are already asking for on many of the pieces on eBay, it would be amazing to see an additional quantity of many of the primary pieces in the collection be available at the pop-up. I for one would love to get my hands on the black shirt with the running Pikachu silhouette, which I missed out on this weekend.

They're a guaranteed pull for customers, and fans go crazy for the limited-time menus and exclusive goods made available at these cafes. IKEA Japan has obviously been paying attention to this trend, and this Halloween, they intend the jump in on this action with a limited-time spooky new menu featuring some interesting takes on their standard dishes. Flipping a small selection of some of IKEA Japan's most popular dishes, we see an all-new pitch black curry, pitch black hotdog, and pitch black monster ice cream. Additionally, other items such as desserts and pastries will also be getting the pitch black treatment, so it'll be interesting to see how they all hold up following the slight color changes. The promotion will be running throughout the month of October and will be available at all IKEA's nationwide until Halloween is officially over. IKEA Japan isn't the first company out here to try their hand at creating pitch black recipes, with Burger King Japan's classic 2014 "Kuro Burger" being a prime example. That isn't to be confused with the Burger King black burger that came out in North America in 2015 though, as we all know how that turned out for the unfortunate hordes of people who tried the burgers out. With prices remaining at the same 200 - 300 yen price point they've always been at, I might just end up spending my Halloween this year locked away in an IKEA instead of the streets of Shibuya -- yeah, that sounds nice.

From the pages of Weekly Young Magazine between the year 1982 up until 1990, all the way to the streets of Shibuya with gorgeous murals wrapping construction sites, its impact is something not to be forgotten -- especially not with next year being so important to the series. Available for one day only, exclusively at Hypefest in New York and GALLERY X by PARCO in Shibuya, the limited-edition AKIRA 2019 Calendar is everything we could have ever wanted. Taking all of the manga's original strengths and leaning into the values of high-design, the AKIRA calendar is possibly the cleanest center-piece money can buy, especially with it coming in at a larger-than-life B0 size. Originally priced at 13,000 yen (roughly $115 USD), the calendar was limited to 2019 pieces split between both Shibuya and New York, though I can't imagine that stock lasted long. Those who managed to pick up the calendar at Hypefest will have received some bonus stickers, while the people who got their hands on a piece at GALLERY X by PARCO received a pin badge. I'm uncertain of just how much these are going to resell for, but I'm only hoping I'm able to get my hands on a piece before we enter 2019.

14430|2018-10-05|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/eureka-seven-anemone-trailer/| News | Anime | Anemone: Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution Receives New Trailer, US Release Announced | The latest trailer for the upcoming Anemone: Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution film began streaming earlier this week, and Funimation made the announcement that it'd be coming to the West. |Following a major update to the official website for Anemone: Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution earlier this week, the upcoming second entry into the Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution trilogy of films received an all-new trailer. Featured throughout the trailer, we see the animated film's theme song, "There's No Ending", as performed by 15-year-old Japanese middle school student Ruann. Not only that, however, but it was also revealed at New York Comic Con that Funimation would begin a theatrical run of the film in the United States during 2019. The latest trailer can be streamed below: Feeling like a total departure to the first entry in the Hi-Evolution trilogy of films, Anemone: Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution is looking to pave dark new paths for the franchise within the confines of Tokyo. As the film's title suggests, the second entry will follow Anemone as she fights back against the Seventh Eureka, otherwise known as Eureka Seven. The film will also prominently feature the NIRVASH X, a major overhaul of the original series' main unit in a much larger body. Set to begin screening in theaters across Japan from November 10, 2018, the upcoming entry into the Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution trilogy has me genuinely excited. With the basis of the original story detailing out of the way following the first entry into the trilogy, we can't wait to see the original offerings put forward in Anemone: Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution. While we don't know when Funimation is planning on beginning their screenings in 2019, one could only hope it'll be before the third film releases in Japan that same year.

Applied for on March 16, 2018, the patent showcases a clam-like device shell that would add Game Boy-like features to your device, and most likely, allow you to play Game Boy games while you're at it. Details on the patent are currently quite unknown. Showcased above, the casing would utilize special touchscreen-friendly material beneath the buttons to register input on the screen, and it's presumed that the game would display exclusively within the screen cutout at the top half of the case. While the diagram would appear to showcase a smartphone device, there is wording within the patent that suggests its usability on other electronic devices -- the Nintendo Switch for example. While I can't quite picture Nintendo suddenly offering their own classics library on either Android or iOS, it sure would make a lot of sense on the Switch and could make excellent use of handheld mode. Recent times saw the launch of official NES controllers for the Nintendo Switch, so maybe a touchscreen-friendly cover/controller for the device wouldn't be so far-fetched at this point. It's also not uncommon for companies to simply patent ideas for the sake of keeping their properties locked down, but here's hoping this actually become something interesting. Those interested in checking out further details, Siliconera has gone into a bit deeper details over on their original discovery piece on their official website.|Nintendo, Game Boy, Gameboy, Game Boy Mobile, Game Boy Switch, Switch, Nintendo Switch
14418|2018-10-05|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/marvelous-tanoc-wacca-announcement/| News | Music , Games | MARVELOUS & HARDCORE TANO*C Announce New Rhythm Game 'WACCA' | Announced earlier today, MARVELOUS has brought on the team at HARDCORE TANO*C to co-create their latest arcade rhythm game 'WACCA'. |It's by no means a secret that within our writing staff there's quite a unanimous respect for rhythm games and their extensive history. With that being said, it's always exciting to see new pockets of innovation appear in the ever-developing rhythm game landscape, and MARVELOUS might really be onto something with their latest announcement. Originally teased with a countdown website just a short while back, both MARVELOUS and legendary doujin label HARDCORE TANO*C are teaming up to produce an all-new rhythm game, WACCA. Easily being host to some of the most prominent rhythm game producers, HARDCORE TANO*C has been publishing incredible releases year after year. From talents such as REDALiCE to DJ Genki and so many others, the announcement that they'd be producing their own rhythm game is certainly no small deal. I'm sure many of you are already familiar with MARVELOUS, they're the developers behind titles such as Senran Kagura in Japan -- but I'm equally sure you don't know them for rhythm games. That's because WACCA is actually the developers first time working on a title of the sort, and what a great start they're off to already. Previewed in the teaser trailer above, WACCA seemingly positions itself somewhere between Mai Mai, Chuunithm, and Sound Voltex in its gameplay style. Utilizing a full-360 degree touchpad around a center screen, players will find themselves tapping and sliding on numerous notes to climb up the gradings. There's yet to be a release date announced for when this title will be hitting arcades, but MARVELOUS has announced that they'll be operating location tests across Japan from October 19 - November 4, 2018. Over these last few months, we've seen the release of a number of new rhythm games including SEGA's latest ONGEKI, but this title, in particular, is partial to both anime and idol music. This most certainly does appeal to a certain niche, especially those coming from mobile rhythm games such as Love Live! School Idol Festival and Bang Dream!, but it likely won't appeal as much to core rhythm gamers who are in it for the original music and excessive mappings they're paired with. It might just be the case that WACCA will be the perfect alternative for those people, with most of HARDCORE TANO*C's artists already being prominent talent in other rhythm game titles. Those interested in checking out even more on MARVELOUS' upcoming WACCA arcade rhythm game title, be sure to head over to the official website.|Marvelous, WACCA, Hardcore Tano*C, TANO*C, Rhythm Game, New Rhythm Game, Redalice

14410|2018-10-04|20:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/hiroshi-fujiwara-pokemon-interview/| News | Games | Interview with Hiroshi Fujiwara: Thunderbolt Project, Culture, and Design | We sat down with design & style legend, Hiroshi Fujiwara, to discuss fashion, cultural changes, and his upcoming collaboration with Pokémon. |There are few figures from Japan who carry as much global significance in mainstream culture as Hiroshi Fujiwara. Considered in some circles to be the godfather of ura-Harajuku culture, he has a long-storied history in the worldwide streetwear scene and is seen by many as an influencer in the most literal sense. From his work as a brand owner, independent designer, and even as a tastemaker in the fashion industry, his presence has been felt through collaborations with some of the biggest brands in the world including Louis Vuitton, Nike, and Levis. Most recently he has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to bring the world "THUNDERBOLT PROJECT BY ◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️ & POKÉMON", a collaboration of the highest caliber with one of the world's most recognizable franchises. We were given the opportunity to sit down with him ahead of this weekend's Hypefest event and chat, and as a longtime fan of his work I couldn't help but jump at the opportunity. Continue reading below to see his thoughts about streetwear culture, the internet's impact on the industry, and his upcoming collaboration. OTAQUEST: Thank you for sitting down with us today, as a longtime fan of your work I appreciate the opportunity to have this conversation. To start things off, many of our readers in America who aren’t familiar with the Japanese streetwear scene may not be familiar with you or your body of work. How would you describe yourself and your design philosophy to someone who isn’t already familiar with your work? Hiroshi Fujiwara: I’m not good at explaining myself, but I started DJing in the early 80’s and I was really inspired by punk music. I think many people don’t realize that punk and hip-hop have very strong connections, and I was really into that scene. It was the whole culture, music and fashion, which might not be as connected anymore but back then it was a really strong moment for both and I was growing up with it. OTAQUEST: You started your career in fashion with your clothing brand, GOODENOUGH, and in the early 2000s you shifted from that to being very focused on collaborations with the founding of fragment design. What do you like about the creative process that occurs when collaborating with others? Fujiwara: I wasn’t really trying to create a collaboration brand or anything, because there was a time where collaboration wasn’t really necessary. No one really cared. It was just based on my friendly relationships with different companies. When I visited New York my first time in 1982 I went to the Tiffany store, because I liked the movie (Breakfast at Tiffany’s), and there was nothing I wanted to buy but there was a Montblanc pen and Rolex Watches. I wondered to myself “Why are they selling these, they are not Tiffany products”, so I asked the staff and they told me that they recognized Rolex as the number one watch brand and Montblanc makes the number one pen so they decided to carry them. They included a Tiffany logo, and I thought that was a really great concept. It was one of the first collaborations like that which I saw. Then when I was doing GOODENOUGH I always carried a PORTER bag at the time, so I called up their company and asked if I could make a bag. That was the start of collaborations for me. I continue to try to do the same kind of thing, if I like something then I’ll ask the company to either make something for us or if we can do a collaboration. If they say no then maybe I’ll just make something similar by myself. But basically, when I stopped doing GOODENOUGH I became really independent and decided I would rather just work with other people and companies to do that kind of collaboration product. OTAQUEST: You’re known as a key player in bringing hip-hop culture and streetwear to japan. Being that you have been around that scene since the beginning how do you feel it’s different now? What are your thoughts on how the culture has evolved over the years? Fujiwara: I think information technology changed so much. Now you don’t have to go anywhere, you don’t have to travel. That’s a really big thing. I think the mindset is still the same though, people want to be the first to get a new product and want to get things that are very rare. The mentality is all the same. OTAQUEST: Do you think the design process or the type of work that comes out now has changed over the years? Fujiwara: Maybe it became bigger, but not really changed. OTAQUEST: So in relation to that, is there anyone or any company operating currently who’s work you enjoy right now in either music or fashion? Fujiwara: I really enjoy everyone, UNDERCOVER, NEIGHBORHOOD, LOUIS VUITTON, etc. They all have their own mind and their own originality. So I’m really lucky to get to work with them, and maybe steal ideas sometimes *laughs* View this post on Instagram new hoodie #thunderbolt_project #streetstyle #fashionsnap #ootd #fragmentdesign #fragment #hiroshifujiwara #藤原ヒロシ #pokemon #pikachu #ポケモン #ピカチュウ A post shared by THUNDERBOLT PROJECT (@tb_project) on Sep 21, 2018 at 2:09am PDT OTAQUEST: In the past you have said that you feel the internet has taken the experience out of shopping and searching for stuff, and you’re the type of person who has done some very creative pop-up stores like THE POOL and what you’re doing currently with THE CONVENI. Do you think that because of the way the internet has changed behavior that creating an experience is really important in your own work? Fujiwara: Yeah, I think so. You have to go there or be there in person to really get the whole experience. OTAQUEST: Do you think that changes the consumer mindset in doing so? Fujiwara: I really hope so. But you kind of have to explain that you have to be there. People think “I saw it, so I was there” when in truth they only saw a small picture online. Like even The Louvre in Paris, if you go there are so many things to see. Even if you only see the Mona Lisa in person, it’s still different that just seeing it on the internet. I think you really have to go there and feel it. OTAQUEST: Does that thought about the experience influence your work at all? Fujiwara: Yeah, I don’t really know how to explain how but I really enjoy doing it. THE CONVENI for example is actually a difficult project, it’s really hard work because you have to keep thinking about what’s next. For example this is a new thing I’ve done *pulls a small coin out of his bag* It’s Bitcoin chocolate. Bitcoin melting in your mouth *laughs*. I had read that the Bitcoin design is public domain so I thought it would be cool to make. This kind of thing is really fun to do. I also don’t really think so much about when I’m working with a company on a collaboration about how I can make something bigger or sell a ton of product. I just want to give a different image to them, so it doesn’t have to be a huge project, just something different.

Fujiwara: Yeah pop-culture I think was really finished in the 90’s. OTAQUEST: From my perspective I’ve noticed that as of late younger audiences have had a fascination with time periods that they never had a chance to experience themselves. One that I find to be really interesting is that Bubble Era & City Pop music has been really prominent in the west. A good example is Mariya Takeuchi’s “Plastic Love”. It wasn’t a huge hit when it first came out in Japan but right now it’s all over YouTube and has millions of plays, and it’s helped inspire a genre of music called “Future Funk” that’s been growing worldwide. Do you feel this kind of false nostalgia is creating a different kind of pop-culture then? Fujiwara: Yeah I think so, it (revival culture) was always kind of like that. Before the internet it was harder to search for things but it was always like that. I’m glad to hear that something like Japanese city pop music is seeing a revival, because I never thought the concept of a true revival was ever going to come back again. It’s really good to know. OTAQUEST: In the past you’ve talked about the idea of treasure hunting when it pertains to different cultures & experiences. Knowing now that City Pop has had a chance to flourish in another country, do you think that the internet has created a different kind of treasure hunt? Fujiwara: Yeah, but maybe-not in the most positive way. You’re not really going somewhere to do the treasure hunting so maybe it’s lost the atmosphere and impacted the way people travel. But then again, it’s something else so it’s not actually positive or negative. When I was traveling around I would think “If I find something I want, and I have the money then I really have to buy it, because I might never see it again”. But now if you wait like 3 months you can find anything on eBay all the time, so it’s kind of losing the what made that buying experience special. In terms of distance, I think it’s like the distance between someone & eBay is no different than the distance between me and my closet. If I have a pair of Jordans in my closet it might take several hours to find them, and it’s a pain in the ass. But then there’s eBay, so if I want something again I can get it easily. OTAQUEST: Do you think that concept of “nothing is really exclusive anymore” has changed the way that people consume fashion now, in the sense that a lot of brands will make things very limited to keep the demand high? Fujiwara: Well, you say very limited but I don’t think it’s really like that. Maybe now Nike can make 10,000 pairs of sneakers and someone will still say it’s rare, but that’s not really the case is it? OTAQUEST: That’s true. But there’s also a movement, and it’s always kind of existed but I think it’s probably more apparent now than it used to be, where people will buy collaboration items or rare streetwear items and they’ll keep them unused and display them. Almost like appreciating fine art. What do you think about that kind of mentality? Fujiwara: I kind of understand, because I’ve always been like that. Maybe the tastes are different but I’ve always had that kind of otaku mind. I want to collect, or maybe not really collect, but keep things if I really like them. So I understand if people buy Supreme or something like that and just want to keep it. OTAQUEST: Do you think that’s changed how designers create though? Like maybe some people are looking at their work in fashion as being more like art, rather than specifically fashion. Fujiwara: I don’t know, I hope not. Personally, if I buy something I want to wear it or use it. OTAQUEST: Considering things like THE CONVENI or your recent work with LOTTE’s Bikkuriman, you’ve collaborated on a lot of different products over the years, and of course you’re known for fashion. Is there any medium you haven’t had a chance to work in or a product that you haven’t designed that you want to have an opportunity to try your hand at? Fujiwara: I would love to design something like one floor of a luxury hotel. OTAQUEST: There’s been a trend in the west lately where a lot of Japanese properties have been used for collaboration recently. Supreme did Akira, Adidas is doing Dragonball. What do you think about that idea of using something born from Japan that might not be as well known to the mainstream for a collaboration, and do you think it’s a trend that will continue? Fujiwara: It’s not like Japan is so “Far East” anymore. It’s really part of the international scene now so it’s bound to happen. It’s the same as us using Mickey Mouse or Snoopy, instead it’s Akira or Hayao Miyazaki. So I think the idea is very similar now.

Fujiwara: The Pokémon Company asked me if I was interested in doing a collaboration, and I wondered “What can I do for Pokémon?” I saw Pikachu and its theme is thunder or lightning. So I thought, I can use my logo for Fragment with things like the Pokémon tails, and then I got back to them and we talked about it. OTAQUEST: Were you familiar with the franchise or played any of the games prior to them reaching out to you? Fujiwara: Yeah, I had been playing Pokémon Go a bit. OTAQUEST: Since you play Pokémon Go what do you think about the Augmented Reality experience it provides? Fujiwara: I didn’t know much about Pokémon before I started playing it, but as a game Pokémon Go is amazing. Using the latest technology and incorporating it into a game that anyone can pick up and play, I think that’s amazing to be able to go anywhere and catch what you want. OTAQUEST: Do you think there’s an application for AR in fashion? Fujiwara: Yeah definitely, I’ve always wanted to do that kind of orientating thing. It never happened, but I wanted to something like that with Nike using all of the Nike stores around the world. Something that would have made you go to many locations and scan a QR code to see how many you could visit. It may be on a different scale, but it’s kind of the same thing with Pokémon Go. You really have to go all over the world to catch everything. OTAQUEST: Is there something about the Pokémon franchise that you think lends itself to doing a streetwear or high fashion collaboration? Fujiwara: I think there’s a lot of potential with it. I’ve been asked by a few luxury brands about using Pokémon characters, so I think it’s similar to Mickey Mouse or Snoopy in that way. I wasn’t really sure if I would use Pokémon for myself, I had never thought about wearing something with Pokémon, but once I did it I was happy with the result. I kind of surprised myself *laughs* OTAQUEST: You’ve collaborated with so many really famous brands in the past but most of them were fashion or lifestyle oriented and Pokémon is more of a pop-culture icon in a different way. How does the experience in collaboration with a high end fashion property differ from working with something like Pokémon? Fujiwara: I think of it more like hitting a balance, if you do something really high fashion then it’s good to do something like Bikkuriman or Pokémon. It didn’t really change how I approach the design, I just though it was something I needed to do. I really like so many different things. OTAQUEST: You mentioned Pikachu earlier as an idea that inspired your designs but are there any other characters that you think have an interesting design? Fujiwara: This project will keep going on for maybe like 2 years, so we have a lot more to come. OTAQUEST: You’re on the board for Hypefest, and I thought it was really interesting that they reached out to represent the Japanese side of fashion especially since streetwear is so prominent in America and there are already so many brands to work with. What was the process like working with them to select who to include for the event? Fujiwara: Kevin (Ma, founder of Hypebeast) had asked me to be a member of the board, along with Sarah (Andelman, of colette). I don’t quite think the idea was about being tired of the same things, but I think they just wanted to bring something else to the event. Maybe not everything at hypefest will be what real street kids want, it’s not specifically just sneakers or anything like that, it’s more about sharing fashion and culture. OTAQUEST: So maybe it’s like the idea of forcing people to leave their comfort zone? Fujiwara: Yeah, I think that education is really important and also interesting. To know what’s behind street culture, or really what’s going on right now in different places. OTAQUEST: Talking about Hypefest in relation to THUNDERBOLT PROJECT, and about the idea of education and bringing things that people might not expect, was there a specific thought process behind using Hypefest as the place to debut your collaboration with Pokémon? Fujiwara: It was really just the timing. When Pokémon had asked me to do it I had Hypefest going on as well so I asked them if we could debut it there. It was just perfect timing. OTAQUEST: Do you have a hope for what the response will be for something like this at Hypefest? Fujiwara: Surprise. I like to surprise people. OTAQUEST: What can we look forward to seeing from you next? Or is there anything you’re working on that you’re excited about? Fujiwara: I’ve been working with Moncler, that’s a two year project, so there are a few more collections I’m doing. I have a few projects with other luxury brands in progress. Steiff, the Teddy Bear, that’s really cool and coming out next month. We'll be following Hiroshi Fujiwara's exploits down the line in full here on OTAQUEST, starting this weekend with the multiple activities he has going on at Hypefest in Brooklyn, New York.

14412|2018-10-04|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-switch-new-model-2019/| News | Games | Report: Nintendo to Announce a New Switch Model for 2019 | Reports shared today by the Wall Street Journal suggest that the Nintendo Switch may be getting a slight upgrade in 2019 to keep the console's sales on the rise. |Just two years into the lifecycle of the Nintendo Switch, reports have begun to surface that Kyoto-based gaming giant Nintendo is already conceptualizing an upgraded version of their hybrid console to hit shelves early 2019. The news comes from The Wall Street Journal's Japanese staff, citing suppliers and insiders as their source on the knowledge. It's reported that in a bid to keep up with the enormous sales that took place in the console's first year, Nintendo will begin offering a slightly upgraded version with potential changes such as a more efficient screen to keep the momentum moving. Potentially ready to ship as early as Summer 2019, it remains to be seen just what changes will be introduced to the console; reports suggest, however, that it will remain in-line with the original Nintendo Switch and won't replace it. While the spec bump is expected to see an all-new screen fitted into the console, it's worth noting that the report also details "The updated Switch isn’t expected to adopt the organic light-emitting diode or OLED panels", so it might be more realistic to expect a potential boost to 1080p over the current 720p screen. Between the dates of launch until June 30 this year, the Nintendo Switch saw tremendous sales of over 19.7 million units. While Nintendo has some highly anticipated first-party titles, including Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Pokémon: Let's Go!, lined up for the remainder of 2018, it'll be interesting to see what Nintendo is able to bring to the table to make new fans want to buy the upgraded version of the Switch, or more importantly, how they'll get current Switch owners to double down.

14409|2018-10-04|00:00||http://otaquest.com/persona-5-casino-kabukicho/| News | Games | Persona 5 Invades Casino in the Heart of Kabukicho | Atlus' fan favorite Persona franchise is taking over Shinjuku with a casino collaboration in the heart of the area's Kabukicho district. |Anime collaborations are some of my favorite things to come out of the proliferation of otaku culture into the mainstream in recent years, as they not only allow fans a way to interact with their hobbies beyond buying merchandise but also often lead to hilariously mismatched pairings. One of my favorite in recent years was the Gundam x Coco Ichibanya collaboration, in which diners could win a curry themed Gunpla model kit and Gundam-themed curry spoons, among other unintentionally hilarious goods. But none have made me chuckle more than the recently announced collaboration between Atlus’ Persona 5 and, well, a casino. Obviously, collaborating with a casino isn’t that out of the ordinary once you consider that one part of Persona 5’s story takes place in a casino - indeed, the official website states that the collaboration is intended to celebrate the casino arc of the series being recently aired during the anime adaptation of the original game. But casinos aren’t exactly the kind of place you’d usually find otaku - especially when the casino is right in the heart of Kabukicho, Tokyo’s red light district. “AMUSEMENT CASINO JiQoo” will be playing host to the collaboration and will be offering lots of goodies to fans of the series if they come and visit. First-time visitors will receive a special Persona 5 themed members cards (the casino is members only and requires registration), and can order a wide variety of Persona 5 themed drinks, such as the “Navi Fresh” themed after Futaba Sakura and “Queen Ginger,” themed after Makoto Nijima. Each drink will also bag you an exclusive coaster chosen at random from a pool of nine different types. Of course, it wouldn’t be a casino without some games to try your luck in, so there’s even a Persona 5 game on offer as part of the collaboration - a special dice game that will be themed after dice that actually appear in the casino arc of the series, which visitors will be able to play alongside the staples of blackjack, baccarat, roulette, and poker. It’s worth noting, however, that because gambling is illegal in Japan, you won’t actually be able to exchange your chips for anything like you would in a regular casino. As the name suggests, all the games are simply for amusement - provided you like that kind of thing, of course. The collaboration is currently underway at JiQoo’s casino in Kabukicho, Shinjuku until October 21, so if you’re a fan of Persona and would like to participate in one of the strangest collaborations I’ve seen in a long time, then definitely check it out. They seem to welcome foreign visitors, as much of their website is available in English as well as Japanese, so not knowing the language may not be much of a problem either.

The final Hideo Kojima-directed Metal Gear game was panned at release by fans, formed a large part of a campaign against the game publisher’s (Konami) shocking business practices, and left what had been a legendary series on a rather sour note. That sour taste still lingers in many fans’ mouths, and to some, that update was a rude reminder of a memory best forgotten - and yet, MGSV refuses to die. In many ways, it’s hard to blame fans for being disappointed. The promotional material for the game promised many things, and it failed to deliver on many of those promises. Firstly, the game was supposed to show Big Boss’ transformation from a man to a “demon,” and therefore how he would become the antagonist that we first encountered all the way back in 1987’s Metal Gear. Secondly, in showing Big Boss’ descent to the dark side, it was supposed to serve as “the missing link” between the two halves of the franchise - those being the Big Boss games, and the Solid Snake games. But more importantly, it was supposed to end the series on a high note, after what had been a mostly positive 30 years of releases. Yet, Big Boss was largely static as a character throughout the game, and seemed to act more like a hero than a “demon” - one mission even saw you go out of your way to save several child soldiers. Really, if there was any character that we truly saw become a “demon,” it was Kazuhira Miller - who would go on to betray Big Boss to work for FOXHOUND later in the series anyway. And even though the promise of “the missing link” was addressed in the game’s meta ending, this was executed in such a poor way that many fans were left unsatisfied - with some even believing that the true ending, or the true “missing link,” lay waiting to be uncovered. As a result, MGSV’s story sticks out like a sore thumb in the midst of the deftly woven narratives of previous games. All of this meant that fans were very disappointed, to say the least, and frustration at the game was only heightened due to how well the game scored during pre-release reviews. Critics from all corners of the internet were giving the game perfect scores, calling it the best game in the series yet, and with the hype this generated, it’s only natural that fans felt frustrated and betrayed. It would only later be revealed that the critics playtested the game in a “boot camp”, only being given a short amount of time to complete what would end up being a 100 hour plus game for those aiming for 100% completion, which didn’t allow them to encounter the major story developments in the second chapter that disappointed so many fans once it was available for general release. No doubt, if time wasn’t so limited for the reviewers, they may have come to much different conclusions - perhaps ones that more actively expressed the flaws in the game’s story. It’d be foolish to suggest that such a move wasn’t intentional on Konami’s part, who knew full well that the game story was being cut short to rush development forward for an earlier release. Konami is no stranger to such practices, and the treatment of their employees working on MGSV only reinforces their willingness for shady business practices. Several sources close to the company came forward to talk of their mistreatment by the company during the development of the game, with Japanese broadsheet Nikkei detailing the Orwellian practices put in place by the company to monitor its employees (https://kotaku.com/report-konami-is-treating-its-staff-like-prisoners-1721700073), and American YouTuber Super Bunnyhop detailing a series of leaks sent to him via an anonymous source (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMK-kajdgMA) - which only seemed more viable once Konami tried to take down the video. And although Kojima himself has stayed quiet on the subject, he’s not exactly denied it either - and sometimes silence speaks louder than words. Konami’s frankly disgraceful treatment of their employees fed into the outrage surrounding the disappointment of the game, as now fans had a viable target towards which they could direct their hate - but it’s not as if Konami was acting the villain on purpose. Rather, rushing development was a natural course of action for the company to take considering it’s financial state at the time. Not only were Metal Gear games becoming less and less profitable, but this game was also costing more and more as the game stretched out for five years of development, including the development of a new in-house engine called the ‘Fox Engine.’ Considering that the game wasn’t even finished after the eventual five years of development, imagine how much longer it would have taken to fully complete to Kojima’s standards - that was simply something the company couldn’t take, especially since it was hemorrhaging key staff and IPs left and right, including the mastermind behind Castlevania, Koji Igarashi. So while I won’t condone Konami’s harmful policies towards their employees, strawmanning the company for the game’s flaws wouldn’t be accurate, either. But it is a reality that Konami was made into a strawman immediately after the game’s release, and as a result, Hideo Kojima was painted as the victim in all of this. And while he definitely was affected by Konami’s practices, Kojima also has to take his share of the blame in sowing the seeds for disappointment among fans. He has always had an eye for flashy PR through trailers, and it was from these trailers that the ‘promises’ fans expected to be fulfilled emerged. Of course, he probably expected to be able to finish telling the story he set out to tell in full, but perhaps creating such lofty goals for himself as presenting the “missing link” between 30 years of video game history was a bad idea in the first place. Even now, Kojima’s ambitions threaten to get the best of him as he builds anticipation for his upcoming title Death Stranding through flashy trailers alone, leaving many frustrated that we still don’t have any specifics on the title, nearly 3 years after it’s announcement. In another sense, perhaps it was foolish to try and give the Metal Gear series a proper ending, anyway. In fact, Kojima has developed every game since Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty to be an end to the series, and each time he came back for a sequel, he only ended up complicating the series’ timeline further. That came to a head in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, which bombarded the player with lengthy cutscenes in an attempt to sort out its own timeline and put an end to the series once and for all. In this sense, while it is incredibly flawed, Guns of the Patriots is the closest thing to an ending that the series has seen. It even features a “missing link” between the Big Boss and Solid Snake storylines in the epilogue of the story - already fulfilling one of MGSV’s promises. In addition, when it comes to how Big Boss become a “demon,” the precedent for this was clear in the epilogue of Metal Gear Solid 3: Peace Walker, following the emotional impact Big Boss’ betrayal left on him, as well as the player. This, therefore, begs the question - was there even any need MGSV to serve as an “end”? I’ll admit, I was one of those infuriated fans back in 2015. I’d played through the whole series again in preparation for that September 1 release, I woke up at 4 am to begin the download on Steam, and woke up promptly at 7 am to play it for almost 15 hours straight before my eyes could take no more. I was shocked by the ending, by the game’s broken promises, and the whole thing meant that I couldn’t even take one more look at what had once been one of my favorite franchises of all time. But that update changed everything - I realized that the game was still alive. I reinstalled it and found myself surprised. The game was not dead. Despite the bad press and fan backlash, it was still being updating and had more content now than it did on launch. Even though Konami have been made out to be the bad guys in the past, they haven’t done anything bad by MGSV post-launch. The servers still run, they still update it, and events are still going on. Far from abandoning the game, they have continued to stick by it and deliver on the gameplay that the critics were so enthralled by, back in the days of the boot camp. Metal Gear Online was even added, which while I’ve never been a big fan of, represents a sizeable dedication of time and resources into a property nearly universally loathed by its fanbase. Or is it universally loathed? Just taking one look at the MGSV modding scene challenges that notion. It’s one of the most active communities on the Nexus mod site, with the Snakebite mod manager allowing easy development and installation of mods - many of which iron out the glaring gameplay flaws of the vanilla version, refining what was already a solid gameplay experience. Online multiplayer in the form of FOBs still goes on, with fans still striving to rid the world of nuclear weapons and trigger the hidden “PEACE” cutscene. Konami has helped keep this mode alive as well, thanks to the constant events that they schedule and organize. All of this is because, at its core, MGSV is a good game. It might not have the best story, particularly compared to other entries in the series, but it’s gameplay still makes it the best game to play in the series, and one of the best stealth games ever made. There’s endless replayability to it, whether it be through trying to S rank every mission or completing a European Extreme, no tranquilizer, no kills run, or just simply trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons. In this sense, it’s not hard to see why MGSV lingers on. The aforementioned 2GB update was innocuous enough, simply adding Quiet as a playable character for FOB invasion. But for me, who was blinded by the flaws in the game’s story, it was a wake-up call. MGSV is a damn good game, and because of this, it will continue to linger on - despite everything.|Metal Gear Solid, Phantom Pain, Hideo Kojima, Konami
14396|2018-09-28|13:00||http://otaquest.com/kaiji-tonegawa-hancho/| News | Anime , Manga | Kaiji Spinoff 'Tonegawa' Gets Jacked by 'Hancho' | While Kaiji spinoff series 'Tonegawa' has been enjoying its time in the spotlight, it looks life fellow spinoff 'Hancho' is taking over. |The announcement of a two cour anime adaptation of Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor spinoff Middle Manager: Tonegawa was certainly something no one expected, especially considering it has been years since Madhouse last touched any of creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto’s works. But while I’ve been enjoying it’s more light-hearted take on the heart-wrenching tension of its parent series, yet another surprise came this week as it was announced that another Kaiji spinoff, 1-Nichi Gaishutsuroku Hancho (Chronicle of a Single Day Release: Hancho), will not only be getting an anime adaptation -- but it'll also be “jacking” and taking over the currently broadcasting Tonegawa. Much like Tonegawa, Hancho focuses on a minor character from the wider Kaiji series to tell a more light-hearted story. Anyone who has seen season two or read the third ‘part’ of Kaiji will recognize the main character of Hancho, and for all the wrong reasons - he is the crooked foreman Otsuki that Kaiji battles against for his freedom in the rigged chinchirorin game, and because of whom suffers so much in the forced labor camp. Rather than following his crooked ways, however, Otsuki’s spinoff focuses more on his exploits when he decides to use his one-day vacation above ground and away from the labor camp. The announcement of a Tonegawa anime that would air over two cours worried me in the first place, considering that not many volumes of the manga are currently released. And although the anime has managed to be relatively entertaining so far, it does suffer from slow pacing in places. Therefore, it wouldn’t surprise me if the decision to adapt Hancho came as production felt itself struggling against the lack of material. That being said, it’s not as if Hancho has a lot of material either - as of the time of writing, only four volumes have been released, which makes me fear that the same problems will only be confounded. That very much depends, however, on how Madhouse plans to adapt the manga, and more concretely, what the “jacking” entails at all. It’s possible that the adaptation will take over the programme entirely, whereas it’s also possible that segments of the episodes will be dedicated to Hancho stories, perhaps even attempting to weave the two story threads together. The second method would be more interesting, but if it is indeed a snap decision, then I doubt the production will have time to do so. Regardless, I’m always happy to see more Fukumoto works adapted for anime, and if the adaptation of Hancho can be as solid as Tonegawa, then I’d be very happy indeed. The only thing that would make me happier is the announcement of an adaptation of part four of Kaiji, the somewhat infamous majohng arc. All of this adapting spinoffs must be preparation for that, right? Right?|Kaiji, Tonegawa, Hancho, Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor, Middle Manager: Tonegawa, Nobuyuki Fukumoto, Chronicle of a Single Day Release: Hancho

I fondly remember plugging blue version into my ice blue colored GameBoy Pocket and turning the power on for the first time. I picked Squirtle as my starter (I always go for the water type), and I began my journey to become the very best. Decades later, just like anime series protagonist Ash Ketchum, I'm still on my quest to "catch 'em all"! p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 18.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Helvetica; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; background-color: #ffffff} span.s1 {font-kerning: none} I'm sure you're saying to yourself "Didn't we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Pokémon 2 years ago?", and you would be right. Pocket Monsters made its grand debut in Japan in 1996, but in the west we weren't graced with the franchise until the fall of 1998. The wait was worth it though, North America was treated to graphically superior versions of the original game, based on the Japanese version of Pokemon Blue. It didn't take long for "pokémania" to sweep the nation either. The formula of catching monsters, trading with your friends, and battling to become the very best definitely had a global appeal. It didn't take long for merchandise to show up everywhere, and once the TCG hit in the following January reports of it being banned from schools for being a distraction followed immediately. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 18.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Helvetica; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; background-color: #ffffff} span.s1 {font-kerning: none} Like many, I was a die-hard the minute I started the games. I bought both versions of everything released, I collected & played the TCG, I even worked for Wizards of the Coast retail as a "Pokemon League Gym Leader" for a couple years in high school. I stayed on board due to the allure of the games, I'm hopelessly addicted to collecting things, and developed a strong love for the characters in every new version (Horsea & Jirachi being my absolute top favorites). As I got older that love didn't wane and my love of the games developed into an appreciation for the metagame. Diamond & Pearl were released for the Nintendo DS and I spent a collective 500 hours playing the two titles before the 5th generation of the series was released. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 18.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Helvetica; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; background-color: #ffffff} span.s1 {font-kerning: none} When the Nintendo 3DS was released the possibilities seemed endless. The franchise received a massive graphical overhaul, and more than 700 monsters were yours to collect in the sprawling world they inhabited. 15 years in and the series was as strong as ever. The entire world was enjoying the games simultaneously being released, internet connectivity opened up interaction in a way we never would have dreamed of in 1998 (when having a link cable for the GameBoy made you a guaranteed hit on the playground), and players of all kinds had something to love about the game's extremely diverse style of play. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 18.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Helvetica; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; background-color: #ffffff} span.s1 {font-kerning: none} In the 5 years that have passed since that time we've been introduced to a world where you can catch Pokemon in the "real world" using AR technology, and an even wider fanbase has clearly been cultivated. Many current players probably don't remember when the games were first released in the US, but they still experienced the same magic that I did when I met Professor Oak for the first time and embarked on my journey. At the end of the day, I think that keeps the franchise alive. I'm excited for everyone who is going to have that feeling of wonder for the first time when Let's Go Eevee and Let's Go Pikachu are released in November, and I can't wait to continue my own adventure as we inch closer to the next generation of whimsical new friends next year! Here's to another 20 years of success and adventure, Pokèmon.|Pokemon, anniversay, Nintendo, creatures, Game Freak, pokemon red, pokemon blue
14386|2018-09-27|15:00||http://otaquest.com/sony-playstation-vita-end/| News | Games | Sony Has Finally Killed the PlayStation Vita | It's been a long time coming, but Sony Interactive Entertainment has finally killed off the PlayStation Vita after a disappointingly unfulfilled life. |It’s been a long time coming, but the PlayStation Vita is officially dead. While fans of the portable system have lived through multiple stages of Sony’s mismanagement and abandonment of the platform, firstly through the lack of exclusives and more recently through ceasing production of physical games, it is now officially coming to end with Sony ceasing production of new units in the last bastion of Vita sales - the company's own homeland of Japan. The news came from an interview with Japanese gaming news site Famitsu who interviewed Sony Interactive Entertainment Vice President Hiroyuki Oda at Tokyo Games Show 2018. When asked about the PlayStation Vita and the company’s support for the platform going forward, Hiroyuki stated that they will be producing new units until the end of 2019, and from then on the company will cease production of the console. He also stated that the company has no plans for a successor. It’s no surprise that Sony is going to complete phase the Vita out of production when you consider that the company had already previously stopped making physical games for the device, and also given that the technology of the hardware now appears to be quite outdated, but to hear that Sony will not even be attempting to create a new handheld is very interesting. It’s possible that the company is simply choosing to focus on their home consoles, the PlayStation 4 and it’s eventual successor, and that’s not unreasonable considering their absolute domination of the market this console generation. First party Sony studios and titles have also been doing incredibly well, with both God of War and Spider-Man being remarkably well received by fans and critics alike, to the tune of massive sales figures. And perhaps since Sony know what it is like to dominate others in a market, they can also see the threat posed by the domination of Nintendo in the portable market. There is a considerable crossover in appeal between the Nintendo Switch and PS Vita, not least because many visual novels are making it’s way to Nintendo’s newest platform, but because both offer portable gaming for the adult market. What made the Vita stand out against the Nintendo 3DS at the time was its provision of adult-oriented titles such as Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Assassin’s Creed: Liberation, which was later bolstered by third-party developers after a lapse in first-party production. But now that Nintendo is widening its appeal beyond family-friendly titles with its portable-home console hybrid platform with the recent ports of such titles as Doom and Wolfenstein: The New Order, Sony had a choice whether to compete or concede - and it seems like they have decided to concede. And perhaps that’s for the best. Both the PSP and Vita have been strange, mismanaged platforms, and unless Sony really has the drive to change their ways, I’m sure that a successor would go the same route. Plus, fans of the platform would be much more unlikely to jump ship given Sony’s history - meaning that perhaps a successor would have been doomed, after all. Even so, it’s still sad to see a platform with such amazing potential slowly die, and while it’s eventual death has been a long time coming, it’s still sigh-worthy.|PlayStation Vita, sony, Playstation, Vita
14385|2018-09-27|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/death-stranding-tgs-details/| News | Games | Hideo Kojima Surprises With Key ‘Death Stranding’ Announcements | During Tokyo Game Show 2018 there was no question to the fact that Hideo Kojima sent the crowd into a total frenzy with a slew of all-new details and a gorgeous trailer. |It’s been two years since Hideo Kojima last graced us with his presence at Tokyo Games Show, and although his appearance at this year’s show was prefaced by an announcement that he wouldn’t have anything new to show, that would turn out to be a bit of a falsehood as he revealed a new trailer for his upcoming PlayStation-exclusive Death Stranding, along with the Japanese cast of the game - which includes some names you may very well recognize. The above trailer is the main talking point of Hideo Kojima’s whole appearance at this year’s Tokyo Game Show, and it’s not hard to see why. From the last trailer at E3 2018, many assumed his elusive upcoming project to be some kind of walking simulator, considering that the trailer mostly featured the protagonist Sam walking around. Yet, this trailer confirms that the game will be much more exciting than that, as a massive beast is unleashed by a new antagonist - which Kojima confirmed after the trailer that you can either “fight” or “run away” from. Interesting stuff. Who unleashes this massive beast is also drawing a lot of attention. Referred to in the trailer as “The Man in the Golden Mask,” this character will be another antagonist alongside Mads Mikkelsen’s previously revealed character. He is also voiced by none other than Troy Baker in the English dub and Satoshi Mikami in the Japanese dub - both of whom played the role of Revolver Ocelot in the Metal Gear series. And much like their time playing Ocelot, they seem to be having a lot of fun here with Kojima’s dialogue - managing to sound both sinister and cool at the same time. Attentive fans were also quick to spot the stealth reveal of Stephanie Joosten in the trailer, another Metal Gear alumni, having played Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It’s only for a split second, but when Sam (Norman Reedus) turns around to face the masked man, you can briefly see a model based on her likeness in the body bag. Furthermore, a tiny flag of the Netherlands is visible - Joosten’s birthplace. This confirms years of speculation on Joosten’s involvement in the project, even if Kojima himself hasn’t outright confirmed it yet. Since Kojima was in Japan, he also took the opportunity to announce the cast for the Japanese dub of the game, which makes for quite a stellar cast list. Kenjiro Tsuda will be voicing the protagonist Sam, Kikuko Inoue will be voicing Lindsay Wagner’s character, Nana Mizuki will be voicing Léa Sydoux’s character, and Akihiko Ishizumi will be voicing Guillermo del Toro’s character, who is subject to change since Kojima has already stated del Toro was merely the model for the character, and will not be ‘playing’ him for the game. Also confirmed was a new character, the ‘boss’ of the organization that Sam works for, who will be voiced by Tommy Earl Jenkins in the English dub, and Akio Ohtsuka will be voicing this character in the Japanese dub. It’s worth noting that Mads Mikkelson’s antagonist character is now the only character without a Japanese voice actor confirmed for the role - which either means the character will be mute or that Kojima simply hasn’t found a suitable voice actor yet. Many of the Japanese cast is Metal Gear alumni, with Akio Otsuka playing the protagonist Snake throughout the series, and Kikuko Inoue playing The Boss as well as Rosemary. It seems as though Kojima simply can’t separate himself from those excellent at their craft, even if some of their time working together may now be painful to remember. But all I can hope is that these excellent voice actors can help elevate the game to be as amazing as the trailers have convinced me it’s going to be.|Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima, Tokyo Game Show 2018, Tokyo Game Show

For that reason, it pleases me to see that they're properly celebrating the milestone 20th anniversary of the franchise, after months of relative silence, with content that is sure to be a throwback for longtime fans of the franchise while giving more recent die-hards the chance to experience the series' long-storied history. Over the next few weeks, they have several announcements lined up, the first of which was dropped on the exact date of DDR's 20th anniversary. The first of 2 things added to the current iteration, Dance Dance Revolution A, is a new song entitled "Show me your moves", which is an obvious throwback to the announcer vocal samples used in every version of the game. The track is an upbeat song that reflects the sound that the franchise is best known for by many players, produced by in-house trackmaker TAG with vocals by frequent collaborator Rio Hiiragi. The track is currently available as an unlockable bonus in the game. Fail screens and warning states are themed #DDR20th pic.twitter.com/7N7LPiR10o — BUCKETS OF TEARS (@yahooeny) September 26, 2018 The 2nd new addition is a huge throwback for the series and something that will definitely be nostalgic for longtime players. A new series of song folders have been added to the game broken up by the different eras and games in the franchise. When songs are selected from these folders, the in-game introduction, gameplay interface, and results screens emulate that of the era selected. For newer players, this is a really cool opportunity to see how far the franchise has come in terms of design over the years as well, since many of the earlier versions of the game (aside from maybe DDR EXTREME) have become quite difficult to encounter in the wild. It's really exciting to see Konami do something like this for such a beloved franchise, especially when you consider the length that this game has inhabited arcades all over the world. After the more global availability of their e-Amusement service rolling out in the past few years (Many Dave & Busters and Round 1 locations in the US have it if you're looking to experience these features), it's also great to think about how many people will have the opportunity to participate in this celebration. This year is a huge year for their BEMANI franchise as a whole, and while they could have swept the whole thing under the rug it's really wonderful to see them embrace the fanbase in this way. The 20th anniversary for their pop'n music franchise is hot on the heels of DDR, so we'll definitely be keeping an eye out to see what they do with that too. In the meantime, you can find me in the arcade looking back on the close to 20 years of fun, friends, and opportunity this franchise has provided me.|Konami, DDR, DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION, anniversary, celebration

Not just in his home country of Korea, but also in Japan and North America, we've seen entire movements spawned of his works. One of the earlier pioneers of the Future Funk movement, Night Tempo has spent these last few months pushing himself in new directions, opting for original production over his previous sample-based musical stylings. Today we got another peek at just what Night Tempo has been up to, coming in hot with a remix of Vocaloid pioneer kz livetune's collaborative single with Yano Anna, "Darling Darling". Chances are if you've been vibing with the ever-evolving net music scene over these last couple of years, you've undeniably stumbled across Night Tempo's works at some point. He was the reviver of Mariya Takeuchi's now cult-classic "Plastic Love", bringing forward his own "100% pure remaster", and has been a continual driving force behind the sub-genre for some time. With his latest "Future Retro" flip of "Darling Darling", we see much of these same charms brought forward, offering the charm of Yano Anna's distinct vocals with a careful blend of both kz livetune and Night Tempo's own sound. This isn't the first time we've seen Yano Anna team up with Night Tempo, with the two frequently performing together and teasing various singles. This comes in at the same time that another forerunner in the scene, Moe Shop, has been working with the multi-talented vocalist, meaning we're sure to be seeing her name around quite a bit.

Just a few months ago we shared that PARK Harajuku was opening international shipping to a global audience for a limited-time test run, but as of today PARK made it publically known that this would become an ongoing part of their business -- just in time for the announcement of OMOCAT's collaboration with Miku Expo being in stock. ​ Announced today via PARK Harajuku's official Twitter account, the Tokyo-based cultural melting pot will begin selling the latest works from OMOCAT as made in collaboration with Miku Expo. Previously we've seen PARK Harajuku stock other pieces from OMOCAT's incredible catalog, making today's announcement little more than a necessity -- though that doesn't mean we can't be excited, especially given the licensing behind the properties being sold. Possibly one of the most exciting parts of today's announcements, however, was the detailing of a more permanent international shipping solution for PARK. There's nothing more frustrating than not actually being able to share the things I love with my friends, especially when something requires you to make the trip all the way to Japan. So the more stores out here open themselves to international audiences, the more excited I get, and PARK was basically the final frontier. There's absolutely a whole lot more going on at PARK Harajuku right now, and you're definitely not going to want to sleep on them leading into 2019.

14362|2018-09-24|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/judge-eyes-impressions-tgs-2018/| News | Games | [TGS 2018] Judge Eyes Gameplay Impressions | We made our way to Tokyo Game Show 2018 to try our hand at SEGA's upcoming action-adventure title Judge Eyes and all it had to offer. |It hasn't even been a full month since SEGA announced their upcoming Judge Eyes (Project Judge in the West) for PlayStation 4, yet already the Japanese gaming giant is going completely in on the marketing push. This means a lot of things, but most important for someone like me who absolutely can't wait to get their hands on the title, this meant that the game got some serious representation at SEGA's booth during Tokyo Game Show. Seizing this opportunity, I got some-twenty-minutes of gameplay time as protagonist Takayuki Yagami crawling through the streets of Kamurocho. With a scheduled release date of December 13, 2018, in Japan, and already three years worth of development put into Judge Eyes, it comes to little surprise that the demo made available at Tokyo Game Show felt extremely fleshed out. This comes to no surprise, of course, with visionary director Toshihiro Nagoshi handling the project alongside his Ryu ga Gotoku Studio staff, who you may know as the team responsible for the massively-popular Yakuza series. Though it didn't come as too much of a surprise, the Tokyo Game Show demo was the same made available on the PlayStation Store just a few weeks prior. This time, however, there were a couple of new additions including a VR playground and drone racing minigame that kept us pre-occupied for a little while. The real action came in with the story mode, kicking things right off with a trailing mission that took us through the back streets of Kamurocho and right into a number of goons who you'd throw down with. Gameplay was smooth, maybe even more so than that of the recently released Yakuza Kiwami 2, with sneaking around the streets feeling both fluid and responsive. You'll also see a return of that same great fight system utilized in the Yakuza series, with a few tweaks here and there to make sure it feels fresh. The characters who had been introduced were all enjoyable in their native language, and I'm sure the localization team will again work their magic to make sure they're as loveable in English too. If I had to share a complaint about the demo experience, however, the most glaring fault would be that I absolutely waited in line for over an hour to play a trailing mission. While I understand that this will likely be a large part of the game, I can't shake the feeling that they really could have left a more impactful impression on players who were warned they'd be unlikely to finish the demo due to its slow paced nature. At any rate, you'd be hard-pressed finding many actual faults with the demo, and I can't wait to see its story fully fleshed out when the title eventually releases in English next year. Currently slated to release December 13, 2018, in Japan, further details on the upcoming Judge Eyes can be found via the game's official website.|Judge Eyes, Project Judge, Sega, Tokyo Game Show, TGS, Tokyo Game Show 2018, TGS 2018
14361|2018-09-24|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/dq-builders-2-impressions-tgs-18/| News | Games | [TGS 2018] Dragon Quest Builders 2 Gameplay Impressions | We made our way to Tokyo Game Show 2018 to try our hand at Square Enix's upcoming arena fighter Dragon Quest Builders 2 and all it had to offer. |With Tokyo Game Show 2018 well underway, we spent most of our weekend making our way over to the unfortunately distant landmark location of Makuhari Messe to try our hand at a handful of games, one of which included Square Enix's upcoming title Dragon Quest Builders 2 on Nintendo Switch. There are few games on Nintendo Switch that I've spent more time enjoying than the original Dragon Quest Builders which released in English earlier this year. For hours on end, I'd find myself mindlessly building upon my town, adventuring and killing monsters, then finally completing the game's big ol' story. With Dragon Quest Builders 2, it seems like Square Enix intends to expand upon all of that and so much more, something I learned while playing the timed demo on Nintendo Switch in portable mode. Picking right up from the beginning of the game, we're introduced to a much more narrative driven tutorial than what was found in the original game. We see our protagonist locked upon a pirate ship, constantly teased under the threat of death, the young creator must appease his or her captors in a number of various mini-missions. Exploring the ship feels enjoyable, with the addition of first-person mode making for some genuinely entertaining moments. While the whole demo played in Japanese-language, the dialogue and interactions were all enjoyable and offered a unique charm that I can't wait to see translated. Unfortunately, with the game's time restrictions, I wasn't able to get much further than the initial tutorial zone; that being said, however, that in and of itself was enjoyable, regardless of already knowing the game's controls from the previous entry. I'm still tossing up as to whether or not I want to pick the title up on PlayStation 4 or Nintendo Switch, with the portability definitely being a relevant factor. Overall my experience with Dragon Quest Builders 2 was about everything I could have hoped for -- a fun, charming title that simply builds upon the already polished formula from the first game. Whether you're a fan of Dragon Quest as a franchise, or simply a fan of sandbox building games with a side of adventure, chances are you'll love Dragon Quest Builders 2. Set to release on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in Japan on December 20, 2018. There's currently no word as to whether or not it will be coming to the West, though we can only hope it will, especially given the recent Dragon Quest push internationally.

14358|2018-09-24|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/jump-force-impressions-tgs-18/| News | Games | [TGS 2018] Jump Force Gameplay Impressions | We made our way to Tokyo Game Show 2018 to try our hand at Bandai Namco's upcoming arena fighter Jump Forces and all it had to offer. |With Tokyo Game Show 2018 well underway, we spent most of our weekend making our way over to the unfortunately distant landmark location of Makuhari Messe to try our hand at a handful of games, one of which included Bandai Namco's upcoming Jump Force title on PlayStation 4. One of fifteen total playable titles from Bandai Namco at Tokyo Game Show, Jump Force was easily one of the most important for me to check. With all the hype surrounding the arena fighter, as well as its constantly expanding roster of fighters straight out of the pages of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine's biggest series', there was more than a few reasons for people to be excited. While the game's story mode wasn't available for play, I was given some hands-on time with the games versus mode. With a small-yet-stacked lineup of characters made available in the demo, of which I could play through two rounds, I was quick to choose my three-person team consisting of Goku, Naruto, and Gon against an enemy team of Frieza, Blackbeard, and Sasuke. I had chosen a rather oddball roster of fighters to pit against each other, but there was an odd beauty to that factor. I ended up singling out New York as the stage to fight on, which proved an excellent choice as the entire environment was gorgeous. One of my biggest skepticisms towards Jump Force before getting my hands on the game was its outlandishly polished visual style, but that took no time at all to be completely dismissed. While actually playing the game, you're thrust into a gorgeous and vibrant environment that looks absolutely incredible. Racing around the maps feels fluid, and there's nothing more satisfying than smashing someone through a cavalcade of buildings before landing that one last K.O. on your enemy. With that being said though, the game did have its fair share of plights; firstly, the game's fighting system feels entirely one-dimensional. The combo system requires no more than a simple two-button input, with some moves being as simple as spamming the same button over and over to achieve a high-level move. While this might be inviting to new players, it leaves little incentive for seasoned veterans of the fighting game genre to jump onboard -- arguably those who would have been the games core audience. For what its worth, however, Jump Force is honestly a pretty enjoyable game and also manages to leave a lasting visual impression -- but I can't say just how long that enjoyment will last. I'd definitely need some more hands-on time with the game to really judge how I truly feel about it. If you've got any investment in the playable characters, you'll probably have a lot of fun. But it's also hard to tell just how much the game will stand out without getting to play the story mode too. Set to release in February 2019, there's still a lot left to learn about Jump Force before it releases on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC early next year. Until then, however, further information on the title can be found via the game's official website.|Jump Forces, TGS, Tokyo Game Show, TGS 2018, Tokyo Game Show 2018, Bandai Namco
14360|2018-09-21|14:00||http://otaquest.com/hunter-hunter-god-like-return/| News | Manga | Hunter x Hunter Editor Teases ‘God-like Chapter’ for Series’ Return | While Hunter x Hunter series creator Yoshihiro Togashi may be nefarious for his hiatuses, it appears he's teasing something god-like for this comeback in particular. |Another year, another hiatus for Hunter x Hunter. At this point, there’s not much that creator Yoshihiro Togashi can do to alleviate the ennui of long-time fans who have been disappointed with the slow pacing and intermittent publishing schedule ever since the series moved onto it’s latest ‘Dark Continent’ arc all the way back in 2012. Or at least, that's how it seemed, with recent comments from the editor of the series would have us believe that things are really going to start heating up. Hunter x Hunter series editor Moji’s comments come from the NHK series 100 Cameras, which sees one hundred cameras placed in the Weekly Shonen Jump office to chart the activities of the editorial staff as they struggle with the various problems that come from the hectic environment of weekly publication. Moji was featured in a short scene from last Monday’s show, where the following exchange happened between him and a cameraman. Moji: “I’ve just gotten my hands on something seriously crazy.” Cameraman: “What? Moji: “A God-like chapter?” Cameraman: “...what god-like chapter?” Moji: “It’s been a long time since I received a manuscript that brought me to tears.” The manuscript that Moji clutches in the scene is of course none other than the latest chapter for Hunter x Hunter, which has come out of hiatus for the second time this year to resume in next week’s issue (September 24). It’s easy to get excited at comments such as these, especially since fans have been waiting so long for the newest arc of the series to pick up and show us it’s full potential, but it is important to take these comments with a fairly large pinch of salt. It’s in Moji’s best interests to get fans excited about the new chapter so that the magazine’s sales can be boosted, so it’s possible that he may be overexaggerating for publicity purposes. That being said, Hunter x Hunter is penned by the mad genius Yoshihiro Togashi, and he’s done some pretty crazy stuff in the past. But with the current arc still in the midst of heavy exposition in order to set up the new breed of Nen powers, the only shocking thing I can really think of is a major character death - and there’s certainly a fair few candidates. Obviously, Kurapika himself would be the most devastating death, but since he has effectively become the main character at this point, it’s unlikely that Togashi would shoot himself in the foot in such a way. If anyone’s going to die, then I’d argue it to be Leorio - he’s never served much of a purpose anyway and would be a good way to add some stakes to the current arc for Kurapika. Either way, we don’t have long to wait to see what the true nature of Moji’s comments was, with the latest chapter of the series releasing next Monday. I certainly can’t wait to get my hands on it.|Hunter x Hunter, Yoshihiro Togashi, Weekly Shonen Jump

So to prepare for the anime’s premiere next month, publisher Shogakukan will be releasing a new edition of the series, featuring never-seen-before material in an all-new format -- perfect for long-time fans and newcomers alike. Titled “Complete Edition,” this new reprint of Karakuri Circus will be A5 sized, making it slightly bigger than original takonbon releases but slightly smaller than the original magazine print. Still, the bigger size will let you appreciate Fujita’s excellent artwork all the better, and will come in handy when it comes to some of the Complete Edition extra features, which include never-seen-before production notes, illustrations, and character sheets, along with all of the original color pages from its initial run in Weekly Shonen Sunday. For longtime fans of the series, this is a fantastic opportunity to dive back into Fujita’s masterpiece in an all-new fashion, and for newcomers to the series, it’s a fantastic opportunity to read the manga before the anime begins airing. Even though the anime begins in merely a month from now, since two volumes will be released each month from now on, it’ll keep a good pace with the anime adaptation, and will perhaps tide over those viewers who’d prefer to wait for the Blu-rays to release. Furthermore, with VIZ recently announcing their English release of Naoki Urasawa’s similar cult hit 20th Century Boy’s Japanese hardcover, deluxe edition under the name The Perfect Edition, it definitely wouldn’t surprise me if another publisher follows suit by licensing this deluxe edition of Karakuri Circus, especially when considering the hype for the upcoming anime. Nevertheless, both volumes one and two of the Complete Edition are now available in Japanese stores. They are priced at 1400 yen each, and you can check them out via Shogakukan’s official website.|Karakuri Circus

Priced at 58,000¥, the newly designed and manufactured cabinets are made to provide as close to an authentic gameplay experience as possible to the original machines released back in the late 1970s. Arcade1Up announced their products for the US market earlier this year, featuring an array of influential and popular classic arcade titles to be released in an affordable and size-efficient manner for anyone who has dreamed of owning an arcade machine with their favorite game. What makes the Tokyo Game Show announcement so exciting (aside from the release in Japan) is that two new offerings, Space Invaders & Pac-Man, are being shown off on the show floor. These arcade replicas are actually a brilliant solution for the Japanese market as space is often very limited in the average building. These smaller form factor cabinets are perfect for any office or homeowner looking to add some fun to their surroundings. They even use the original artwork and design of the classic cabinets, making them an eye-catching decorative piece as well! The first 3 cabinets are going to be released in December of this year, with pre-orders for Japanese buyers currently available on Amazon. If you're in Japan and want more details on how to buy, check out the official Taito website for the product.

After his departure from Capcom last year many fans were wondering what was next for the man who helped define the rhythm game genre. The announcement that he was creating his own studio prompted a lot of speculation as to what direction he was moving in, and it seems that he's sticking with familiar territory. Being billed as a music game that's "not a music game", the concept actually seems pretty novel. A deep story is being woven in the title, with episodic content being released over the course of the title's first year of release. General gameplay hasn't been described in detail yet, but in game battles/action are going to incorporate a rhythm game element of some kind. The story of the game involves solving a series of mysteries that may save humanity from extinction. Depending on how players perform in the game, results will change globally in-game for all players as the story progresses. Maeda has long been concerned with accessibility for players worldwide and of all skill levels, and that seems to definitely still be the case. His initial announcement stresses that the focus on the game is fun, while still offering a challenge for skilled players. In addition, an audition event for illustrators and musicians is being planned, allowing for even more interaction with the game for all types of people. Longtime rhythm game fans will be pleased to see some familiar faces popping up in the title as well. Rhythm game veterans such as cranky, t+pazolite, REDALiCE, and newcomer KSUKE have been announced as participating with the title. The four of them appeared during a special announcement & talk event at Tokyo Game Show today to discuss the upcoming game. There's still a lot more information to come, and we're definitely going to be keeping an eye on this title. Maeda's last creation, the short-lived CROSSxBEATS, was a blast to play and featured an excellent array music. His determination to create the next evolution of music games is something that should excite fans of all kinds, and it'll be really interesting to see the development of this new project.

14338|2018-09-20|14:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/hiroshi-fujiwara-pokemon/| News | Games | Hiroshi Fujiwara & Pokemon Team Up For Thunderbolt Project | Hyper influential designer & tastemaker, Hiroshi Fujiwara, is teaming up with Pokémon for a striking new collaboration. |The Pokémon company has officially announced that they're partnering up with streetwear legend Hiroshi Fujiwara for a new line of boldly designed & striking products featuring some of their most iconic characters. Originally teased on Fujiwara's Instagram a few weeks ago, the collaboration is titled THUNDERBOLT PROJECT and is being promised as an ongoing series of different pieces to be released through 2019 "and beyond". At first glance, this might seem like an odd pairing; but given Pokemon's long history with outside designers that have a unique style, this seems like a no-brainer for a brand that is loved by so many people worldwide. There hasn't been much in the way of information about the project made available yet. We do know that the first item from the collection is slated to drop at the upcoming Hypefest event, taking place on October 6th & 7th in New York, at which Hiroshi Fujiwara is a member of the organizing committee. So far we've also caught a glimpse of a few minimal but amazing looking items from the collaboration including a black t-shirt with Pikachu's silhouette in white and a hoodie featuring a grey colored Mew on the back. Both items incorporate a thunderbolt shape that seems pulled directly from the logo of Fujiwara's Fragment Design label and are a stark contrast from the typically colorful designs seen in most Pokémon merchandise. special hoodie #thunderbolt_project #streetstyle #fashionsnap #ootd #fragmentdesign #fragment #hiroshifujiwara #藤原ヒロシ #pokemon #mew #ポケモン #ミュウ A post shared by THUNDERBOLT PROJECT (@tb_project) on Sep 16, 2018 at 6:27pm PDT While Fujiwara is no stranger to collaborations with pop culture icons (we covered his recent Bikkuriman collaboration a few months back), it's always exciting to see two behemoths in their respective industries team up like this. Both parties are known for pushing boundaries and have years of significant experience in trying new and exciting things, meaning that the possibilities here are endless. For me personally being a massive fan of the Pokémon franchise and an avid streetwear enthusiast, I'll definitely be copping as much of this collaboration as possible. You can find more information on the official THUNDERBOLT PROJECT Instagram account, and we'll be sure to report as more details become available!|hiroshi fujiwara, Pokemon, Pikachu, mew, Thunderbolt Project
14337|2018-09-20|12:00||http://otaquest.com/lupin-universal-studios-takeover/| News | Anime | Lupin the Third to Take Over Universal Studios Japan in 2019 | Lupin the Third is next in line to be featured in the ever-changing line-up of Japanese popular culture-themed attractions at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka. |With the likes of Detective Conan and Sailor Moon receiving themed attractions as part of Universal Studios Japan’s “Cool Japan” initiative, it will perhaps come as no surprise that Lupin the Third is next in line to be featured in the ever-changing line-up of Japanese popular culture-themed attractions. But with the franchise only recently emerging from a lengthy TV anime hiatus, it’s a sign that the series is back and better than ever. Lupin’s entrance into Cool Japan comes during the initiative’s fifth year, and there’s perhaps some poetry in the fact that the Lupin franchise celebrated it’s own fiftieth anniversary last year, with the original manga launching in 1967. Perhaps due to this seniority, then, Lupin will be kicking the almost equally legendary Neon Genesis Evangelion off the XR Ride attraction (which was previously occupied by Final Fantasy) to deliver it’s own VR attraction. While the details on this attraction are few, having rode the Final Fantasy VR ride earlier this year, I’m sure that the surprisingly effective combination of a VR headset and moving carriage will be entertaining, to say the least. Furthermore, there will be a new restaurant themed around the Lupin series, which will be both comedic and “hard-boiled” according to USJ’s official website - perhaps suggesting that the food served in the restaurant will be a little out of the ordinary, or perhaps that the diners will be treated to some kind of show during their meal, much like how the Detective Conan Mystery Restaurant had diners solving a mystery as they ate. Themed restaurants such as these are common at USJ, and it’s worth bearing in mind that it will most likely require reserving ahead of time, unlike the VR ride. Finally, the official website teases an “original story” that can only be experienced at the park, through the attractions, which is sure to excite any fans of the Lupin series. Detective Conan did something very similar this year as it had attendees solving mysteries alongside Conan and the gang through the various park attractions, so I wouldn’t be surprised if Lupin followed suit, perhaps letting us do some thievery with the gang, or perhaps putting us in the shoes of the hapless Inspector Zenigata as he attempts to bring the gang to justice. Either way, the attractions are expected to launch sometime in 2019, so we have a while to wait for more concrete information.

Easily one of the biggest properties globally in anime right now, it'll be exciting to see just how well My Hero Academia: Two Heroes performs in North America. Funimation describes the film below: The climactic finals are over, and U.A. is getting ready for the summer training camp. Deku and All Might receive an invitation from a certain person to go overseas to a giant artificial moving city called I-Island. This island, a kind of “science Hollywood” that gathers the knowledge of scientists from around the world, is holding an exhibition called I-Expo showcasing the results of Quirk and hero item research. In the midst of all this, Deku meets a Quirkless girl named Melissa and remembers his own Quirkless past. Out of the blue, the impregnable security system the island boasts is hacked by villains, and all the people on the island are taken as hostages! Now, a plan that could shake hero society has been put into motion! The man who holds the key to it all is the number one hero and Symbol of Peace, All Might.

The miniature take on the original PlayStation from almost 25-years-ago features that same iconic design that many grew up alongside, while also coming pre-loaded with a total of 20 classic titles. Set to release on December 3, the 25th anniversary of PlayStation, the mini-console has been announced at a price point of $99.99 USD. Right off the bat, Sony has announced that the PlayStation Classic will come pre-loaded with Final Fantasy VII, Jumping Flash, Ridge Racer Type 4, Tekken 3, and Wild Arms. While the remaining fifteen titles remain a mystery, we do already know that players won't be able to download additional titles post-release, a recurring trend within the mini-console scene. The console itself will be a total of 40% smaller than an actual PlayStation, meaning you shouldn't have any problems sitting up near any of your other devices. When it comes to the actual mini-console, it's your standard affair of I/O and all that flair; you'll be running the PlayStation Classic via HDMI and will be powering it from a micro USB cable. What's most interesting, however, is this throwback device will be bringing owners back to a time before PlayStation's even had joy-sticks. This will, of course, limit the titles that we'll actually be able to play on the device, meaning you probably shouldn't be looking forward to seeing Ape Escape in the list of full titles when they're finally announced. With just a few months until the December 3 release date, we're sure to see a number of different titles in the coming weeks. Until then, you can check out further information on the upcoming PlayStation Classic as well as where to pre-order it via its official website.|Playstation, PlayStation Classic, PlayStation Mini, sony

So when I was asked by the higher-ups last year to do a small piece up on the beverage, I really wasn't expecting much; it didn't take long before I learned the errors in my ways. You see, even up until recently I'd spoken legends of a Coca-Cola drink with a tinge of coffee flavor to friends, none of whom could actually picture what the drink would really taste like -- until today, that is. ITS BACK, THEY ACTUALLY BROUGHT COKE COFFEE BACK IM SO HAPPY pic.twitter.com/SKWTxtkcQ5 — lachlan johnston (@xrenazuka) September 18, 2018 Re-released nationwide in Japan on September 17, Coca-Cola Coffee is back with a new look and slightly larger can. For the most part, it's the same taste that I fell in love with originally, this time with the benefit of being able to get it at the convenience store as well -- previously the drink was only made available at Coca-Cola branded vending machines. Much to my disappointment, the drink is again being marketed as a limited-time offering, with Coca-Cola again being non-transparent as to when the drink will be off the shelves. Being sold in 250ml size cans, the drink comes in at only 50kcal per can, and a total of 12g carbohydrates. They'll cost you about 130 yen, where I've managed to find them at Family Mart, I can't vouch as to what other convenience stores they'll be sold at. Here's hoping the drink will have a bit of a long life cycle this time because I don't want to be waiting another year to dig into this.

That was until, seemingly out of nowhere, the storefront announced a sudden temporary closure just a few short months ago. Since then, the status of the store was largely unknown, with little details shared outside of the store's inner-circles. This changed earlier today however when a new photo was uploaded to METEOR's SNS accounts announcing the opening of their new Nishi-Ogikubo store.

It's one of few locations in the Tokyo area that actually stocks goods from fashion brands such as Chloma and Balmung, while also offering various independent zines and niche accessories. While the trip to Nishi-Ogikubo might not be as convenient as the Nakano spot, it's definitely worth the trip and I can't wait to get out there myself.

With the official cover art for the game, we see a gorgeous return to Kingdom Hearts' roots, not shying away from that distinct artistic charm that made the games so gorgeous to look at in the first place.

It's not just that we're looking at revisiting what was honestly one of the greatest puzzle experiences of its time, but also it really does look like ATLUS has put in their all for this one. Featured throughout the latest trailer was a slew of gorgeously animated moments, as well as a whole bunch of new information including the much-requested addition of online multiplayer. Opening to a series of in-person interviews on the streets of Harajuku, the interviewer opens with "What do you think about soul mates?" and ”What would you do if you met your soul mate?" to a scattered audience. It's a mixed palette of responses, most of which can be summed up to "Sounds like something out of an anime" to "I'd marry them on the spot". Following this, however, we're thrown right into the action with an overly-dramatic opening scene the screams Catherine. First and foremost, possibly one of the most important pieces of information learned today is that the new girl, Rin, is now being referred to as Qatherine. Yes, you read that correctly, they're going with a Q. Following that is the aforementioned addition of online multiplayer, a long-requested feature since the game originally released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011. On top of all this, ATLUS has also announced that players will have up to 10 different voices for Catherine to choose from, most of which will be released via DLC after the game releases. If all this wasn't enough, ATLUS additionally detailed that they'll be releasing DLC to allow players to enjoy various modes within the game as Persona 5 protagonist Joker. During the times in which you're playing the game as Joker, you'll be joined by a number of other Phantom Thieves of Heart members. Set to release exclusively on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on February 14, 2019, the upcoming Catherine: Full Body has me climbing for even more information. Until then, however, you can check out further details about the game on its slightly NSFW official website.|Catherine: Full Body, Catherine, Catherine Full Body, Atlus, Persona 5

They've been pushing out some of the cleanest anime-inspired pieces in some time, with a distinct focus on bringing the treasures of their childhoods to the forefront of street culture. With an already expansive catalog of incredible collaborations, NA has begun their mission of spreading these anime masterpieces worldwide with a quintessential stop in at Milan, Italy for their first European pop-up store. Running from September 15 until September 30th, the currently ongoing pop-up store is taking place at the TENOHA MILANO building in the global capital of fashion and design Milan, Italy. It's an obvious pick for the first stop in a Europe Tour, and definitely, quite a prestigious one to boot. Operating from 11:00 until 19:00 daily, those who make their way to the pop-up are also going to be receiving a limited-edition lookbook and sticker while stocks last. Most recently we provided coverage of NA's all-new MF GHOST collaborative drop, where the team worked together with legendary Initial D series creator Shuichi Shigeno to bring his latest series off its manga pages and into our closets. We've been vibing pretty heavy with everything else that's dropped too, from Ghost in the Shell to FLCL and everything in-between. Originally started by streetwear and video enthusiasts Ryunosuke Shimura, Sosuke Minamiura, and Shintaro Hirashima, the trio began constructing ideas for NA following their disappointment in the lack of official clean anime-inspired clothing available. “NA is meant to be not only a brand, but also a reference point for all the people who are passionate about the titles we treat. Wearing the logos related to the stories which shaped our generation makes any of us an ambassador of that specific title, and it does it in a cool, fashionable, and contemporary way.” Those interested in checking out even more details on the pop-up shop should head over to NA's official website.|NA, NA Is the name, NA Clothing, streetwear, Ultraseven, Ghost in the Shell

While details were relatively light during the reveal, with not even a release timeframe shared, we do currently know that the project is being fronted by Bibury Animation Studio, with Tensho (Grisia, Kin-iro Mosaic, Rewrite) directing the project. Handling series composition will be Jin Haganeya who previously worked on Demonbane and Kamen Rider Gaim. For the most part, it's an interesting roster of talent being brought together for this anime; Bibury Animation Studio themselves being only a year old. Following on from that, you'd be hard-pressed finding too much "real" story within Azur Lane's mobile game, leaving a whole lot of responsibility on the anime's creative team to make this work. In the past, we saw rival series Kantai Collection receive an anime adaption to very mixed reviews. Having previously enjoyed Kantai Collection quite a bit before jumping ship to Azur Lane, here's hoping that they manage to put some sort of substance to the series. Additionally announced during the first-anniversary celebration was an all-new 3D Azur Lane RPG title for PlayStation 4 which is set to release sometime in the future. While Azur Lane only recently released in North America, the game has seen a massive and continuous growth in Japan over this past year. It'll be interesting to see how much pulling power the series will continue to have in the future, though it definitely appears that they're making all the right moves early.

14316|2018-09-14|15:00||http://otaquest.com/sekiro-tgs-trailer/| News | Games | Giant Foes and the Supernatural Previewed in Tokyo Game Show ‘Sekiro’ Trailer | Take down gigantic foes and supernatural entities in the upcoming Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice title as previewed in its latest Tokyo Game Show trailer. |Tokyo Game Show is always a great time for fans of Japanese games, and its already shaking up to be yet another excellent year; a wide spectrum of publishers coming to the event with an entire catalog of great titles. With that being said, no title has me more excited than FromSoftware’s upcoming shinobi action adventure game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which received a new trailer during the conference that only has me more eager to get my hands on it. Considering the creative stagnation from the developers towards the end of the Dark Souls series, many fans were hoping that this new title would allow the team more freedom to develop new ideas. And while previous trailers have served to emphasize how different the game is from the studio’s past work, this trailer sees some familiar tropes working their way into the upcoming title. I'm talking, of course, about the giant bosses that are prominently featured in the second half of the trailer. It’s reassuring to see that bosses will be back, especially since FromSoftware has always had a knack for crafting challenging yet memorable encounters. Some of the bosses glimpsed are a foe that fights while balancing on a suspended wire, a mammoth foe with lots of arms, and an absolutely huge monkey that comes hurtling at the protagonist at the end of the trailer with devastating effect. Fans have already noted the environmental storytelling present on the monkey’s body, as it bears a massive scar around its mouth, as well as a sword lodged in its throat and some kind of fungal infection emerging from the sword wound - suggesting that this monkey has a lot of history that we will hopefully be able to uncover. Another boss glimpsed in the trailer was what looks to be a tall humanoid wielding a polearm which they use to already devastating effect before splitting into three - forcing the player to fight three bosses simultaneously. This reminds me a lot of the Pontiff Sulyvahn boss from Dark Souls 3, who also splits into multiple versions of himself, and is particularly interesting because it confirms that Sekiro will feature some more supernatural elements alongside it’s more grounded presentation. To be honest, I never bought for one minute that FromSoftware was making a simple shinobi game, and just like how Bloodborne turned out to be about much more than hunting, these supernatural elements suggest that Sekiro may be more than meets the eye. Furthermore, we get to hear quite a lot of lines from what fans are assuming to be the protagonist, Sekiro which also is further reinforced through the editing of the trailer. Not only does he have an awesome voice, but if you listen closely, his voice sounds very familiar. Who will be playing the role of Sekiro has yet to be confirmed, but many are speculating based on the voice in the trailer that it is Hiroaki Iwanagi - none other than the voice actor for Guts in the more recent adaptations of Berserk. This would definitely make sense for the studio, as director Hidetaka Miyazaki has always been influenced by the Kentaro Miura’s dark fantasy series. So if it does indeed turn out to be Iwanagi, then that surely is a dream come true for the developers. All in all, things are shaping up nicely for Sekiro as FromSoftware both break free from their recent development history, while sticking to what they’re good at. The game will launch in merely 9 months and is already available for preorder. I can’t wait to get my hands on it.|Sekiro, From Software, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice

Currently set to release at some point in 2019, the upcoming turn-based RPG title was revealed during the September Nintendo Direct that took place today. Though not much was revealed about the title, we did get to see a small segment of actual gameplay footage, showcasing the game's unique visual style. Set in a simple yet peaceful town, your story kicks off when monsters begin invading and upsetting the "lasting peace" that the area has known for some time. This isn't an ordinary RPG, however, with the teaser footage announcing that the whole game will actually take place within the confines of the starting town, a mechanic that could prove interesting if executed correctly. The game's battle sequences will utilize the familiar turn-based system, where players will have the ability to call on surrounding villagers to aid you in your fight. While GAME FREAK may be best known for their work on the Pokémon franchise, this definitely isn't their first time fraying away from pocket-sized monsters. Most recently we saw the release of TEMBO THE BADASS ELEPHANT for basically everything but Nintendo consoles, on top of a slew of previous releases from the Japanese developer.

With a consistent track record of incredible releases, their latest "TAO" and its accompanying music video are by no means an exception. Originally shared via Apple Music, iTunes, and Spotify, the latest single from the group wasted no time in producing an extremely on-brand music video; not that this comes as much of a surprise, especially with how consistent director Kento Yamada's works remain. Characterized by their washed out color palettes and never-still camera techniques, yahyel's music videos have proven themselves time and time again. With "TAO", yahyel tells a coherent story from start to finish, with the music video's final minute especially standing out to me, with incredible sweeping shots of the band jamming to their fullest. Released earlier this week on all major platforms, it'll be exciting to see where the rest of 2018 takes yahyel and their signature stylings. Available for streaming now, further information on yahyel's latest release, as well as upcoming live shows can be found via the band's official website.|Yahyel, tao, yahyel tao, beat records

Although little information was actually revealed about the title, Compile Heart did share a promotional movie for the upcoming game on their official YouTube channel, which can be seen below: While I usually wouldn't touch a mobile RPG with a ten-foot pole, it's no secret amongst my peers that Azur Lane is a total guilty pleasure of mine. Stemming from my long-lived love for the Kantai Collection franchise, it was a natural progression that felt almost too smooth in this ever-evolving landscape. As such, however, I can't help but be painfully excited about the prospect of a 3D variant of the mobile application, especially with how much I enjoyed the Kantai Collection Arcade title, which featured similar premises. There's currently no announced release date for the upcoming PlayStation 4 RPG title, nor is there word of an English-language release. Given the recent success of the English-language smartphone release, I wouldn't be too surprised if an announcement was made in the future.

This is, of course, the first release from Charisma.com to not feature DJ Gonchi, with MC Itsuka handling the project as a solo artist as of right now. While it's definitely a different sound from previous releases, I'm all for what MC Itsuka is laying down here. Let's take a look at the latest track below: Announced alongside the drop of the music video was a November 9 live event at Shibuya WWW, hinting at a solid return to activity from Charisma.com. What this means for MC Itsuka's future as Charisma.com remains to be seen, but it's definitely exciting that such a prominent name is returning to form, even if it's in a slightly altered way.

It was released during what is often referred to as the "Golden Age of Arcade Games", a time when the industry was ripe with innovation and fresh ideas that spawned a whole generation of loyal players. Capturing that innovation and pairing it with the bleeding-edge of now, Directive Games took to the stage during this week's Apple Keynote event to showcase their upcoming Galaga AR. Taking to the stage at Apple's all-new Steve Jobs Theater, Directive Games co-founder and CEO Atli Mar demonstrated the upcoming augmented reality take on the classic Galaga title with two additional staff members. Banding together, the three-person team attempted to take down waves of bugs overlayed on top of their surrounding environments. Though no official footage has been uploaded online as of right now, the footage shown during the Keynote stream was honestly quite impressive and seems like a good way to mindlessly kill some time. It'll be some time before we actually see this title hit the iOS platform, however, with the game currently slated for a 2019 release.

So amazing, in fact, that you could argue it worthy of its own standalone package; something that's now coming to fruition at the upcoming Pop Team Epic Fes event at Makuhari Messe on September 15 until September 16. Set to release in Blu-ray format at AC-bu's own booth during the event, fans will be able to get their hands on 22 previously released shorts, and an additional 2 Blu-ray exclusive shorts. アニメ「ポプテピピック」の箸休めコーナー「ボブネミミッミ」だけを集めた映像作品集が、9/15.16幕張メッセイベントホールで開催される「ポプテピピピックフェス」で先行販売決定！【全22話+新作描き下ろし2話+高速紙芝居ヘルシェイク矢野収録】オリジナルステッカー付き pic.twitter.com/6uItGqnnQd — AC部【公式】 (@ACbu_official) 10 September 2018 With a total runtime of 19 minutes and a cost of 2,000 yen, however, it remains to be seen as to just how essential this purchase will really be. Fans of AC-bu's antics won't have too many quarrels I'm sure, with the knowledge that the accompanying pair of stickers would likely cost more than a quarter of the price if they were made available in retail. To each their own though -- this certainly isn't the most outlandish price either, especially given that it's not clear as to how many Blu-ray disks will actually be made available.

Developer Dharker Studios shared online earlier this week that their upcoming Negligee: Love Stories title, which had spent an extended period of time in limbo while Valve refined their terms would release on the Steam platform on September 14 completely unaltered from its original adult form. While previous releases on the Steam platform allowed for a censored version of the visual novel to be installed, while later prompting the user to download a patch to re-add censored objects, the upcoming release of ​Negligee: Love Stories will be the first time a visual novel could be downloaded with adult content completely uncensored. The announcement was made via the official Steam page for the game, with Dharker Studio's comments available below: I am happy to say that Steam have now released new content filters including the Mature Adult game filter, and confirmed to us that happily the game can be re-reviewed with this content in mind. As such tomorrow we will be re-submitting the game for review in its fully uncensored format. I have also set a new release date for the 14th September 2018. Giving enough time to not only re-review the game and prepare everything but also potentially refine the game further and add in some more art and images before we release the game on steam fully uncensored as it was originally designed. Update: The game has completed the review process and will be released on schedule this Friday, 100% uncensored. While it might be the first of its kind to release on Steam, there's no doubt in our mind that Negligee: Love Stories is only the start of what's bound to be a massively expansive push onto the platform. Stemming from such an already developed genre of games, we can't help but wonder just where Valve will eventually draw the line -- though only time can tell. Until then, you can check out Negligee: Love Stories on Steam right now, here.|Negligee: Love Stories, Negiligee, Steam Uncensored, Visual Novel

Set to release exclusively on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, the upcoming Catherine: Full Body throws a wrench into the life of protagonist Vincent with the introduction of a third Catherine. While the game has been announced for Western release, we're still not quite sure exactly when that will be -- though I'd hope the push-back in release date domestically wouldn't affect the international release too much, if at all. It wasn't all bad news during the announcement, however, with Atlus additionally revealing to Weekly Famitsu that they will be hosting a livestream on September 15 at 19:00 JST to premiere an all-new trailer for the game. On top of that, the game will also be made fully playable at Tokyo Game Show when it kicks off from September 20. While much of Catherine: Full Body remains shrouded in mystery, the game is described by Atlus below: Is it a nightmare or a dream come true? A new test of Vincent Brooks' morality is about to take the stage in Catherine: Full Body! This new twist on the original Catherine, a mature romantic action-adventure puzzle game from the makers of the Persona series, will include a new love interest, "Rin," with distinct storyline elements for the character, and additional puzzle content. Vincent's love life has never been so complicated and dramatic!

Only amplifying this hype was the recent reveal of a third key visual for the series, as well as a gorgeous looking new PV that comes in hot at just over a minute. Uploaded to Tsuburaya Production's official YouTube channel earlier this week, the latest PV can be streamed below: Originally revealed at Anime Expo 2017, the new-age animated take on mid-90s tokusatsu Gridman the Hyper Agent (adopted as Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad in the West) was one of three projects announced by Studio TRIGGER at the time. Just a year later, we'd see Studio TRIGGER once more return to Anime Expo, this time bringing with them the first episode of SSSS.GRIDMAN. Joining the reveal of the all-new visual and PV, we also got our first glimpse at the series' premise, as seen below: You're not alone. On any day, anywhere. Yuta Hibiki, a first-year high school student living in Tsutsujidai, one day wakes up to find he has lost his memories. It's at this time that he meets the "Hyper Agent Gridman" on his old computer. Gridman informs Yuta that he has a mission he must fulfill, leaving Yuta to set out on a journey to find the meaning to those words and his memory loss. Yuta's friends — Sho Utsumi, Rikka Takarada, and Akane Shinjo — would always help him and spend their days with him. But, their tranquil days are suddenly and easily crushed with the appearance of kaiju.​ Set to premiere in Japan on October 6, we can't wait to see what Studio TRIGGER manages to do with SSSS.GRIDMAN. Until then, however, you'll want to be sure to check out even more information on the upcoming series via SSSS.GRIDMAN's official website.

That's why when series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi came on stage yesterday during Sony's pre-Tokyo Game Show presentation, I immediately put down what I was doing. What he announced on that stage certainly wasn't what I was expecting, but I couldn't possibly be more stoked -- offering us our first glimpse into the world of JUDGE EYES (currently titled Project JUDGE in the West), the latest video game series from the team. Set to release in Japan, China, and Korea on December 13, 2018, easily the most exciting part of the announcement was how quick SEGA of America were to announce that the game will be releasing in the West in 2019. Joining the announcement today was the launch of a playable demo, which is currently available on the Japanese PlayStation Store as of today. It's unconfirmed if/when the demo will be releasing in the West, but one would hope that shouldn't take too long. Following the story of Takayuki Yagami, a lawyer with a personal agenda following the loss of a friend, JUDGE EYES is seeming like it'll hit all the right spots with an incredible new story that's been over three years in development. Toshihiro Nagoshi shared that this is a project he's been wanting to make for a very long time and that it'll be something "completely different" from anything done by the Ryu ga Gotoku Team before, despite the familiar locale of Kamurocho. Apparently, I'm not the only one who is feeling the excitement either, with the story trailer for JUDGE EYES currently sitting atop the trending charts on YouTube in Japan immediately after upload. Whether its the incredible accompanying music from Japanese rock outfit ALEXANDROS, or the high-paced appeal of the gameplay, it'd appear that JUDGE EYES really has struck a chord with everyone. It'll be exciting to see just how the game pans out, and I can't wait to get my hands on it when it finally releases in 2019.

Featuring a mix of both 2D animation and real-life visuals from the band, the release comes fresh off the heels of a widely successful North American tour alongside Toonami's release of both FLCL Alternative and FLCL Progressive. With next year set to celebrate the 30th anniversary of 'the pillows', it should come as no surprise that the group already maintains a well-developed signature sound and style. It's because of this that "Ningen Domo" sounds much like a, well, 'the pillows' song -- though that's definitely not an issue. With their recent work on both new installments of FLCL, there's perhaps no better time for new and returning listeners to get into 'the pillows', making "REBROADCAST" such an important release for them.

This isn't something that is too out of place in the current musical landscape with global sensations like Bruno Mars and Daft Punk reaching back in time for inspiration to some of their biggest hits in recent memory. The reason for this to be on anyone's radar is the instant success the video saw on YouTube immediately after release. While the collaborating acts both have long-storied careers, the response to this video has been overwhelmingly positive and garnered a lot of attention from netizens in Japan. The track itself is a funky ride with a message of pure positivity. The lyrics have a theme of enjoying yourself and not sweating the little things. The chorus's assertion that "Everything is no calorie" with lyrics that advise you to go to the gym and work it off later are a metaphor for that message. Using food as a theme throughout the song is something everyone can relate to and allows for some pretty solid wordplay throughout (as the duo of Sandwichman is most known for). Even the title is a portmanteau of Umai (Delicious) and Marvelous, something that might be lost on listeners who aren't native Japanese speakers. The video itself plays up on the funky sound of the song with visuals that seem clearly influenced by the video for Earth Wind & Fire's "Let's Groove", and an overall pastiche that mimics the video quality of the time. The familiar look might even stand out to fans of recent hit anime, Pop Team Epic, as the show parodied the same overall aesthetic for their "Let's Pop Together" segment in the first season. A coincidence I'm sure, as Monkey Majik hasn't exactly shied away from parodying or mimicking the look of the past for their videos. The video for their 2016 single "Delicious" was a blatant parody of the now infamous "1988 Crystal Light National Aerobics Championships" opening video. With "Umarvelous" racking up 750,000 views over the past week, it's great as a fan of Monkey Majik to see success 16 years into their career. I'm really excited to see what they do next, as a band who has shown plenty of variety with their tracks over the years and participated in a number of amazing collaborations (including "Picture Perfect" with m-flo in 2007) the sky is the limit!|Monkey Majik, Sandwich Man, new single, Comedy, Music, funky, Japanese, umarvelous
14265|2018-09-06|15:00||http://otaquest.com/how-lain-predicted-the-future/| News | Anime | How ‘Serial Experiments Lain’ Predicted the Future | This year celebrated the 20th anniversary of Serial Experiments Lain offering a chilling reminder as to just how prophetic the series remains to this day. |Can you believe that Serial Experiments Lain was released 20 years ago? I certainly find it hard to believe. It’s been a constant in the anime community for as long as I can remember, and it’s constantly ranked among the best shows of the medium. It’s aesthetic has also held up well, thanks to a unique art direction. But more so than all of that, it’s hard to believe because the series has continued to be powerfully prophetic ever since it’s release - in fact only gaining in power the more time passes. In this aspect alone, it’s utterly unique. Producer Yasuyuki Ueda was the mastermind behind the project, and he took great risks in hiring character designer Yoshitoshi ABe straight out of college as well as writer Chiaki Konaka, at the time still a greenhorn with several gigs writing for Ultraman. Director Ryutaro Nakamura was less of a risk since he’d worked with him before, but moving forward into production there were a lot of unknown quantities that could have led to a horrible failure. Surprisingly then, the initial broadcast of the series on Japanese TV proved incredibly popular, and although this success may have overshadowed the release of a PlayStation game a little later, it was nevertheless quickly picked up by Western distributors for a release merely one year later - a rare occurrence at the time. Ueda himself was excited to see the series make it’s way Westwards, as he thought that Japanese audiences and Western audiences would have very different interpretations and therefore inspire further debate concerning the series. However, it turned out that both audiences had largely the same interpretations of the key themes and messages. A large part of this was due to the homogenous technological environments shared at the time. These days Japan and the West differ in their use of technology, with many Japanese citizens solely using their mobile phone while laptop and computer use remains widespread in the West. But at the time, mobile phones were in their infancy and the situation with computers in both Japan and the US was largely the same - a new phenomenon that only a small handful knew how to operate and build. The result of this was an internet in 1998 that was the great unknown. Much of the general public didn’t have much experience with it, and those who did were free to do whatever they wanted, provided that the technology enabled them to do so. This sees its reflection in the series as the Wired is presented as a portal to another world, where one is free to do whatever you want but is full of malicious, unknown agents. Concepts of science fiction being influenced by social conditions aren’t exactly new, and in fact, fiction often represents the conditions at the time in some way or another, but science fiction is unique in that the fictional technology presented in it us gives us a clear taste of that. Take the king of cyberpunk, Blade Runner, and you’ll see the blocky analog machines of 1982 reflected in the designs of Deckard’s car and his apartment. Go back merely five years to Steven Spielberg’s masterpiece Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and the design of the alien mothership which houses a metropolis of skyscrapers mirrors a time in which the metropole was seen as the pinnacle of engineering and technology. Lain’s initial representation of the Wired is a far cry from our own connection to the internet today. Far from being unknown, use of the internet has become a known and essential part of existence. Even if you don’t use the internet in a personal capacity, you’d be hard pressed to find a job nowadays that doesn’t involve the use of a computer, if only to check some emails. In this sense, the mystery behind the internet has been stripped away, only aided by the fact that our own scope of usage has receded greatly - we no longer search for new websites and blogs beyond our own sphere of interests, but stick closely to ones that we already know that collate what would usually be on its own web space in 1998, such as Twitter and Facebook. As a result, even though the series is still intensely relevant, there are some aspects of it that aren’t quite as pertinent as they were in 1998 - particularly when it comes to the destruction of the ego. Throughout the series, Lain struggles with a multiple personality disorder that seems to come with her increasing engagement with the Wired (although it depends how you interpret it) which begs the question of how the virtual self can undermine the ‘real’ self. It’s a question that seems rather antiquated when considering that anonymity and therefore the possibility of creating a new self is limited on the modern internet, as even if you don’t share personal information online, giant corporations know exactly who you are through data collection and tracking. But Lain’s genius and incredible foresight come from how it actually challenges the notion of wonder that many attached to the 1998 internet. Minami Eiri, the false god of the Wired, represents the notion that the internet is an ‘upper layer’ of reality, allowing us to transcend it and evolve artificially through technology. This notion is thoroughly refuted by the series as Lain represents the struggle to realize the limits of the internet, and the realization that it can only ever be a separate sphere to our existence, and not one that somehow transcends reality and becomes it’s own. This reflects how the internet would evolve, up until the present day. As knowledge of the internet and of technology increases, the possibility of freedom becomes limited as it becomes a ‘known’ property. Far from being an escape for many people, the internet has merely become a tool to aid in our everyday life, becoming another ‘sphere’ of our existence meant to reinforce reality, not transcend it. In this sense, Lain was decades ahead of its time. It tackled the popular notion of the internet at the time, refuted it and correctly predicted what our existence would be like today, in 2018. It also warned us of the dangers of trying to exist solely in the internet, an issue becoming more and more pressing as social isolation becomes more and more of a problem, with its harrowing ending where Lain is trapped in the Wired with only an imagined father figure as company. Such incredible foresight could have only come from the team that Ueda gambled so much by putting together. Chiaki Konaka’s writing was dense yet intriguing, earning the show a cult-following and securing for himself a reputation for dark, surrealist works. Yoshitoshi ABe’s character designs were nothing short of iconic and made the show stand out and flourish on a technical level. And the efforts of director Ryutaro and producer Ueda cannot be understated either - they steered the ship and allowed the show to become the masterpiece it is revered as today. But will Lain continue to be as prophetic by the time it’s 30th, or 50th anniversary rolls around? Will it be a relic of the past, just like so many other science fiction works? I wouldn’t know. Technology always has a habit of developing in ways we never expect, and even if the internet can’t offer us the potential of another plane of existence, then perhaps something else will. But to those of us who consumed the show at a time when it was intensely relevant, it will surely continue to resonate. Such is the power of a masterpiece.|Serial Experiments Lain, Lain

The latest trailer can be seen below: Set to be directed by Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt episode director Shunichi Yoshizawa, and featuring scriptwriting from Harutoshi Fukui, Mobile Suit Gundam NT pulls together a cast of franchise veterans to help build the next generation of Gundam storytelling. The upcoming film's premise can be read below: U.C. 0097, one year after the opening of "Laplace's Box." Despite the revelation of the Universal Century Charter that acknowledges the existence and rights of Newtypes, the framework of the world has not been greatly altered. The conflict later dubbed the "Laplace Incident" is thought to have ended with the downfall of the Neo Zeon remnants known as the Sleeves. In its final battle, two full psycho-frame mobile suits displayed power beyond human understanding. The white unicorn and the black lion were sealed away to remove this danger from people's consciousness, and they should now be completely forgotten. However, the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 03, which disappeared two years earlier, is now about to show itself in the Earth Sphere once more. A golden phoenix... named Phenex.

From the hyper-stylistic animation techniques all the way to the design choices of both clothing and vehicles, I can't even begin to imagine the inspiration board for the crybaby project. Of course, I wasn't the only one paying attention to such details, with Japanese car manufacturer Mitsuoka Motors earlier today announcing a limited-edition Devilman crybaby variant of their legendary Orochi supercar in which Ryo Asuka's primary car directly drew inspiration from. While it may not be the exact colors of Ryo Asuka's variant of the car, the Devilman-inspired spin adds a menacing look that wouldn't be shy of commanding the streets. This beast certainly isn't a toy, with the limited-run car expected to sell for 19,680,000 yen (roughly $177,000 USD) during its initial release. Pre-orders are set to open from September 8, with the car expected to be delivered at some point during December 2018. While the release of the Devilman crybaby variant of the Orochi is a collaboration with the 2018 anime adaptation, it also positions itself perfectly alongside the 50th anniversary of both Go Nagai and Mitsuoka Motors respectively. This isn't the first time that Mitsuoka Motors has offered an anime-related collaboration variant for their signature Orochi, with 2014 seeing the world graced with an equally limited Evangelion Edition variant of the supercar. While the car's color scheme might be just a little too flashy for my own taste, I'm pretty in love with the actual silhouette of the Orochi.

Such was the case with recent revelations that the Justice Party, a South Korean political party formed in 2012, had traced an educational commercial directed, edited, and storyboarded by Makoto Shinkai himself for their own political advertisement. Originally screened alongside the theatrical release of "your name." in Japan, Makoto Shinkai's "Cross Road" anime short was originally created for Japanese cram school Z Kai in 2014. Through the comparison video above, it becomes quite clear that there's some level of uncredited content stealing being committed by South Korea's Justice Party; a fact which would later be confirmed in a public statement. During the statement, it's revealed that the individual who helmed the advertisement project was a massive Makoto Shinkai fan and that he traced the creator's work to meet tight deadlines. That's not all, however, with the Justice Party fully apologizing for not only tracing Shinkai's work but also stealing his compositions for their own campaign. It's disappointing, to say the least, that in this day and age, individuals still believe that they can get away with blatantly copying the work of another creative. There's taking inspiration from those you love, and then there's taking the entirety of someone else's hard work; don't be like that.

Originally released in Japan during March 2000, this weeks news comes 18 years after Japan first started getting their hands on the console, and 12 years after the release of the PlayStation 3. Announced via the PlayStation Japan Blog earlier this week, the company asked owners of the PlayStation 2 console to fill out a number of online forms by the end of last month, before submitting them if they want to have their console repaired one last time. That being said, consoles that don't make it over to the Iwate-based service center before the deadline of September 7 won't be accepted for repair, giving you roughly one last day to same-day that console. With over 155 million units sold worldwide, the PlayStation 2 felt like a staple of just about every household during the early 2000s. With an incredible library of games from across the globe, the console flourished and would go on to define an entire generation of games. Building on from that, during the time of the PlayStation 2's release, the console doubled as one of the cheapest DVD players on the market, broadening the customer base beyond just those looking to play games. Even if the PlayStation 2 is officially reaching the end of its life, the console's legacy isn't something that can ever just be discontinued. Here's to you, PlayStation 2.

14244|2018-09-04|16:00||http://otaquest.com/yugioh-digitization/| News | Anime , Games | ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!’ Trading Card Game Makes Bold Step Towards Digitization | Yu-Gi-Oh!'s long-running card game series took another leap towards total digitization recently, perhaps meaning that dreams of Battle City are a lot closer than previously thought. |The trading card game Yu-Gi-Oh! has been going strong for over 20 years now, with its original manga beginning serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump in 1996. But while the card game core of the series hasn’t and probably never will change, Konami are moving towards securing a new future for the series with the help of the latest technology. The news came when developers from Konami attended a computer entertainment conference on August 23 to discuss their successes in developing a new computer recognition program designed to, well, recognize Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards. The system can already recognize and differentiate between around 9000 cards with a 100% accuracy rate, but such a success was the result of a considerable amount of trial and error. Since putting QR codes or other traditional image recognition tools on all existing Yu-Gi-Oh! cards was impossible, the developers had to figure out a way for the system to recognize cards as they were. Just getting the computer to scan the card didn’t work very well, since a computer can’t compete with the numerous ways through which a human can remember a card by sight, which utilizes multiple senses. Yet, rendering semi-transparent composite images of each card and entering these images into the computer’s database worked surprisingly well as it brings out each card’s unique features more easily for the computer to interpret, leading to the developers’ current successful system. What Konami intend to do with this technology is still unknown, but we can make an educated guess. With the rise in popularity of digital trading card games, including Yu-Gi-Oh!’s own Duel Links, digitizing the current card library for use in the digital realm through a computer could be what the series needs to bridge the gap between digital card collectors and physical card collectors. By getting a computer to recognize physical cards played and transferring this to the virtual realm, players with both digital and physical libraries could technically face off for the first time in history. That being said, there are many problems with that. Not only would this have a massive effect on the physical card market, forcing them down in value, it would also drive up the value of digital cards to be closer to their physical counterparts since there would be no conceivable difference between the two. Furthermore, Yu-Gi-Oh!’s current digital flagship Duel Links features a very different, much less complex rule system than the physical trading card game, so there would be a large difference between the two players in terms of skill and game knowledge. Therefore, it’s more likely that Konami will be using this technology to better detect counterfeit cards, which have always been a thorn in the side of the trading card game. The technology could also be used to provide a framework for more AR games in the future - Konami has already been experimenting with AR in conjunction with the trading card game, as seen at this year’s World Championship: While the above battle is clearly heavily scripted and more for spectacle than anything else, combining the image recognition technology with a robust AR application to render the monsters of each card in real life, just like in the animated series, sounds like something straight out of many of our childhood dreams. In this sense, I think Konami are really onto something here, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing how this technology pays off in the future. Thanks to Harry and Alicia for the news tip.

The new title is going by Hunter x Hunter: Greed Adventure, and scheduled for release later this year. The game will follow Gon, Killua and other familiar characters from the series in a brand new story that takes place after the Greed Island arc, where our protagonists are thrown into a mysterious new Nen game titled “Greed Island 2.” Check out the trailer below: Almost everyone from the series is here, from the entire Phantom Troupe, to even the head butler of the Zoldyck family, Gotoh. One character you won’t recognize, however, is who steps out of the Shiso Tree, the starting point of Greed Island. While we may not know who the character is at the moment, there is a strong possibility are they are either the key behind the mystery of Greed Island 2, or simply just the player’s avatar. The story of Greed Adventure will take place after the original Greed Island arc, and will allow players to relive moments from the original arc as well as explore an entirely new story around the emergence of “Greed Island 2.” It features characters from later arcs, such as Pariston, so it’s probably not going to be super strict on the timeline, mind. However, considering that all other Hunter x Hunter stories not penned by Togashi (eg. Phantom Rouge and The Last Mission) are nothing short of awful, not many fans are holding out for anything amazing from the original story. With that being said, as long as the gameplay is engaging, the new game may be on to a winner. Everyone who has watched the series wants to act out the awesome abilities of the many characters, and taking Greed Island specifically as inspiration fits very well since it is actually a video game. The official website for the game launched recently, and while only the announcement trailer is featured on there at the moment, more news will no doubt continue to filter through. Any fans of the series eager to learn more should keep a close eye on it, with access available here.|Hunter x Hunter, hxh, Weekly Shonen Jump, Hunter x Hunter: Greed Adventure, Greed Adventure

From the incredible theme song as performed by Hikaru Utada, all the way to the gorgeous animation style from Studio Colorido, Penguin Highway seemingly presents itself as a complete audio-visual package that I'm sure international fans of the anime medium will truly be able to sink their teeth into. While it's currently unknown as to when ELEVEN ARTS will begin the theatrical release of Penguin Highway during the winter, we can rest assured knowing that fans in the United States will be able to enjoy the film as soon as early 2019. During the time of writing ELEVEN ARTS' homepage has not been updated to reflect the announcement, though further details will be located via their official website.|Penguin Highway, Hiroyasu Ishida, Eleven Arts, Crunchyroll Expo

Much to the surprise of nobody, people still aren't happy about the extremely unfortunate mistreatment of original series director Tatsuki which saw him removed from the project following the conclusion of the first season by KADOKAWA. Before anything else, let's take a look at the preview video below: During the time of writing this piece, the video which was uploaded on September 2 currently sits at roughly 3,800 likes and over 29,000 dislikes with a little more than half a million views. That's no small difference, with it being abundantly clear that fans of the series are extremely upset about the whole ordeal. Japanese fans were quick to take to the comment section of the upload to share their thoughts -- "Even from such a short clip, you can already tell this isn't going to be right". -- while international fans also shared their disdain for what the series had become. Though little information actually surfaced surrounding the anime's second season, it'll be interesting to see just how far KADOKAWA is able to take the series' second season. Even at its core, Kemono Friends was never about being an incredible show, it was simply about bringing together a community of friends who could enjoy a show simply because it was fun. So without these friends to support the second season, it's honestly quite hard to predict how it will all turn out.

The latest Virtual YouTuber to follow this trend is Kaguya Luna, one of the biggest talents up there with Kizuna Ai, with her debut VR Live at ZEPP LIVE, as well as the release of her debut digital single "Beyond the Moon" which is available everywhere but YouTube now (hah). Taking a look at the digital single, "Beyond the Moon", it's basically everything you'd expect from a Kaguya Luna song -- it's a total drunken mess layered over the top of an incredible instrumental backing. But don't be confused by that, the song is actually quite a slapper, though I don't think you can just show it to someone totally unfamiliar with Kaguya Luna and expect them to enjoy it. Composed by PABLO a.k.a. WTF!?, Kaguya Luna's debut single is a hot mess in the best possible way. The single can be streamed below: Though the single stands on its own for fans of Kaguya Luna, the real magic came in during the KAGUYA LUNA LIVE @ ZEPP VR event that took place on August 31, 2018. Though I couldn't join in on the fun due to lack of access to a VR headset, the whole event looked absolutely insane from after-footage and photography. There's no doubt in my mind that the whole event would have been something to witness, and I can't wait to see how future events are expanded upon, especially with the booming nature of the Virtual YouTuber business.

Building on as an alternative to the ending presented in Dragon Quest II on the NES, the game looks to vastly improve upon the basis presented by the original Dragon Quest Builders title from 2016. Surprisingly one of my favorite games on the Nintendo Switch, the original Dragon Quest Builders held its own within the sandbox genre by offering an interesting story and plenty of adventure. Once more featuring iconic character designs by Akira Toriyama, the latest entry into the Builders series offers new features such as co-op and multiplayer support, as well as a handful of additional features and fixes to make the game even more interesting than ever before. I'm legitimately excited for the release of Dragon Quest Builders 2, and it's definitely a game I'll be picking up early within its release.

Now with over 44 years of experience under the perpetual anthropomorphic third-grader's belt, Hello Kitty is finally ready to take on her next big challenge -- becoming her very own Virtual YouTuber. It's an interesting proposition really; an already established icon riding one of the biggest trends in Japan right now, all while targetting a totally new demographic of viewers. It's genius. With that being said, just what can Hello Kitty offer the world that YouTube doesn't already have available? Fortunately, there are a few things being done right by the channel so far, which can offer a little promise for what could be a legitimately entertaining channel -- if you fall into the target demographic. Firstly, Hello Kitty takes queues from some of the most globally enjoyed channels, offering subtitles in numerous languages. Right now that includes English and Japanese, but if all goes well I wouldn't be surprised to see that expanded upon. Secondly, it's already been announced that the channel will likely be joined by other Sanrio characters, with Gudetama and Kirimi-chan particularly mentioned, though I definitely hope we can see that expanded upon. Unfortunately, it's uncertain just what direction content will head on the channel; where other Virtual YouTubers can utilize video formats such as Let's Plays, I can't imagine Hello Kitty will be playing PUBG or Fortnite any time soon. Ultimately the concept of Hello Kitty joining the Virtual YouTuber circuit is as goofy as it sounds, but I'm sure that it'll strike the right chords within a certain market. It's uncertain what schedule Sanrio will be uploading videos to the Hello Kitty channel, but it'll be worth keeping an eye on to see just how it develops. |HELLO KITTY, Sanrio, Hello Kitty YouTube, Virtual YouTuber

These last few years have seen Nintendo attempt to make quite a few attempts to break into the mobile gaming market, with titles such as Super Mario Run, Fire Emblem Heroes, and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp immediately springing to mind, but few of those look as interesting as "Dragalia Lost" does, especially if the recently released footage is to go by. Set in the fictional kingdom of Alberia, Dragalia Lost follows the story of the seventh heir to the Alberian Royal Family, known only as the Dragonblood Prince, who commands the bloodline ability to shapeshift. When his kingdom comes under threat, the prince must begin his journey to create a pact with the legendary dragon Midgardsormr in order to borrow its form and immense strength. During this adventure, your character will make a number of friends, as well as a fair share of rivals who you'll be encountering as the game progresses. The game appears to be one of Nintendo's most interactive mobile titles yet, offering numerous playstyles that aim to include campaign co-operative play, online multiplayer raids, and an immersive single-player story. Utilizing a free-to-start model, the game allows players to drop their real currency on in-game items and cosmetics, something I'm sure we're all too familiar with already. Scheduled to release on iOS and Android on September 27, there's just a little less than a month standing between us and Nintendo's first original mobile title. Pre-registration is currently available via the game's official website, with some in-game incentives being included for those who sign up.

14211|2018-08-30|13:00||http://otaquest.com/monogatari-pupuku-impressions/| News | Games | [Impressions] Remembering ‘Monogatari’ Through ‘Pukupuku’ | While Monogatari has long celebrated a rich and diverse fanbase across the globe, it comes as quite a shock that the franchise never made a real burst into the mobile market. |When it comes to recent trends, I’m honestly surprised there hasn’t been a full-fledged Monogatari mobile game already. I mean, it already has tons of excellent original music that could be used for a rhythm game, and it has enough fights in it to do some kind of turn-based, Fate/Grand Order-esque mobile RPG, but here we are, almost 10 years after the initial airing of Bakemonogatari, and we finally have one. What we got may not have been exactly what any of us expected, but maybe that's okay. If I'm totally real with myself, I’m honestly thankful that it’s not a rhythm game or a mobile RPG. We’ve got far too many of them - and I play far too many of them - so when I discovered the latest application was going to be a puzzle game, it was refreshing news, to say the least. As the name suggests, Monogatari Pukupuku (sometimes referred to as Monogatari Puc Puc) is a collaboration between Nisio Isin’s original creation and the long-running match-three puzzle game, which is quite a break from the mold in terms of the current mobile game landscape. But we are talking about a Monogatari game, after all - it never plays by the rules. Bringing in the already refined gameplay of Pukupuku was perhaps a genius move by the developers, as it provides the game with an already solid foundation upon which they can add some Monogatari flair. In Pukupuku, you attempt to match the same types of ‘pukus’ to clear the board, earn a higher score, ramp up your combo and activate the abilities of your chosen deck of cards, which all have different activation conditions and different abilities once they’re activated. Pukupuku has already collaborated with every brand under the sun, from Yo-kai Watch to Disney (yes, just in general), and that just proves how reliably entertaining the gameplay can be. It’s incredibly addictive as you search for the most insane combos possible and chain your deck’s abilities together to clear the entire playing field at once, but it’s also incredibly accessible, owing to a core gameplay loop that almost anyone can get after a couple of rounds. But that’s not to say that the gameplay is easy - rather, after a few levels in Monogatari Pukupuku, I found myself enthralled by clearing the special challenges attached to each level, such as getting a high score or activating abilities of your deck multiple times; after clearing which you can get special ‘ema’ card featuring iconic moments from the series. In this sense, for someone who just wants to clear the stages the gameplay is satisfying enough, but it’s for a completionist that the game becomes truly rewarding. Beyond Pukupuku itself, however, the game offers a cathartic experience for Monogatari fans, especially those who have been around for a while. The structure of the game is that of series of stages linked together by iconic moments in the series that you can play through, unlocking dialogue, art and movies as you go. This makes it feel like a trip down memory lane as you relive some of your favorite moments in a different form. That being said, it’s certainly not something someone new to the series could get behind, since the presentation of its story is wholly inferior to that of the light novels or anime, but for a longtime fan of the series it’s perfect - and I felt myself smiling at all the same jokes and conversations, all over again. With that being said, perhaps this is the perfect time to remember Monogatari. This year we’re going to see the final mainline installment in the Monogatari series get animated with Zokuowarimonogatari, headed up once more by the genius that is Akiyuki Shinbou, which will effectively spell the end of what has been a decade of Monogatari in anime - and what a decade it’s been. We’ve laughed, we’ve cried, we’ve fallen in love with Araragi and his strange, dysfunctional harem. Perhaps it time we celebrate that. Monogatari Pukupuku is available for download now for iOS and Android devices.|Monogatari, Bakemonogatari, Monogatari Puc Puc, Monogatari Pukupuku

14204|2018-08-29|16:00||http://otaquest.com/lupin-the-third-evolution/| News | Anime , Manga | Analyzing the Evolution of 'Lupin the Third' | In a world of reboots and reimaginings, Lupin the Third feels like a breath of fresh air. It’s been on Japanese screens for nearly 50 years, and throughout that time it’s pretty much stayed the same. |In a world of reboots and reimaginings, Lupin the Third feels like a breath of fresh air. It’s a series that has been on Japanese screens for nearly 50 years, and throughout that time, it’s pretty much stayed most the same - always giving us the capers of the grandson of a master thief with the same cast of wacky characters, whether it be in 1971 or 2018. But underneath the surface, Lupin the Third has shifted. It’s not entirely obvious at first sight since the characters and the basis of the series have stayed the same, but the mechanics allowing such a series to function have moved considerably with the times. The evolution of the Lupin series shows how to keep a property relevant, but not by betraying the original - a lesson that rings true today more than ever. Let's take a look at the character of Goemon Ishikawa the Third. Both the 2015 and 2018 series have dedicated episodes to exploring Goemon’s character, allowing his hilarious man-out-of-time character to shine. Furthermore, he’s even had an entire movie featuring him with 2017’s The Blood Spray of Goemon Ishikawa - letting us see some badass samurai action that has, for some reason, fallen out of vogue with the current anime landscape. All of this has led to him becoming a firm fan favorite, which all seems very strange when considering his origins in the first series all the way back in 1971. Far from being a key member of the cast, he wasn’t even present in the series until episode five, where he was originally introduced as an antagonist. Even after his introduction, his inclusion into the main cast wasn’t felt until Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata took over production during the second cour, and even in the subsequent Lupin the Third: Part II he hardly ever played a major role in the events of the story. Goemon’s inclusion into the main cast and exploration as a character through increased focus over time is but one example of how the mechanics of the main cast have changed. And while Jigen has mostly stayed the same cool, gruff sharpshooter, Lupin himself has seen major character shifts over time - changing his jacket along with his temperament. In the original series, Lupin was much more of a comical character, often driven into thieving because of his hubris (women) and often failing because of this. Less important was showing his prowess as a master thief than it was to entertain the viewers with his failings, which fit in with the altogether more cartoonish tone of the early series. Though with that being said, his characterization in recent years could not be further from that. Although he does get into comical escapades and acts the fool at times, he’s all together become a much more suave, noble James Bond-esque character. He’s even genuinely charmed characters such as Ami, which would have never happened back in his inception. But by far the biggest change for Lupin himself has to be the relationship with his longtime love interest, Fujiko Mine. The classic series saw Lupin jumping cartoonishly out of his clothes to be in with any chance of getting down with the Fujiko (which was almost always returned with a swift denial on the femme fatale’s part), and this obsession with Fujiko was almost always the reason why Lupin’s plans went awry. You’ll see none of this in recent series, with the most recent Lupin the Third: Part V even showing that Lupin and Fujiko have grown apart, with Lupin shying away from the mere mention of her name. Lupin is definitely still motivated by sex, but this is no longer a character flaw - instead rendering him into more of a James Bond-esque womanizer. This transformation has also meant that the cartoonish style of the older series has disappeared, giving way to a more realistic presentation, complete with international conspiracies and coup d’états. That being said, the question still remains - why has Lupin changed? If the series has always been successful since it’s inception all those years ago, then what was the point in changing these character dynamics? Part of the answer comes from Mari Okada and Sayo Yamamoto’s revival piece The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. While I said that the Lupin series has been around continuously for 50 years, it is true that Lupin as a TV series only came back into vogue following Okada and Yamamoto’s 2012 series - previously the franchise had propagated itself on movies and TV specials, following the failure of Lupin the Third: Part III which suffered from poor production and creative exhaustion. In this sense, it should come as no surprise that the revival being successful would set a precedent for future Lupin series from a business perspective, but beyond that, Fujiko Mine had an important artistic impact. Crucially, it showed that the character of Fujiko could be sexy and flirtatious without being posed as powerless and uninteresting - that a woman’s sexuality could be empowering, and not just an object to be consumed by her male peer's gaze. This idea allowed Fujiko to be a much more well-rounded than she was in the past, and subsequent series have readily taken this idea on board. Fujiko and Lupin have hardly had any sexual contact in the post-Okada years, and she’s even been pushed to the background in terms of Lupin’s love interest with the introduction of Rebecca in Lupin the Third: Part IV and later Ami in Lupin the Third: Part V, once more allowing her to be a much more well-rounded character than in the past. The impact of Okada and Yamamoto’s series stemmed from their own experiences as women working in the anime industry, but on a larger scale, tapped into the popular consciousness at the time. With a changing climate that aims to allow for the same economic power to be distributed between both women and men, in a country like Japan that was previously so driven by gender norms and roles, it simply doesn't fit the times for Fujiko to act the way she did in 1971. We’ve rightfully realized that women have more worth on screen than simple objects and that chauvinism isn’t something to be celebrated. But all of this wouldn’t have happened if the staff behind the recent Lupin series were not aware of the series’ past, or simply didn’t care about the series’ future. Mari Okada and Sayo Yamamoto are but a small sample of the talented creatives that TMS Entertainment have sought to bring aboard Lupin projects in recent years. Without these individuals, however, Lupin’s return may have been tasteless and outdated - there are plenty of properties that return as such. The result of all this is a Lupin the Third in 2018 that still gives us the same experience as creator Monkey Punch intended, but not in the same way. The laughs come from character interactions and not slapstick, Fujiko is empowered and not objectified, and yet it’s still as good as it used to be. Just because the mechanics of the series need to be changed doesn’t mean that the series needs to do as well, because Lupin has still got much more to offer.

Not only was the series based in Akihabara, but many of its iconic locations actually exist in the real world - such as the Radio Building, UDX, and even the Future Gadget Lab, where Okabe and friends unwittingly invent the world’s first time machine. Another fictional place from the series that actually ‘exists’ in the real world is the shrine where Urushibara Luka lives and works. While Luka’s Yonagibayashi Shrine is named differently from Akiba Shrine, it draws direct inspiration from it for the design of the temple building that appears in the series, while its grounds draw inspiration from another shrine in Akihabara. Nevertheless, it’s been a popular spot among Steins;Gate pilgrims for years and this year the shrine will be embracing its status among fans and holding a special celebration for Luka’s birthday, as well as it’s own 130th birthday. As part of the celebrations beginning August 30, fans of the series will be given a rare opportunity to go inside the shrine itself (which is usually closed), and a free Luka badge will be given to anyone who hangs an ema (a type of commemorative Shinto wood block) to celebrate the shrine’s 130th birthday. Furthermore, the seichijunrei app ‘Maidai Meguri’ will be running a special event where you can use AR to pose with Luka for a picture, or perhaps take a tasteful snap of him at work. Free tea will also be on offer, which never hurts. For those of you who haven’t visited the shrine just yet and are a fan of Steins;Gate, then this might just be the perfect chance to go ahead and do so. It’s just a short walk up from Akihabara Station itself, which will also allow you to scope out some of the other numerous Steins;Gate pilgrimage locations on the way. You can find the location of the shrine below: |Steins;Gate, Steins Gate, Akihabara, Luka

That success isn't limited to international releases either, with both the Famicom Mini and Super Famicom Mini in Japan being an extremely hot commodity up until recently when the stock began to stabilize; leading into Nintendo announcing their new double pack for both Classic consoles in one package. Set to release exclusively in Japan on September 15, the double pack will contain both the Famicom and Super Famicom mini consoles, as well as a single USB AC Adapter at a price point of 15,077 yen. Originally kicked off with the release of the Famicom Mini in 2016, a modern miniature take on the classic home console, it would only be a year later that we saw the release of the Super Famicom Mini in 2017.

For nine years now, MOGRA has existed as the melting pot between numerous aspects of underground club music culture, offering a unique anime-slanted spin that isn't shy of commanding a loyal following from across the globe. Watch MOGRA 9th ANNIVERSARY DAY3 from MOGRA on www.twitch.tv Anyone who knows MOGRA should be aware that the clubs identity can largely be split up into a few unique subgroups -- anisong, club music, and everything sprinkled in-between. It's these subgroups that MOGRA has built a long-spanning identity out of, and each part was celebrated in full throughout the three-day event. During the third day which was, unfortunately, the only day I could make it out for, we saw the party kick into overdrive with performances from a number of legends such as kz livetune, DJ WILDPARTY, and Pa's Lam System. The party didn't stop there though, with every single act bringing their own unique flair to the celebrations. This year marked my third year in attendance at the MOGRA anniversary event, and it was possibly one of the most exciting years to date. It's exciting to see that this far into the clubs lifestyle, MOGRA owner D-YAMA continues to innovate and excite with incredible events and playful collaborations. From their latest work with American hentai publisher FAKKU on their ever-popular skateboard decks to the club's ongoing partnership with Twitch.tv, it's exciting to see just what they're capable of pulling off. I think I speak for all of the OTAQUEST staff when I say this, but I wish MOGRA another ten years of success, and I can't wait to see what the team does next. I'm beyond looking forward to the 10th-anniversary party, and I can't wait to celebrate another 10 years after that with MOGRA too. Here's to you, MOGRA.|mogra, Akihabara, Dear Stage

We can form connections over oceans, share information without borders, and even create whole new identities for ourselves - the latter of which is something most emblemized by the recent Virtual YouTuber trend, which still marches forward with full force in Japan. The power of the internet even allows fictional characters to become real moving entities, and although we’ve seen the likes of Super Sonico make their debuts as Virtual YouTubers, we’ve yet to see someone as iconic as Mr. Heart be immortalized as a Virtual YouTuber - that is, until now. As part of the 35th anniversary celebrations of the legendary shonen series Fist of the North Star, the iconic Mr. Heart - who screamed “Hidebu!!!” as he exploded - will be making his debut as a Virtual YouTuber; a move that brings an iconic character of popular internet culture to the already lively Virtual YouTuber circuit. While one might expect that the role of Mr. Heart would already be chosen ahead of the announcement, the voice of the character is actually open to the public. Applications are being held from now until September 17 through an online form, where I'm sure that after vetting the entrants' applications, those selected will be tasked with actually showing off their motion capture ability. No previous experience is required, just that applicant can ‘capture’ the iconic voice and motions of Mr. Heart. While these conditions may seem tough considering how iconic the character’s voice and manner is in his original incarnation in the Fist of the North Star TV anime, with how popular the character is in Japanese popular culture, I’m sure there’s more than a few people who’ll be able to pull off a convincing enough performance. If all goes well, then expect to see Mr. Heart joining the internet as a Virtual YouTuber come November.|Fist of the North Star, Mr. Heart, Hokuto no Ken, Virtual YouTuber
14194|2018-08-28|16:00||http://otaquest.com/we-never-learn-anime-announced/| News | Anime , Manga | Weekly Shonen Jump’s ‘We Never Learn’ to Receive TV Anime | Taishi Tsutsui's ongoing 'We Never Learn' manga series is receiving an anime adaptation as announced by publisher Weekly Shonen Jump. |While it’s only been in serialization for little less than a year, Taishi Tsutsui’s slice of life romantic-comedy series We Never Learn is getting an anime adaptation headed by director Yoshiaki Iwasaki (Hayate the Combat Butler, Love Hina) at newly established studios Arvo Animation and Studio Silver. Joining the announcement, an all-new promotional website for the series opened this Monday, revealing it’s first key visual: The announcement followed many leaks and much snooping by fans, who uncovered the site boku-ben.com and Twitter account @bokuben_anime weeks before the official announcement, so while the announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, it is most certainly a welcome one. Tsutsui’s series has built up a solid following for itself in the short year since it’s serialization began in Weekly Shonen Jump, owing to its solid art direction, likable characters, and being able to fill the huge, Nisekoi-shaped hole in the heart of the magazine since the series’ conclusion in 2016. The series has also been selling quite well, which probably has something to do with why an anime is being produced this early on into the series’ run. That being said, I am looking forward to seeing how this adaptation works out. Comedies, in general, tend to work better in motion, and I’m sure that the already large fanbase for the series will also enjoy seeing their favorite characters in motion. VIZ Media is currently translating the series as part of their English-language Shonen Jump, following the story of high schooler Nariyuki Yuiga as he attempts to tutor two girl geniuses in order to achieve his dream of an all expenses paid university scholarship. You can read the first three chapters for free on VIZ Media's official website.

Simply listening to the song was one thing, acting as a sure-fire way to get the adrenaline flowing as you bounce around as fast as your body would let you, but seeing all seven of the group members perform live to the tune is a whole other beast. That's where their latest music video comes in, stemming straight from their most recent live performance. While Dempagumi.inc is certainly beginning to age, celebrating their tenth anniversary this year, that doesn't mean they're showing any signs of slowing down at all. Their high-energy stage presence is nothing more than a testimony to just how long we'll be celebrating the year of Dempagumi, something I'm completely okay with.

Building on from the foundation laid down by the previously-release Yakuza Kiwami, we see the intertwined stories of both Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima play out in a gorgeous display, bringing forward the full power of the PlayStation 4 over its original PlayStation 2 release in 2006. Having sat in my pre-orders for the longest time, the actual writing of this piece brings some real pain as I desperately wait to get home and really sink into the game's story. For those who didn't get a chance to check it out previously, SEGA released a demo of the game a few months back, offering a preview of the game's second chapter, as well as its gorgeous visual and technical improvements over the previously released remake Yakuza Kiwami. Available exclusively on PlayStation 4 as of right now, I'd urge just about everyone to give the series a shot, with the recently announced inclusion of Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami in the PlayStation 4 "PlayStation Hits" library serving as a great place to start.

Exciting news today as developers Lizardcube and Guard Crush Games announced their continuation of the iconic, genre-defining Streets of Rage series in the first new installment in the series since 1994. Aptly titled Streets of Rage 4, the game will continue the story of series protagonists Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding and build on the classic gameplay of the original with the introduction of new mechanics and stages. It will also feature hand-drawn animations, which you can see some of in the reveal trailer below: The project is in good hands as both studios are incredibly suited for the job, with Paris-based developers Lizardcube already making a name for themselves in remaking and updating classic games for the 21st century with 2017’s Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap, and with Montréal-based developers Guard Crush specialising in the beat ‘em up genre with their ongoing series Streets of Fury. Publishing the game is Dotemu, whose mission is to ‘give every gamer access to yesteryear’s classic video games on today's platforms.’ Dotemu’s mission is certainly something I can get behind, especially when it comes to Streets of Rage. There aren’t many games nowadays that can capture the visceral feeling of a good beat ‘em up, and this announcement has made me crave the synth-soaked and testosterone-driven destruction that only Streets of Rage can offer. The Streets of Rage series was originally published and developed by SEGA during the 1990s, where it saw three releases and many ports. What’s more is that many consider Streets of Rage 2 to be one of the greatest games of all time, so for the series to be continuing is a big deal. From here I can only hope that the new developers can do the series justice and give us all what we want -- another chance to smack hordes of bad guys halfway to next Tuesday.

14184|2018-08-27|15:00||http://otaquest.com/seikiro-fromsoftware-impressions/| News | Games | ‘Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice’ Looks to Break Away From FromSoftware's Traditions | Following Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice's appearance at Gamescom 2018, fans couldn't be more stunned by the award-winning title. |From a consumers point of view, the annual Gamescom event always comes around as a moment of bliss. Not only does it offer a slice of the gaming conference fun to Europe for once, but it also stands heads and shoulders above the likes of E3 because of the focus it places on the games themselves instead of the equally-critical marketing aspect. Perhaps most important to myself, however, this year offered a special opportunity for fans of FromSoftware, creators of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, with a demo build of their upcoming game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice available for attendees to play. Although many were excited about the game, no one expected how excellent the demo would truly be until they got their hands on it - something that would lead to the title receiving the prize for "Best Action Game of the Show". The reveal trailer during the Microsoft Conference at this year’s E3 already showcased the spectacle of grappling, but how the studio has implemented the grappling hook into gameplay is revolutionary. FromSoftware has never really changed the core gameplay of their games since the cult-hit Demon’s Souls, and although Bloodborne upped the speed, Sekiro is the first game from the studio in a long time that feels fresh and original. Now, instead of being stuck on the ground engaging enemies, you can choose to engage them from above, in mid-air, or even not at all by sneaking across the rooftops. The grappling hook also plays a key part in combat as well, as you can use it to grapple onto enemies to break the flow of action by jumping atop their heads. Embedded into our protagonist’s prosthetic hand, the hero has a lot more tricks up his sleeve than that though, with a shuriken, flame cannon as well as a hand axe function all on display. All of these abilities can be switched on the fly during combat, feeding into intensely fast and furious engagements that echo that of Bloodborne, but in a more much fluid and dynamic manner because of the need to chip away at an enemy’s stamina, and not at an arbitrary health bar. Combat in this game is yet another breath of fresh air as compared to other titles, as the game’s stealth system is much more robust than previously expected. Like any other action-stealth game, you can crouch walk to approach silently, hide in tall grass, and even hug walls. Seeing such a system in a FromSoftware game is surprising at first, but despite their lack of experience with such a system, it seemingly works perfectly. As a result, players can switch up what they choose to do in-game and not just continue on an incessant string of combat engagements - a mechanic that keeps gameplay fresh and interesting. With all that being said, however, many issues surrounding the game still need to be addressed. Chiefly of which is the issue of replayability - FromSoftware has previously announced that there will be no PvP or leveling up in the game, an announcement of which has drawn mixed reactions from fans. After all, all three Dark Souls games were kept alive well after launch by an active PvP community as well as the possibility for multiple different styles of playthrough, so the studio’s decision in this case only seems to hurt the game’s chances post-launch. All that aside, its hard not to be impressed by the current state of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. It’s fast, it’s stealthy, it’s vertical - but most of all, it’s different. FromSoftware have finally been liberated from their Dark Souls series, and now they are free to pursue new creative ideas. The result of which is what professional lore scholar and all around community legend VaatiVidya refers to as “the most polished demo build I’ve ever played from FROM.” And we’ve still got seven months to go.|Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Sekiro, FromSoftware, Fromsoft

In certain cases, whole towns have even mobilized to better facilitate this phenomenon, with a prominent example for this occurrence being the model for Studio Ghibli’s legendary Whisper of the Heart, an animated feature-film based in Seiseki-Sakuragaoka, Tokyo. With that being said, it should go without saying that the immense popularity of the Fate/stay night franchise means that there a fair few people who want to visit the real-life locations of Fuyuki City. Most of the places in the series have been found to be based on real-life locations in Kobe, West Japan, but one mystery always remained - what was the design of the Japanese-style Emiya Mansion based on? Certain aspects of the mansion had been throughout various parts of Kobe, but up until recently, the mansion largely remained shrouded in mystery. That was until pilgrimage blogger Okayoriidete received a comment on their blog pointing them towards a teahouse in Chiba - and what they found there was a treasure that has waited 14 years to be uncovered. というわけでなんとですね、本当に素晴らしい方からのコメントのおかげで、衛宮邸の聖地が発見された模様です。 pic.twitter.com/fCN3qbtY5u — アングラー (@okayoriidete) 23 August 2018 As you can see from the picture, the teahouse looks almost exactly like the Emiya Mansion that appears in the original 2004 visual novel. It’s always crazy when you go somewhere like this and get an intense feeling of déjà-vu, so I can’t even begin to imagine what kind of feeling this must conjure up inside any Fate/stay night fan. Not only is this a great discovery for Fate fans and anime pilgrims alike, but the teahouse’s location in Chiba is incredibly convenient. After all, it’s just a train ride away from Tokyo, and Chiba itself is home to many otaku-focused events in it’s Makuhari Messe Hall, such as Wonder Festival and Tokyo Game Show, so stopping by the Emiya mansion after a tough otaku outing for a cup of tea may become a firm ritual - just like making your way over to the Gundam in Odaiba is a firm tradition after a long day at Comiket. If you’re thinking of taking the pilgrimage yourself, then check out details of the teahouse here. Thanks to Ben for the news tip. |Fate/Stay Night, Emiya Mansion, Anime Pilgrimage

You see, over here in Japan, there's another Conan that dominates the scene; the legendary titular anime/manga icon Detective Conan, otherwise known as the protagonist of the Case Closed series in the West. During the three-minute segment, Conan O'Brien points fingers at the character for not only "stealing" his name, but also his identity as a whole: After breaking down just how Detective Conan has been stealing his likeness for over 24 years, Conan O'Brien goes ahead and does some mental maths in front of the camera before deducing that the total cost in damages equates to several trillion yen. That's a lot of yen, roughly equating to anywhere in the billion-dollar ballpark, but Detective Conan is no small deal, I guess. The whole segment is good for a bit of a laugh, and it's cool to see a series like Detective Conan get a bit of airtime on such a major show in America. Those interested in checking out even more about Detective Conan, Crunchyroll is streaming the whole series on their official website.|Conan O'Brien, Detective Conan, Conan

14150|2018-08-21|13:00||http://otaquest.com/fukushima-gaina-rebrand/| News | Anime | Fukushima GAINAX Finds New Life as ‘GAINA’ | GAINAX Fukushima is moving on from their previous relationship with GAINAX by cutting the x out of their life and re-branding as "GAINA". |It goes without saying that most of you will probably already know the story of Studio GAINAX. Formed by a group of college friends, the studio burst onto the scene with a series of explosive OVAs that defined a generation and emblemized the otaku subculture in the 1980s. Just years on, it’s legendary cast of alumni would go to define their own generations with such seminal works as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. To help spread their expertise and creative spirit, GAINAX set up many different studios around Japan, but this endeavour never truly took off due to the studio’s hemorrhaging of staff in the mid-2000s - which led to GAINAX and it’s Fukushima branch separating capital ties and becoming separate entities in 2015, while still maintaining the same name. Even separated, however, Fukushima GAINAX could never find their footing in the industry beyond a handful of projects. Far from being an offshoot of a legend, the studio remained in relative obscurity - until now, as their acquisition by the Takeshita Group was formally announced and their name changed, dropping the X to operate henceforth as ‘GAINA.’ The Kinoshita Group is a large conglomerate with many fingers in many pies, with their real estate businesses the most developed of all of their holdings. GAINA joins their entertainment division and is by far the most well-known holding in the category. Being acquired by such a group might seem like the end of the former Fukushima GAINAX’s freedom at first, but in actual fact, it’s unlikely that Kinoshita will have much control over the studio. In these types of large conglomerates, the individual holdings are usually pretty free to do what they want, provided that they turn a profit for the company as a whole. Joining such a conglomerate also means the studio will have more resources on hand, with money coming in from the top in an attempt to revitalize its work. We’ve already seen the effects of that with the studio recently moving offices from Fukushima to West Tokyo, locating it in what has become a heartland for anime studios in recent years. So what’s next for the legendary studio? In a statement on it’s website, the studio expressed it’s drive to continue forward with animation “for the whole world,” which not only signals a desire to return to its roots with universally adored animation, but also might imply being subcontracted by Western studios - something which is becoming increasingly common with Polygon Pictures recently heading up the new Star Wars: Resistance animated series and Kamikaze Douga’s work on Batman Ninja. While we might not see much from the studio in the short term as they adapt to their new surroundings, I hope that this change allows them to recover from their rocky recent years, and to return as a studio that will do the legacy of their former namesake justice.|Gainax, Gaina, Gainax Fukushima, Gaina Fukushima, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Evangelion
14149|2018-08-21|12:00||http://otaquest.com/vinland-saga-anime-release/| News | N/A | ‘Vinland Saga’ Anime Reveals Staff, Key Visual, 2019 Release Date | Vinland Saga is getting an all-new anime adaptation sometime in 2019, as revealed earlier this week alongside an incredible new key visual. |The announcement of an anime adaptation of Makoto Yukimura’s legendary manga Vinland Saga took many by surprise when it first arose, especially due to the long-shared ideology that the series is largely unadaptable for a number of reasons. If there was ever anyone brave enough for the task, however, it was going to be Attack on Titan and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress producers WIT Studio, which is no surprise given their similarly visceral past productions. The announcement came in March of this year, and we’ve finally gotten some movement on the project beyond the previously revealed teaser Earlier this week, we saw Studio WIT reveal the first key visual for the anime adaptation, one which sees protagonist Thorfinn sitting on a typical Viking boat amidst a snowy landscape, which definitely seems to capture the aesthetic of the series. The key visual also reveals a 2019 release date for the adaptation: Even more exciting than the key visual and release date, however, are the four key staff members that have been attached to the project. Directing the series will be Yabuta Shuuhei, who previously directed the Inuyashiki anime. While that series was underwhelming in many ways, his close relationship with WIT Studio through his CG work on such projects as Attack on Titan should ensure that production proceeds smoothly. In charge of the series composition is Seko Kouji, currently hard at work on the anime adaptation of BANANA FISH, which is great so far. Handling the scripts will be Kenta Ihara, whose previous work on Youjo Senki was a large part of what made the series so fun. Finally, drawing up the character designs will be Takahiko Abiru, who has served as animation director on several episodes of 2011’s Hunter x Hunter and The Ancient Magus’ Bride. The key staff also shared some comments on Twitter, with all of them expressing what an honor it is to be working on an adaptation of such an excellent manga. 【スタッフコメント発表！】 アニメ制作スタッフからコメントが届きました！https://t.co/PUdlNy8meJ #VINLAND_SAGA pic.twitter.com/PwuVh68y9Z — TVアニメ「ヴィンランド・サガ」公式 (@V_SAGA_ANIME) 20 August 2018 While it’s good that the staff is passionate about the project, they certainly have a lot of work ahead of them. With artwork as detailed and visceral as Vinland Saga, they may have to cut quite a few corners given how strict content guidelines are on Japanese broadcast television - which risks the adaptation being a lesser version of the original. We’ve also still had no announcement that the project won’t be animated in 3DCG, and WIT’s hiring of several staff members experienced in 3D animation doesn’t do much to alleviate those fears. For the sake of the series, I hope that they can sort these problems out before it’s 2019 premiere.

Starting September 1st and running through the 9th at Cafe Space Roppongi Hills in Tokyo, new art pieces from a selection of different artists will appear on display along with (for the first time ever) the original colored pieces from legendary Pokémon artist & designer Ken Sugimori. The artists that have been selected come from a wide range of artistic mediums including children's books, fashion, manga, and even cookies & sweets! In addition to the original art pieces, there is going to be a wide range of merchandise available featuring pieces from each of the artists. A sampling of the items available, as well as the artists, can be found at the official website for the cafe. A special, limited edition book featuring art from a variety of designers, information on each of the Eevee forms, as well as insight on the creation of each, will also be available at the event and the Pokémon Center online store. The gallery space includes a cafe which will be serving a selection of soft serve sundaes with toppings inspired by each of Eevee's forms. Caramel, Blueberry, Matcha, Mango, and others represent not only the color spread but also the variety that Eevee embodies in the games! While there is also a full-size Pokémon cafe opened up in Tokyo now, events like these excite me far more since it seems to be more intimate and the artwork is a major draw. It's unfortunate that it's running for such a short period of time, but if we're lucky they might tour around the country of Japan and give even more people an opportunity to check out the original art pieces in person.

14138|2018-08-20|14:00||http://otaquest.com/gatebox-assistant-impression/| News | N/A | [Impression] Gatebox Offers Human Connection in AI-Focused World | We made our way over to the Gatebox offices in Akihabara to try out the companies in-home AI assistant that aims to bring a human touch to everyday tasks. |Within the current landscape of in-home artificial intelligence, regardless of whether you use Google Home or Amazon Echo, there's an ever-present element of machine interaction involved -- never does it feel like you're actually talking to another person. That's something Akihabara-based tech startup Gatebox wishes to address. Just months out from the launch of their debut commercial product, we were given a hands-on opportunity to try out the device in a simulated apartment space. Given roughly 25 minutes with the device itself, we were given the crash course on just what the Gatebox is capable of. While I've been a long-time fan of the Gatebox project, the concept of living with a virtual character wasn't something that particularly struck a chord with Eddie. That being said, we both went into the room with a clear mindset and our own angles, and we'd be pretty hard-pressed to find too many negative things to say about what was ultimately an incredible device. You can find our full impressions on the device below: Lachlan: When we actually arrived at the Gatebox office, I really didn't know what to expect. I'd seen all the trailers, I'd felt all the excitement, but I just didn't know what I'd walk out of the office actually thinking about the product first announced two years ago. With that being said, after actually getting some hands-on time with the Gatebox device, it became abundantly clear to me just what they're going for with this device, and just what areas they're putting real emphasis into. While most in-home AI devices look good, the Gatebox comes in with a design that's nothing short of incredible; seriously, I can't stress enough just how sleek the actual device looks. From its outbound projectors to its internal display, Gatebox offers an experience that's aimed at breaking the barrier between AI and human interaction. Upon entering the pre-prepared room, Gatebox staff were quick to introduce us to the devices main character, Azuma Hikari, who I ended up spending the majority of my time interacting with. She's a self-described ideal wife, whose personality exists as the cornerstone of Gatebox's deeply-integrated identity. Much to my surprise, I was actually one of the first foreigners they'd ever had in the office, so I feel like they were just as excited as I was to see how Azuma Hikari reacted to my butchered Japanese ability. To our surprise, however, she understood me -- for the most part. Functionality wise, we spent the majority of our time enjoying some idle chit-chat as if I had just come home from a day at work. This resulted in situations where Gatebox would dim the lights with ease, offer a toast for our simulated three-month anniversary, and also set an alarm for the morning after. While my accent did get in the way sometimes, it wasn't long before Azuma Hikari was able to address the situation and get the job done -- though I'll definitely be looking out for the planned English-language release. Overall the Gatebox device itself was incredibly solid, with native discussion receiving a snappy response from Azuma Hikari. Discussions with the company CEO revealed that the purpose of the device isn't to make your life necessarily entirely more convenient, but rather, it's meant to integrate real interactions that you would have with a real companion. With that thesis in mind, I walked out quite impressed by the Gatebox device as a whole, and I'm especially hopeful for what the company brings out in the future. Eddie: I'll begin my thoughts by stating that I am absolutely not the target audience for this exact product. I'm not particularly interested in home automation devices, and while the character is really well designed, I'm not a member of the fandom that would be attracted to the product for that reason. That being said, as a general enthusiast of technology, I don't have anything negative to say about the Gatebox device, especially after we were given more insight into the larger scale concept. To call it a home automation device is actually quite misrepresentative of the intention of Gatebox. It really is meant to be something that you can have a real interaction with, that properly greets you when you arrive home, and makes an empty apartment a welcoming environment. I didn't participate in the demo personally, but watching Lachlan interact with Hikari was very entertaining. The functions available during the demo were limited, but watching her move around the screen and respond to his words made me think of the long term possibility of this kind of device. It's the first one I've encountered with a real personality to it, and in many ways makes the sci-fi depictions of holographic AI seem within reach. For the overall design of the unit itself, it's absolutely gorgeous. It's incredibly sleek with beautiful lighting accents and a futuristic, capsule-like appearance. It's the kind of thing that no one should feel ashamed of having on their shelf, especially when it's not actively being interacted with. When Hikari is asleep, or not responsive, a really slick particle effect appears in her place. If you're worried about someone who isn't in the know judging you for owning a Gatebox, you should put any fears to rest because the unit will look incredible to absolutely anyone who looks at it. While we're still a few short months out from the commercial release of the Gatebox product, which is slated for a release later this year at a price point of 150,000 yen (~$1360 USD), the future of Gatebox is definitely looking promising -- especially in their intended market.

With today's report, however, we saw something we honestly weren't expecting at all -- following the release of Monster Hunter: World on PC via Steam, the latest entry into the long-running franchise has shipped over 10 million copies worldwide, making it Capcom's best-selling game in the company's history. With the cultural phenomenon that is Monster Hunter having launched over 14 years ago in Japan, the series has long seen high sales and consistent returns, earning the series a lifetime cumulative sale count of over 50 million units as of August 20, 2018. Occupying a massive one-fifth of that total, however, is the game-changing Monster Hunter: World, a title that is likely to cement the franchise as a consistent top-performer both within and outside of Japan for years to come. It's reported that within the first week of Monster Hunter: World's launch on PC via Steam, the title received over 2 million additional sales solely from that platform. Currently available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, it'll be interesting to see just how much further the game can go.

Dubbed the TENGA Robo, the red and white-striped little fella comes in at a tiny 95 mm tall, about half the size of a real TENGA, and features various movable parts allowing him to disguise as either a TENGA or a more intuitive robot form. Set to release in December 2018, the robot will offer either a standard or "boom set" model at various price ranges. Good Smile Company has long been known for their high-quality goods and figurines, including the long-running Nendoroid series for which they're most commonly known for in the West. They've made some pretty outlandish collaborations in the past, but this just about sits on top of anything else; something I'm completely all about. Currently available for order reservation up until September 19, the figure will release in Japan during December 2018 where I'll definitely be picking one up for myself.

After a surprise showing at Pokemon Go Fest in Chicago, IL, the generation 2 Mythical Pokemon Celebi is finally going to be available to players worldwide starting on August 20th. Similar to the quest to catch Mew in-game, players will need to complete a series of in-game tasks to reach the ability to catch Celebi in the game. Fear not though, if you still haven't caught Mew and don't want to waste any time, players who have reached at least the 3rd level of the Mew special research quests can start their journey toward Celebi. In addition to the new Mythical Pokemon, more Pokemon from the Gold & Silver region of Jhoto will be coming to the game for players to catch. Since completing your Pokedex in the game is still one of the main tasks (Gotta Catch 'Em All!), this is going to be a very welcome addition for many players. New Style and accessory options for your avatar are going to be added as well. With the upcoming Let's Go Pikachu & Let's Go Eevee version of Pokemon for Nintendo Switch featuring linking capabilities with Pokemon Go, this seems like a perfect time to drum up excitement around the game once more. I myself just started playing pretty heavily again last week after nearly 2 years of absence and I'm finding all of these new additions to be a very welcome surprise. Where I had originally written the game off as being a very passive experience (I'm a huge fan of the traditional handheld games), many of the additions made since the beginning of 2018 have really fleshed out the Pokemon Go experience for the better and drawn me back. If you haven't played it in a while, it might just be the perfect time to jump back in!|Pokemon, Celebi, Pokemon Go, Niantic, Research, mobile game

The design for each of the pieces is unbelievably wild, and I'm definitely eyeing-off the waist pouch as a must-cop once it drops.

Accompanying the release of Azur Lane's open beta, an all-new trailer was uploaded to the title's official YouTube channel and Twitter account, giving players a taste of what's to come before they jump into the game. Highlighting the game's story and characters, the trailer can be streamed below: Available as of today, Azur Lane's open beta is possibly the best time to dive into this world of ships and carriers, especially with all data from the beta carrying over to the final release. There's a number of milestones that were met in regards to pre-registrations on the Azur Lane website too, meaning early adopters of the game can reap in the rewards of some pretty convenient benefits. It feels like every few years Japan's hyper-vibrant doujin scene heads towards an all-new trend to quench their thirst for fresh character designs, clean illustrations, and time-blowing gameplay. Over the years we saw titles such as Touhou and Kantai Collection exist at the forefront of the scene, but there's absolutely no name as big as Azur Lane right now in the doujin arena. With Azur Lane, we see a combination of these two frontrunners, offering slight bullet-hell elements mashed in with the characteristics of a title like Kantai Collection -- except developer Tencent is making strides to allow the game to be as accessible as possible.

If you've ever been craving a bucket of McNuggets and the substantially smaller 15-piece box doesn't cut it, you're in luck -- if you're anywhere near the idol group's home city of Niigata, that is. Set to launch at some 38 stores throughout the city of Niigata, the NGT48 bucket is about as large as they come. This certainly isn't the first time McDonald's has teamed up with the Japanese idol group to bring forward the NGT48 bucket, with the first-time collaboration taking place in 2015, but that doesn't make its return any less exciting. Much like the original running, the return of the NGT48 bucket brings with it new trading cards which can only be collected in full should you eat roughly 1,200 chicken nuggets across 25 buckets in total. Priced at 1,800 yen per bucket, the collaboration is set to launch in the city of Niigata from December 1, 2018.

14114|2018-08-15|14:00||http://otaquest.com/supergroupies-steins-gate-collab/| News | Anime | Reformed Chuunibyou Okabe Rintarou Inspires Stylish Menswear | Japanese fashion brand SuperGroupies is teaming up with Steins;Gate for a timeline-breaking fashion collection inspired by mad scientist Rintarou himself. |Japanese designers SuperGroupies have been instrumental in transforming the often uncool and unfashionable realm of anime-inspired clothing into something more, well, acceptable with their anime collaboration collections; but how have they approached the reformed chuunibyou Okabe Rintarou of Steins;Gate 0? Taking inspiration from Okabe’s black shirt with a red pen in the chest pocket that he constantly wears during the events of Steins;Gate 0 (seriously, do you not own any other clothes?), SuperGroupies have created a unique bag as well as more of a straight up replica of his shirt. The common feature here is the inclusion of a red pen, which while certainly pays homage to Okabe’s outfit. The fact that it is fabric and not a real pen does look a little strange. Particularly when it comes to the shirt, as you could pretty easily just tuck a real pen in a black shirt to get the same effect. Thankfully, only these two items feature the strange fabric pen, and the coat that goes with the shirt and bag looks great as a result. It’s a pretty normal black overcoat until you look at the right arm, which is emblazoned with the logo of the Future Gadget Lab, and the left cuff, which displays a divergence reading. And while I think that the above three pieces would look best when worn all together, there are some accessories that you could definitely pick up on their own to express your love for Steins;Gate. One of these is a wallet that evokes the red design of Okabe’s smartphone, and once more features the Future Gadget Lab logo as well as an insignia that reads “Lab Member 001” - Okabe’s number. Finally, the most expensive but probably most impressive piece in the collection is this Amadeus-themed watch. The design is nice and simple yet refined, and also brings to mind the first ending of the series, in which Okabe laughs maniacally while being rotated on top of a gear. Not sure if that was the intention, but it looks great regardless. The watch does cost 30,000 yen, however, so keep that in mind if you’re thinking of picking this or any of the other pieces up. SuperGroupies’ prices are always on the high side, but the level of quality you get for this money is unmatched.

Taking place over a total of three days, each embodying a different aspect of MOGRA's vibrant culture, the club took to their numerous social media platforms to announce just what talent we'd be seeing when celebrations kick off at the end of the month from August 24. Kicking things off on day one, we see a heavy focus on the anime aspect of the club; easily the roots of the clubs long life in the Akihabara district of Tokyo. It's a long list of club veterans, most of whom have been with the club for quite an extended period dropping some of the most iconic anime themes within the club's confined walls. Taking place on August 24, information on day one can be found below: ● Entry Door ¥3,500 (1 Drink) ▼DJ ヒゲドライバー IOSYS [D.watt feat. miko SET] Taku Inoue DJ 汐りんご DJ kaw*kaw colate Mura SAAYA 全力全開ブレイカーズ とんとん DJ ZERO 小太郎 Eiry ニコル ▼VJ くなはら おちゃ ちゅん SHOOON Taking things to another level, the second day of celebrations looks to turn the basement floor of MOGRA and turn it into a moshpit offering a lineup of DJs and talent worthy of some of the craziest raves. We see hardcore legends such as DJ Shimamura collide with dancefloor heaters such as Carpainter all within the span of nine hours.

From legendary producers such as kz (livetune) and Pa's Lam System, all the way to hard-hitting DJs such as DJ WILDPARTY, the third day is set to be something incredible. Even club MOGRA owner D-YAMA is coming through for the fun with a set of his own on the final day.

With over 40 years of experience under Comiket's belt, however, it appears even the legendary event can still struggle under the weight of over 530,000 attendees from around the world. So with less than three years until Comiket hits the three-digit counter, just how much bigger can the community-driven event get? For those unfamiliar with the history of Comiket in Japan, the long-running event has acted as the perfect breeding ground for both established and amateur artists alike to get their names out there since its original conception. Offering a bi-annual marketplace event where creatives can sell their original and fan-made works, there's perhaps no event more responsible for developing fan communities in Japan than Comic Market. Whether its Touhou, Vocaloid, or even more recent trends like Azure Lane, there's never a shortage of content at Comiket. It's not uncommon for Summer Comiket to host fewer individuals than its more fairly weathered Winter Comiket counterpart, but Comiket 94 certainly did a fair job of bringing in the numbers. With over 32,000 circles selling creations, there was most definitely something for just about everybody of the 530,000 who attended. While the highest attendance count for a Comiket event took place during 2013 at Comiket 84, hosting a total of 590,000 attendees, one can only wonder how long it'll be before we crack the 600,000 mark.|Comiket, Comic Market, Comiket 94, Big Sight, Tokyo Big Sight

It's only natural then that I'd be excited to see announcements that he's fresh off the press for the upcoming Made in Abyss films, and already getting on Twitter to announce his involvement as a composer on the upcoming The Rising of the Shield Hero animated series. Honoured to announce I am the composer for The Rising of the Shield Hero (Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari). This is by far the biggest soundtrack I've done to date. Lots and lots of music... an insane amount of musicians... more to come... @shieldheroanime pic.twitter.com/xYUkPjAx88 — Kevin Penkin (@kevinpenkin) 9 August 2018 Kevin Penkin’s contributions to the Made in Abyss anime adaptation were instrumental in elevating the most poignant scenes and filling the world with a mystical wonder that wasn’t present in the original manga, and his soundtrack for Under the Dog was easily the best part of the project, so no matter the source material, I’d always be excited to hear new music from him. But even more than that, Penkin’s rare position as a foreigner working in anime makes him worth keeping an eye on. After all, limiting anime staff to only those living and working in Japan denies future anime of talented individuals that would greatly improve the project. Another name that springs to mind is Austrian animator Bahi JD, who’s animation cuts have always stood out and improved the overall project, whether it be his first job on Kids on the Slope or his latest work on FLCL: Progressive. In this sense, Penkin and others’ efforts are helping to improve anime in the long term, so I couldn’t be happier that he is continuing to work in the industry. Only adding to this, Penkin’s genius towards dark and somber soundtracks seems like a perfect fit when it comes to the dark tone of the Shield Hero series, which is often praised as a dark isekai story in the same vein as Re;Zero. While I can’t say that that particular subgenre is my cup of tea, if it allows Penkin to continue to do what he does best, then I can’t complain. I’ll just be waiting to see what kind of magic he can work this time. Penkin joins director Takao Abo and others at Kinema Citrus for The Rising of the Shield Hero, which is set to premiere it’s first episode at Crunchyroll Expo this September.|Kevin Penkin, The Rising of the Shield Hero

By navigating to the “playlists” tab, you can see that, as of the time of writing, episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho, Slam Dunk, Fist of the North Star, and Kinnikuman are available for streaming - provided you access it from a Japanese IP address. As if that wasn’t enough, Weekly Shonen Jump also plans to add new episodes every weekday, not only allowing fans to watch the above four series in full, for free, but also many other amazing Jump shows, including One Piece, Naruto, Dr. Slump, to name but a few. When certain shows will be added will be conveyed using the channel’s official Twitter account, so keep your eye on that for more. You’ll be able to watch these shows on the channel until March 31 next year, so you’ll have plenty of time to sit back, relax, and take in some good old Jump anime goodness - whether it’s for reveling in nostalgia or discovering something new. I’d definitely recommend checking out Yu Yu Hakusho if you haven’t had a chance to see it already.|Weekly Shonen Jump, Shonen Jump, Dragon Ball

The original project has been in development since 2014, As the title suggests, the story will take place in the Kabukicho area of Shinjuku-ward, which is known for its vibrant nightlife as well as for it’s more unsavory elements. If you played any of the Yakuza games, then it is Kabukicho upon which Kamurocho is based, which should help you understand what kind of place it is if you haven’t had the opportunity to visit it yet. Using this setting, the original anime series will tell the story of a “bizarre murder case,” and from the looks of the Sherlock Holmes-esque character in the key visual released alongside the announcement, it seems that the characters will be trying to solve that case: Other than the above key visual, we don’t have much more information as to the story or characters, but what we do know is that a lot of the key staff positions have already been filled - suggesting that it may air sooner than we think. Directing the series is Ai Yoshimura (Cheer Boys, Dance With Devils), handling the series composition is Kishimoto Taku (91 Days, Usagi Drop), and penning the character designs will be Yabaki Toshiyuki (Persona 5, Joker Game). Production I.G. has had a good history with producing original anime, with Psycho-Pass being a keen critical favorite to this day. Combine this with the already interesting setting of Kabukicho, and it’s safe to say that I’m keen to see how this project will turn out.|Shinjuku-ku Kabukicho, Kabukicho, Production I.G.

Many of you will have seen the original series, so how about checking the theatrical entries for some new ground? Luckily for us, Toei Animatiohasve recently unveiled their plans to release previous Dragon Ball movies on Blu-ray for the first time ever. While not all of the movies will be getting a Blu-ray release, the most important (and best) will be - from the first Dragon Ball Z movie, Dead Zone, all the way up to the first movie featuring Broly, Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan. Even some classic movies from the pre-Z days will be seeing the light of day with Curse of the Blood Rubies, Sleeping Princess in the Devil’s Castle and Mystical Adventure all getting a Blu-ray release. These new Blu-ray's will be based on a rescan of the original cels, allowing the movies to be upscaled to 1080p HD without affecting the quality of the picture. The technology allowing this to be performed has advanced considerably in recent years, and I can confirm for myself that these new rescans look absolutely incredibly from my experience watching the 4K-remaster of Ashita no Joe 2. Toei plans to release eight Blu-ray's collecting 17 movies from 1986 to 1996 as of the time of writing, but they may decide to do more if sales are good. The first wave is available from November 2, so if you’re hankering for more Dragon Ball, definitely consider picking them up.|

14090|2018-08-10|15:00||http://otaquest.com/megalo-box-roundup/| News | Anime | 'Megalo Box' Isn't Just Your Average 'Joe' | When Megalo Box was announced, I couldn’t be more excited. Now over a month since it finished airing in Japan, I've collected my thoughts on the Ashita no Joe tribute series. |When Megalo Box was initially announced, I couldn’t possibly be more excited. Sure, the animated series looked incredibly cool with its gritty animation and kickass soundtrack, but most importantly I was happy to see one of my favorite series of all time get a revival after 50 years. I'm talking, of course, about Ashita no Joe, a series that has held a place in the hearts of many since it first entered the ring in 1968. The reasons I love Ashita no Joe are numerous, but the main reason has to be lead character and series namesake Yabuki Joe himself. Far from being a perfect paragon of justice like so many of his shonen protagonist peers, Joe was flawed - always striving to become something better, always striving for tomorrow. This was a theme that really struck a chord with me, something that still resonates strongly even to this day.. Going into Megalo Box, perhaps I was held back by my love for Ashita no Joe. In my eyes, anything that took the name of such a masterpiece and proudly displayed it by marketing itself as an Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary project needed to do that name justice by being as good as the work it hoped to honor. What I didn’t expect, however, was that Megalo Box would hold a charm of its own in some very different ways, swinging above its weight and landing some really solid hits along the way. Perhaps most importantly, Megalo Box is not the story of Yabuki Joe in the cybernetic future. It paves an original path of its own with a protagonist unmistakable to the series. Junk Dog is not flawed like Joe - sure, he gets angry and acts foolishly at times - but his personality is hardly constructed to be as affrontish as Joe’s. He’s the typical shonen protagonist that we know and love, and never is this archetype challenged as a character flaw like in Joe’s case. Simply put, Junk Dog is not nearly as interesting as Joe, but that doesn’t really matter; the focus of Megalo Box is not on its own protagonist. In fact, the focus of the story really seems to be the character of Yuri, and how his relationship with Junk Dog changes, transforming from a caged animal into a stray dog. Within this relationship is the main “point” of Megalo Box, that you should live for your own desires and stay true to yourself above all else. And while this point does signify some of Joe’s original exploration of the proletarian spirit, as the class difference between Junk Dog and Yuri clearly affects their differing outlooks, it’s all merely subtext and not an overt message. The fact that the series focuses more on Yuri than anyone else is a testament to the project’s origins as a Rikishi Toru origin story, as Yuri’s own story does closely resemble Rikishi's - from having to endure intense pain to fight his opponent, to his subservient status to his proprietor. But the series isn’t content to simply follow Rikishi's template, taking decisions of its own and diverting from it as a result - namely allowing the two rivals to enjoy a friendship after their match as equals. Was I wrong to expect that Megalo Box would be more like Ashita no Joe? Perhaps. But ultimately, the 50th-anniversary series has it’s own identity - despite having clear roots in the original masterpiece. The best part is, it only took me thirteen weeks to realize that that might not be such a bad thing, after all. If you're yet to watch it yourself, Megalo Box is now available for streaming on Crunchyroll.|Megalo Box, Ashita no Joe, Tomorrow's Joe

In Japan, they have quickly risen to become figures of national recognition, and there’s some serious investment going to ensure the continuation of this industry. The latest company to make a foray into the industry is Wright Flyer Live Entertainment (WFLE), who have entered with a bold plan - give anyone and everyone the tools to become a VTuber. They plan to do this with the launch of their own Virtual YouTuber streaming service - coyly named ‘REALITY.’ The service will allow VTubers to live stream directly to subscribers with a plethora of special tools to allow more direct interaction with fans, such as “gifts” that can be given in the form of accessories and outfits. The service also easily accommodates collaborations between VTubers by allowing them to appear together on the same stream through the service - something that previously wasn’t possible unless both faces behind the avatar were together in real life. Furthermore, WFLE plan to deliver on their promise to let anyone become a VTuber by not only giving them the tools to livestream but also by creating their avatar - something that was previously only possible by using proprietary applications. By using the ‘REALITY Avatar’ service, creators can not only create their own avatar from scratch, but this avatar will also be immediately usable in the REALITY application itself, making it even easier for fledgling VTubers to make their debut. Although the service will be available for anyone to use, WFLE also announced their partnership with several production companies, such as Aniplex, King Records, and Bushiroad, to help find new talent through more traditional methods like auditions. Partnering with such influential companies marks a serious commitment on their part to developing the VTuber scene, and I’m sure that they’ll be able to find lots of untapped potential through their collaboration with these companies. In general, the launch of a service specifically for VTubers was probably only a matter of time. It's no secret that YouTuber has had its fair share of problems for creators, and it doesn't look like that trend is going to be letting up any time soon, Whether or not WFLE’s initiative will solve these problems or not remains to be seen, but I’m certainly eager to see how it goes. Those interested in digging even further, REALITY is available for download in Japan now via its official website.|Virtual YouTuber, Reality, Vtuber, Kizuna Ai, Kaguya Luna

There will be screenings with both English subtitles/Japanese audio, as well as screenings with the English dub, with the former taking place on September 6 and the latter on September 10 nationwide.

Following the release of Perfect Blue, the creative would go on to bring life to films such as Millennium Actress, Paprika, Paranoia Agent, and Tokyo Godfathers before his untimely death in 2010.

While Square Enix has largely been silent regarding the game's status on Nintendo's hybrid console, a recent stage appearance from series creator Yuji Horii has detailed that the game might be taking the stage at Tokyo Game Show from September 20 - 23. Going on stage at the end of “Family Classic Concert: World of Dragon Quest” in Japan earlier today, Yuji shared “I can’t really speak about it, but it is progressing smoothly.” in regards to the Nintendo Switch release of DRAGON QUEST XI. Following this, the creator went on to say “I have a feeling we’ll have a variety of announcements around Tokyo Game Show, but just how much we will say...”, further adding to the possibility of an announcement surrounding the Nintendo Switch release. While this is exciting for those in Japan, Yuji Horii made no mention of an international release for the Switch version of the game.

Officially confirmed via Bandai Namco Europe, both Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun on Nintendo Switch and Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session! on PlayStation 4 will contain the entire Japanese tracklisting, untouched and unaltered. While previous international releases from the franchise were filled with tracks deemed "appropriate" for an international audience, it's refreshing to see Bandai Namco embracing their roots and bringing a more legitimate experience to the West. We're still a couple of months out from the release of both Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun on Nintendo Switch and Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session! on PlayStation 4, but English-language patches have already gone live on international Switch consoles.

Ultimate Direct | From the inclusion of Castlevania's own Simon Belmont to Donkey Kong antagonist King K. Rool, here's everything we learned from today's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Direct. |With today's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Nintendo Direct coming to an end, there's most definitely a whole lot of information to digest. From the inclusion of legendary Castlevania characters Simon Belmont and Richter Belmont, all the way to Donkey Kong antagonist King K. Rool, there's a whole lot going on in the world of Smash. After watching the Direct live in a lounge room surrounded by some of my best friends -- who also happen to be some of the biggest Super Smash Bros. fans I know. Let's discuss the elephant in the room first of all; yes, Luigi absolutely is dead. Death came and took the Green Man away from us, and now he is no longer alive. On the real though, here's everything we know about the upcoming Super Smash Bros. Ultimate title on Nintendo Switch. During today's Direct, it was announced that the title would feature two new core fighters, and an additional three echo fighters, though it remains unknown if that number will increase before the game releases. Additional Characters Simon Belmont (Castlevania) King K. Rool (Donkey Kong) Additional Echo Fighters Richter Belmont (Castlevania) Dark Samus (Metroid) Chrom (Fire Emblem) In a series first, Ultimate will allow players to either display the entire roster with echo fighters given their own individual icons or allow for echo fighter icons to stack for a more compressed roster. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will also contain the largest stage roster in the series' history, with a total of 103 stages after the inclusion of today's announcements and before DLC. Some of those announcements included the likes of Dracula's Castle, New Donk City Hall, and "Gamer". Additionally, all stages will be available from the moment you start the game and can be enjoyed even in 8-player mode. The game also looks to shake up the way you play, offering a substantial roster of game types with unlimited customizability over numerous fields. Whether you're enjoying the new "Squad Strike" mode which allows for either 3v3 or 5v5 brawls, or "Tournament Mode" in a whopping bracket of up to 32 players, you'll be spending just as much perfecting your game style as you will actually playing the game. We additionally saw the addition of a number of new assist trophies and Pokémon, only further adding to the craziness of the title. Those who are mostly in it for the music will be pleased to find out that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate features a mind-blowing 900+ song tracklist, allowing for screen-off listening, as well as playlist creation and various other functionalities. Sakurai wasn't shy in sharing that if all that music was played in a single sitting, you'd have over 28 hours of songs on your hands. There are plenty more announcements that were shared, and honestly speaking, words simply can't put them to justice. When you've got a moment, be sure to treat yourself to the latest Direct video above. Set to release for Nintendo Switch on December 7, 2018, we're sure we'll be seeing plenty more Super Smash Bros.

Earlier this week Nintendo decided to turn the hype up to eleven by dropping an all-new teaser trailer on their official YouTube channel. It's as stylistic as it is fresh, and Neku, Shiki, and the whole crew are looking as good as ever. Running almost two minutes in length, the latest trailer introduces viewers to all of the characters in the series while also highlighting its story-based gameplay. Originally released on Nintendo DS in 2007, The World Ends with You has long been a fan favorite amongst a global audience. Set in the city of Shibuya, Tokyo, protagonist Neku wakes up without a single memory besides his name. With the Final Remix version of the game, players will be invited to relive Neku's journey once more in their share of single player or co-op action.

Earlier today we saw Virtual Youtuber duo KMNZ throw their hat into the ring with their debut single "VR - Virtual Reality", a hip-hop banger produced by none other than Tokyo-based trackmaker Snail's House. While the virtual-duo have seen themselves collaborate a number of times in the past, the release of "Virtual Reality" marks their first original release since they launched the KMNZ project in May 2018. While Snail's House has been crafting his signature sound for years now, fans would be hard-pressed finding too many tracks the musician has worked on featuring actual vocals. With the release of "Virtual Reality", however, KMNZ have invited listeners to take part in a rare opportunity featuring their hard-hitting flow. The song took no time hitting the #1 spot on the Japanese hip-hop charts too, undoubtedly because of its unique appeal and charm.

Bringing in that excitement even more so, SEGA decided to share a few more screenshots from the upcoming release; they're certainly not as glamorous as the visuals of Yakuza Kiwami 2, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be any less excited about them. Showcasing Yakuza 3's "Underground Coliseum" minigame, the new screenshots give us a look at Kiryu fighting his way through waves of enemies in a variety of different battle styles. There are two modes to the minigame, with the first having you fight your way through solo using a number of items offered to you, where the second allows you to fight tag-team with different characters you've met throughout your travels. With SEGA's long-running Yakuza series receiving widespread success both in its home country of Japan and internationally, we're constantly reminded of just how far behind the game's English-language releases really are. Just two days before the release of Yakuza 3's HD remaster in Japan, we've still got a few weeks before we're even able to get our hands on Yakuza Kiwami 2, a title originally released in Japan during December 2017. I can't be too upset though, I'm still more than grateful we're even able to get our hands on the series in the first place. Set to release on PlayStation 4 in Japan on August 9, further information on the upcoming HD remaster of Yakuza 3 can be found via the game's official website.|Yakuza, Yakuza 3, Sega, Yakuza 3 PS4

FIRE BALL, MIGHTY CROWN & PKCZ®" is an absolute heater, flawlessly merging together the talents of everyone involved to keep you moving. Both songs are undoubted summer anthems within their respective genre, however, and it'll be impossible not to hear these while strolling around Tokyo throughout the rest of the season. In the second track, " Let’s Feel High feat. MIGHTY CROWN & PKCZ®", we see a much more E-girls focused performance, with PKCZ®'s own VERBAL delivering his own flow alongside world reggae champions MIGHTY CROWN.

14049|2018-08-06|19:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/code-geass-movie-2019/| News | Games | ‘Code Geass’ Sequel Project Announced as a Movie, to Release February 2019 | Following a large-scale revelation throughout both Shinjuku and Akihabara, it was revealed that the upcoming Code Geass project would be an entry into the film universe. |With the legendary mecha soap opera Code Geass announcing it’s takeover of the huge screens overlooking Shinjuku and Akihabara last week, announcing that they'd be sharing some new information about the upcoming sequel project Lelouch of the Resurrection, it’s safe to say that fans were excited leading up to the grand event. What we ended up seeing on those screens, however, certainly drew a mixed reaction from fans. The 180-second announcement started with a lengthy speech by franchise director and creator Goro Taniguchi who dropped several important announcements without batting a single eyelid. The first was that the project would be done in “one piece,” specifically as a theatrical movie and not as a TV series, as many fans were predicting. Furthermore, he revealed a release date of February 2019, which isn’t long to wait at all. This was followed by the below PV, which had its own informative elements despite its short length: We don’t see anything of Lelouch himself in the trailer - despite this supposedly being his “resurrection” - which seems to suggest that this movie will be much more focused on C.C., the enigmatic Geass witch that set the events of the original series in motion. That doesn’t surprise me considering that Lelouch is supposed to be dead, but I’d be even more surprised if Lelouch doesn’t make an appearance during the film at least at some point. C.C.’s narration makes up the majority of the trailer, and during it she hints at a new “movement” after the death of Lelouch, clearly teasing a new antagonistic force. Furthermore, the shot of a boy with strange eyes removing a visor clearly seems to be a Geass user, suggesting that these new antagonists will be Geass-equipped just like Lelouch was. Considering that the nature of Geass and the identity of C.C. was one of the main plotlines not wrapped up in the conclusion of the series during R2, it’d make sense if the movie took the opportunity to do so. That being said, it’s hard to guess the plot of the movie at this point due to the limited amount of footage we were presented with. For all of my excitement just to see the characters of the series in action once more, however, the reaction to the new sequel project has been muted at best. This video taken in Shinjuku during the announcement speaks volumes: While Japanese citizens tend to be more quiet and respectful in public places than your average Westerner, the silence after the trailer says it all. For many fans, simply making one movie isn’t enough - they want to see more of the characters, more of the world, and more of the series that they have come to love. While I hope the movie will be a success, it seems like it will take some effort to please fans - something I’m no doubt Taniguchi is conscious of. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection is scheduled to release in over 120 Japanese cinemas in February 2019.|Code Geass, Lelouch of the Resurrection, Code Geass Movie, Code Geass 2019

But great news came yesterday as the Witch-Hunt translation group took to Twitter and confirmed their permission to translate the project from developer 07th Expansion themselves. [Announcement] We, Witch-Hunt, are pleased to announce we will translate #07thExpansion new #WhenTheyCry series. We are also honored #Ryukishi07 has once again granted us permission to translate his work and expressed his delight regarding that project. #Umineko #RoseGunsDays — クラシカリ (@Klashikari) 1 August 2018 Witch-Hunt has done a great service for the When They Cry community in the past, so it’s great that they have been given the opportunity to do so once again for this highly-anticipated title. The group was originally formed to translate Umineko, the previous entry in the franchise, and did an excellent job in not only bringing over the series to the west way before it’s official release on Steam last year, but also in navigating through the incredibly difficult vocabulary in the script to produce an excellent translation that was largely responsible for growing the Western fanbase to the size it is today. For these efforts Ryukishi07, creator of the franchise, not only gave them permission to translate his work but also named a character in Umineko after them, calling those obsessed with solving the Rokkenjima Massacre in Ange’s Fragment the Witch Hunt. So it’s no surprise to see that Ryukishi has expressed his support and given his permission once more for the team to continue their excellent work with the latest entry in the franchise. That being said, Witch-Hunt is only a small group, so don’t expect their translation to be coming out anytime soon after the game’s release. Although they worked with MangaGamer to produce the translation for the recent release of Umineko on Steam, they’ll be tackling this one alone. They also won’t see the game until we do, upon its tentative release this winter, so it’d be safe to expect a significant delay between the release of the game and Witch-Hunt’s translation. But I’m sure that the team will be pulling out all of the stops to deliver an excellent translation once more.|When They Cry 5, Higurashi, Witch-Hunt, Doujin, Visual Novel, 07th Expansion

While it might still be a little away, what with the recent release of Yakuza 0 on PC via Steam, the report is most specifically mentioning Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, and most importantly noting a currently unannounced PC port of the game right next to the already-available PlayStation 4 version. The long-running Japanese gangster soap opera beat ‘em up series has seen a resurgence in popularity in the West throughout recent years, mostly thanks to the localization of the excellent Yakuza 0 and then the timely release Yakuza Kiwami, a remake of the first game, allowing new fans to get up to speed relatively quickly. This led to PC ports of both Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami, a first for the long-running series, as PC gaming is a much more versatile market in the West than in the series’ homeland of Japan. It's because of this that it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that the latest entry in the series, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, is also coming to PC - at least if the above financial report is anything to go by. With that bit of information, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life will likely join the recently released Yakuza 0 on PC at some point during the third quarter of 2019 if internal plans go well, and if the press surrounding Yakuza 0’s PC port is anything to go by, then it’s sure to be a great port that will further widen the series’ influence so that it can receive the praise that it has deserved for many years.

Drumming up that excitement even more so, the upcoming English-language release of DRAGON QUEST XI received an all-new "The Loyal Companions" character trailer over the weekend, showcasing the heroes of the game, as well as highlighting Akira Toriyama's iconic character designs. Set to release in North America and Europe on September 4 for both PlayStation 4 and PC via Steam, DRAGON QUEST XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age is a continuation of Square Enix's recent push of the massively-influential series in the West. While DRAGON QUEST has always enjoyed a massive following in its home country of Japan, up until recent years it had always struggled to break through into the Western market. Originally released in Japan mid-2017, the game was largely praised by critics who had been following the series since early days. I personally can't wait to get my hands on the upcoming RPG title and can only wish it great success in this post-Final Fantasy XV gaming landscape.

Uploaded to DÉ DÉ MOUSE's official YouTube channel, I've spent a good portion of time freaking out about the shooting location being walking distance from my own house, only adding to the personal excitement of the video. With "be yourself" we see a continuation of DÉ DÉ MOUSE's ongoing foray into the pop music scene, infusing his deep knowledge of electronic production to create a distinctly DÉ DÉ MOUSE sound.

The upcoming sequel to the original Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth title sees characters from Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5 collide in an all-new cinema-like labyrinth where the heroes of all three mainline titles must work together to escape what lies ahead of them in an adorable chibi form. There is currently no announcement of a Western release for the game. Set to release in Japan on November 29, 2018, the upcoming entry into the Persona Q spinoff series has come in hot with both a TVCM and its first PV revealed earlier today. Throughout both videos, we see a particular highlight of the inclusion of Persona 3 Portable's female protagonist, a character absent from the original Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth game. Throughout the PV, we additionally see what appears to be some conflict between the characters of each game, possibly serving as a plot point for the game's story. Possibly one of the most surprising things about this announcement is ATLUS' choice to exclusively release the game on Nintendo 3DS, something I hope changes in the near future. It's especially weird to think that another Persona title is coming out on a Nintendo console that isn't the Switch. One can only hope that ATLUS pulls a Persona 5 on this one and later announces it for Switch like they did P5 for PlayStation 4 after originally announcing it for PlayStation 3. With just a few more months until we can get our hands on Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, we'll be sure to keep you updated with any new information as its announced.

With #PokemonQuest and #PokemonLetsGo, there are so many new ways to explore the world of Pokémon! Trainers can look forward to even more with an all-new core series Pokémon RPG title in development for the second half of 2019! pic.twitter.com/d5uiIpenMI — Pokémon (@Pokemon) May 30, 2018 Originally announced proceeding the announcements of both Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!, The Pokémon Company were quick to share that fans of the series could look forward to an all-new core Pokémon RPG title sometime in the second half of 2019. With that being said, however, Nintendo's latest financial report suggests that the new title won't be released until a more refined "late 2019". Where this likely puts us is around a November 2019 release date, akin to the previous core releases on the Nintendo 3DS. While we've still got quite a while before we actually find too much out about this next core entry into the Pokémon series, with both Nintendo and The Pokémon Company likely holding off until after the release of Let's Go on Nintendo Switch, I'm sure it won't be too much longer before we start seeing news surface. Until then, of course, we'll be sure to keep you posted on any additional Pokémon-related news and information. Source: Siliconera, Serebii|Pokemon

Their EXPG dance studio & school in New York opened to much success, with another installment on the way in Los Angeles, and their involvement with Anime Expo with the 'm-flo presents OTAQUEST LIVE powered by LDH USA' event proved to be a game changer in the way fans perceive music offerings at conventions. Their next conquest has now been revealed and it comes from the expert team of LDH Kitchen; THE ROBATA. Before getting into what sets this new location apart as an end to end entertainment experience, it might be helpful to understand what Robatayaki is as it is the namesake and centerpiece of this new restaurant. Robatayaki refers to a highly specialized form of BBQ wherein the food is cooked on a flat open-hearth grill at varying temperatures depending on the dish being prepared. It takes a highly skilled chef to pull this dish off perfectly, but when done right it is quite the delicacy. While not commonly found outside of Japan, it's a very popular form of preparation in its country of origin. With that out of the way, I can begin to explain the experience ahead of visitors who find themselves able to visit this one of a kind establishment in Santa Monica, California. The theming of the restaurant is that of fire meeting water, and while the fire component seems rather obvious the way in which this theme is presented to those dining in the restaurant is the perfect contrast for such a traditional method of preparing dishes. The Robata employs a very sophisticated projection mapping system to deliver an evolving show as you dine. From cityscapes to fireworks, to crystalline formations ebbing and flowing, the visuals on display are absolutely master-class; which when you consider LDH's history with visual development shouldn't come as much of a surprise. If my assessment of the restaurant sounds too glowing so far, that's because I had the opportunity to visit prior to its opening on August 1st and check everything out and I was seriously impressed by what I encountered. I wouldn't say that I'm the type who patronizes fine-dining establishments on a regular basis, but I do definitely love food, and what I had a chance to sample upon my visit was nothing less than delicious. I couldn't get enough of the bacon-wrapped mochi or charcoal grilled Tsukune, and you absolutely can't go wrong with any of their steak offerings. They took this very traditional style of food and applied a fine dining aspect to it with a range of dishes that are sure to please every type of pallet. Couple that with their crafted selection of cocktails and other drinks and you have yourself one fantastic meal ahead. Include the visuals found in the restaurant on top of that? It's an amazing experience, unlike anything you'll find anywhere else. LDH Kitchen THE ROBATA opened it's doors to the public on August 1st and is located in Santa Monica, California. Reservations can be made now, although if you want to be among the first to experience LDH's first foray into food in the United States you'll need to move quickly!|LDH Kitchen, The Robata, Los Angeles, Restuarant, Projection Mapping

Released earlier today, CHVRCHES' own "Out Of My Head" features Wednesday Campanella amongst a rich array of synth leads, setting the stage for KOM_I to dominate the track. While Wednesday Campanella has spent these last couple of years slowly working their way into the mainstream North American pop circuit, appearances at SXSW and Camp Flog Gnaw 2017 coming to mind, this is the group's first major inception. The end result might feel more like a CHVRCHES track than anything you'd normally see Wednesday Campanella release -- which isn't a bad thing -- but KOM_I's talents certainly are given plenty of breathing space on this, allowing for a clear distinction of her signature sound. Available for streaming now on all major platforms, you can check out further information on the full release via CHVRCHES' official website.|chvrches, Out of My Head, Wednesday Campanella, Suiyobi no Campanella

USA president Maki Terashima-Furuta, it was revealed that the upcoming Ghost in the Shell anime will take place over two seasons. |During a recent interview with Production I.G. USA president Maki Terashima-Furuta and Production I.G. CEO Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, it was revealed that there's an upcoming Ghost in the Shell anime that will take place over the span of two seasons, featuring a different director for each season. Revealed during an interview with YouTuber "Nuke the Fridge" over at San Diego Comic-Con, the first season is slated to be directed by Kenji Kamiyama, best known for his work on Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, with the second season being handled by Shinji Aramaki who previously worked on legendary properties such as Appleseed. Mentioned from the 21-second point of the interview, Maki Terashima-Furuta begins going into detail about the upcoming anime series, breaking down that it will be taking place over two seasons and a total of 24 episodes. Split into 12 episode seasons, it's admitted that due to the show still being in development, they couldn't quite share just what the two parts will be called. Outside of that not much more information could be shared; though we're sure we'll be seeing plenty more information in the coming months. Until that time, however, we'll be sure to keep you updated if any additional news pertaining to the upcoming series is revealed. |Ghost in the Shell, GitS, Production I.G., Shinji Aramaki, Kenji Kamiyama
14037|2018-08-03|11:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/beatmania-iidx-26-impressions/| News | Games | beatmania IIDX 26 ROOTAGE Location Test Impressions | We attended the first day of the beatmania IIDX 26 ROOTAGE location test and were not disappointed at this first look at the newest entry of the seminal music gaming franchise. |Konami surprise announced the latest version of beatmania IIDX just a few days ago, and this morning at GAME Silk Hat Kawasaki DICE fans from all over the world gathered to be the first to play and see what the future holds. I was on hand along with some friends to check it out, and rather than writing up all of the details that came out of the event (you can find those in spades at bemanistyle.com) I figured it would be more prudent for me to give my impressions of this new entry instead from the standpoint of a fan who has been following the series since the very beginning (literally). Let's get the biggest news out of the way first: Porter Robinson is now officially in the game with the song "Particle Arts" using his Virtual Self alias. It was the first thing we caught when we started reporting on the event over on our twitter account. Fans have been going crazy about it all day, and we are definitely just as excited about this happening. Porter is not shy about how much Konami's BEMANI franchise has influenced him over the years, and this feels like a true "full circle" moment. The chart for the song is pretty solid (although playing on random can be killer as one of our friends encountered today) and the game includes the official music video for the song as well. Moving onto the look & feel of the game this time around. The theme for the new title is extremely pretty and very well executed. As we speculated the other day when the location test was announced the game's theme is that of a database or archive, with the words "IIDX ARCHIVE" appearing at the top of the gameplay screen. The transition screens throughout the game have interlocking triangles throughout and uses a very vibrant color scheme with lots of warm hues. The song select screen has a crystalline kind of look, with rotating server rack/bookshelf amalgamations spinning in the background. More triangular elements tie the transitional screens into the main theme, keeping very consistent from screen to screen. The gameplay screen is the biggest giveaway of the theme with ethernet cables & ports, and a very server rack looking layout at play. All in all, for an unfinished theme it's very clean and well executed. "R" is for Rootage. (It also stands for "Really good design")#IIDX26 #弐寺 pic.twitter.com/hKprWaFaMY — bemanistyle (@bemanistyle) August 3, 2018 Musically this test absolutely surprised me given how "samey" many of Konami's games have felt musically as of late. The 20 songs featured in the test run a wide range of genres, and actually have a very strong sense of nostalgia littered amongst them. It definitely feels like this game is going to end up having some serious throwback vibes upon the final release. I think personally my favorite new track at the test is Dirty Androids "Urban Constellations" which sounded like what we would get if Symphonic Defoggers decided to mash footwork up with what they were known best for in beatmania. Other standouts for me were Nhato's new track "Ember Lights", which shows that he just continues to get better with each new track he releases, KSUKE's "Serious?" (which might have the best new video in the game), and Maozon feat. Kyte's "Twilight Warp" The game also adds a bunch of new features & tweaks to existing mechanics to make the gameplay experience smoother and more fun. The addition of a 10th high speed in the default rage along with some cool additions to the results screen such as being able to see your letter grade for each button and the turntable should make for an interesting way to increase your skill in the game if used right. The cameras that were introduced in beatmania IIDX 25 CANNON BALLERS are being employed to scan QR codes, which looks like they'll be offering more customizability and sharing options for players with a new playlist feature and a special Q-Pro part being distributed at the location test by scanning specific QR codes. All in all, even for a test this version is showing a lot of promise. There wasn't a ton of stuff on display today and some of the songs that appear to have been removed are disappointing to see go, but I'm definitely riding first class on the hype train already. We'll be sure to keep posting updates on the title as they come leading up to the full release later this year. |beatmania, iidx, Konami, Bemani, music game, location test, Impressions

Utilizing a free-to-play model, the game aims to bring that same level of arcade-style entertainment to the living room, without needing to have those 100 yen coins at hand. Accompanying today's release of the game was an all-new trailer, which gives viewers a brief rundown of just what you'll be getting yourself into: The launch is being played out here in Japan as quite the massive deal, and that's probably rightfully so. Even a quick stop into Akihabara today wielded a ridiculously cool viewing of a 1:1 scale unit, complete with LEDs and various other detailing. Pitting players into a large-scale battle arena, mecha units will be battling it out to complete various match-based objectives and events. Gameplay is fast-paced, and definitely very true-to-life when it comes to the pre-existing arcade version of the game.

So while I still can’t believe that such a thing is even happening - the manga seeming to have been cast aside to the dustbin of history - we’ve finally received a new PV for the adaptation along with a broadcast start date, meaning its full steam ahead for the adaptation project. The above trailer doesn’t reveal much more outside of the inciting events of the series, but I’m already excited based on the small snippet of footage in the trailer. Particularly exciting are the character designs, which retain the unique look of Kazuhiro Fujita while giving them a much-needed simplification to look better in motion. This is thanks to the work of character designer Takahiro Yoshimatsu, who has done the same excellent job he did on the 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter. The voice cast is looking excellent as well, particularly Rikiya Koyama as Kato. Also revealed was the series’ broadcast start date of this October, which means we don’t have to wait long at all for what is shaping up to be an excellent adaptation of an excellent manga. Amazon Prime will be streaming the anime overseas, so it’s definitely worth considering securing a subscription to help support this extremely unexpected adaptation.

This was especially proven following the release of an all-new edition of the game themed after the legendary magazine, which is officially on sale in Japan now. This isn’t just your regular surface-level edition of the board game, however, as Takara Tomy have paid extra attention to detail in the redesign. For starters, all of the places on the map have been changed to use panels from Jump manga, such as this excellent Dragonball one: Furthermore, the pieces have been changed to allow you to play as your favorite Jump characters. Black Clover’s Asta, My Hero Academia’s Midoriya, Kochikame’s Ryo-san, Kimetsu no Yaiba’s Tanjirou, One Piece’s Luffy, Haikyuu!’s Hinata, The Promised Neverland’s Emma and Dragonball’s Goku are all present. I’m a bit annoyed at the exclusion of Dr. STONE’s Senku, but I definitely can’t scoff at the lineup of characters available. The Game of Life is something I always end up playing at family gatherings, so the prospect of being able to play a Jump-themed version is an exciting one indeed. The Jump edition is on sale now for just under 5000 yen, so you'll definitely want to pick it up while stocks last, here.|Weekly Shonen Jump, Shonen Jump, The Game of Life, Game of Life Shonen Jump

With the 2016 announcement of Lelouch of the Resurrection, fans were left on the edge of their seat awaiting new announcements, and luckily, it seems like big news will be coming very soon - and in a very public manner. To many, the sight of giant screens above pedestrian crossings is an iconic image of Japan, so it’s no trivial matter that Code Geass will be taking over some of those screens for an announcement on August 3. Specifically, screens in both Shinjuku and Akihabara will be used to show a 210-second announcement at 8pm, which will only be shown once meaning fans won’t want to miss it. 【復活】皆さま、お待たせ致しました。ついに来週8/3（金）の20時に重大なお知らせがございます。詳細は画像をご覧ください。お見逃しのないよう。 sun_コウジロウ #geassp pic.twitter.com/BBcjBxF1Zh — コードギアスプロジェクト (@GEASSPROJECT) 27 July 2018 The above tweet refers to the announcement with the word “Resurrection,” so it’d be safe to assume that the announcement will be about the new sequel project in some shape or form. Whether or not it’ll be entirely about the sequel project remains to be seen, as there could be some more information about the third and final recap movie to broadcast - especially since the movies have been diverting from the original story. That being said, I think it’d be too soon for us to see anything like a PV for the sequel project at this stage. We still haven’t heard anything about the project moving into production beyond confirming core staff, so if we’re going to see some kind of trailer I’d imagine that it’ll be very light on detail and more of a taster reel - perhaps allowing us a brief glance at some of the key characters to get fans excited. Hence why I believe the announcement will feature both news about the third movie and the sequel project - but I’d be happy to be proved wrong. Beyond the story, there is something I do believe the announcement will reveal - what exactly this sequel project will be. After all, we’ve had no confirmation that it will be an animated series, although that is what most fans are assuming the sequel project will be, considering that’s what the original series was. There is an equal chance that it could be a movie or ONA series, a problem that the announcement will most likely address. So this announcement definitely isn’t one to miss, and even if you’re not in Japan to see the announcement on the big screen with all the rest of the fans, then worry not - it’ll be live-streamed on Bandai Channel, AbemaTV as well as LINE LIVE. Those interested in pursuing further information regarding those platforms can head over to the series’ official website.|

If there already wasn't a number of reasons to be excited about the film, the latest trailer is sure to send your hype into overdrive. Uploaded to TOHO Animation's official YouTube channel, the latest Penguin Highway "Special Trailer" showcases the films theme song, "Good Night", as performed by legendary talent Hikaru Utada. Originally penned by Japanese novelist Tomihiko Morimi in 2010 and published by Kadokawa Shoten, the novel went on to receive the prestigious Nihon SF Taisho Award in the year of its release. It might be a little to start throwing statements around, but based on everything we're seeing so far from the film adaptation, I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing a few awards handed over to the anime as well. From the incredible sounds of Hikaru Utada's theme and that gorgeous animation, all the way to that child-like wonder offered only through animation, the latest trailer captivates so much of why I'm excited for Penguin Highway and then so much more. Set to release in theaters across Japan on August 17, Penguin Highway is truly shaping up to be the Summer film you won't want to miss.

Taking place in Kawasaki at GAME Silk Hat Kawasaki Dice from August 3rd through August 5th starting at 9:00 am. For those of you who want to brave the trip out for the chance to be among the first to play this new version of the seminal music game franchise be aware that generally Konami runs their location tests on a ticketing system due to demand and you aren't guaranteed a chance to play. Among the new details we're looking forward to finding out upon the start of this test is a sampling of the new songs to be featured in the game, the theme for the title, as well as hopefully a sneak peak at the interface and new promotional graphics. Longtime fans of the franchise as sure to notice that the title ROOTAGE for this version is an obvious play on the ROOTS26 brand featured on many of GOLI Matsumoto's characters created for the series throughout the years. The title graphic seems to imply something vaguely technology-based, possibly servers or database systems? We can't say for sure given what we know so far, but thankfully the wait to find out won't be too long!|beatmania, iidx, beatmania iidx, Konami, Arcade, music game

Clocking in at an estimated lifetime sale-count of 155 million consoles, the PlayStation 2 still remains the best-selling gaming device of all time.

That being said, many fans were surprised once more last weekend as they discovered they were able to log without using a VPN, suggesting that the ban has been lifted without a formal announcement. For those living in the US/Canada/Taiwan/Hong Kong/Korea, ShinyColors is now accessible! You do still need a Japanese bandainamco id/enza account tho. Play the game here: https://t.co/sVifx6NYyZ#シャニマス pic.twitter.com/GmcENYFBos — ShinyColors_ENG (@ShinyColors_ENG) 26 July 2018 An unofficial Shiny Colors English-language news account then tweeted out the news, and word quickly spread around the community. Many were frustrated at this seemingly counterintuitive move from Bandai Namco Entertainment at launch and were therefore dissuaded from engaging with the game. Hopefully, with this stealth unblocking, the game can flourish among western fans like many other of the iDOLM@STER games. However, it is worth noting that only some countries have had the block lifted from them, with the unofficial English news account reporting that the US, Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea are able to access the game. I was only able to confirm access from the US and Korea by using a VPN, but the account has been trustworthy in the past. Why only certain countries have had the IP block lifted from them is a mystery - particularly baffling is why no European countries have been allowed - but this is still a positive move from Bandai Namco towards addressing one of the biggest flaws of the new game from a Western perspective. That being said, you’ll still need to use a Japanese IP to create an account on the Enza server, so even though returning users were able to log in, new users will still have to use a VPN. It’s not a perfect solution, but I’m still thankful that Bandai Namco has done something to address the situation.

Just last month it was announced that their latest collaboration was bringing a rather unexpected figure from the global streetwear scene in to produce the 11th entry in the "Bikkuriman Legends" series. Hiroshi Fujiwara, a legend in the streetwear community often credited for bringing the Ura-Harajuku fashion style to prominence, has teamed up with Lotte to create special Fragment Design (the name of his studio) versions of popular rare series characters Zeus and Tenshi. The "frag" versions of these two characters are available in standard color versions as well as black & gold chase versions, with the set having released on July 17th. If you've ever been to a Japanese supermarket and bought snacks there's a pretty good chance you've come across Bikkuriman. The chocolate & peanut filled wafer cookie has been a staple for children across Japan since its introduction in 1977. Originally packaged with stickers referred to as "seals" featuring real-world items on them intended so that kids could use to play pranks on their friends, the snack really hit its stride in 1982 when it introduced the "Akuma vs. Tenshi" series of original character seals. This new line of seals included a story element that would be expanded upon by collecting more from the set and focused on mythology from all around the world. The product was so prolific for a time that it became a concern across Japan due to acts of childhood delinquency such as theft along with concerns about the growing value of specific stickers leading to gambling addiction. Over the years Bikkuriman's manufacturer, Lotte, has figured out a way to circumvent these issues and grown the product into a complete powerhouse which has spawned several anime series, video games, and collaborations with prolific properties & real life people. My first encounter with the news of Hiroshi Fujiwara's involvement came with some updates he made on Instagram over the past few weeks. I didn't give them much thought at first, but after looking into it a little more I was determined to get all of his contributions. Upon my recent arrival back in Tokyo last week I rushed out to find as many of these tasty snack/sticker combos as I could, ultimately scoring myself one of the black/gold chase Frag Zeus seal in my 3rd wafer cookie pack. As a collector of a variety of Japanese pop culture goods (including many of the past Bikkuriman collaborations), these new seals immediately appealed to my sensibilities thanks to the design crossover along with the proliferation of the product. I often see older series seals for sale at shops like Mandarake, with some fetching 100,000jpy or more on the second-hand market! These special collaboration seals definitely have a lasting appeal in my opinion, and if you're a fan of great character design as well as the concept of the collaboration with someone as prolific as Hiroshi Fujiwara, you should definitely be on the lookout for this series. Be sure to make sure you're picking up the right set if you do decide to hunt, there are also currently new series featuring characters from Kemono Friends and the long-running Kingdom manga property floating around as well! It's also hard to say how available this edition will be available, especially with the additional allure of the "frag" versions of popular characters bringing more attention from outside the typical fanbase. Bikkuriman Legend series 11 is available now all over Japan for around 100jpy per package.|bikkuriman, hiroshi fujiwara, fragment design, lotte, japanese snack, collectible

It's also been no secret since then that Konami has been extremely heavy-handed in protecting their intellectual property, essentially maintaining an iron grip over certain aspects of the genre due to a number of patents owned by the company. With that being said, it's according to a number of recent Japanese reports that the very patent protecting some of the Beatmania series' most common traits may have expired earlier today on July 31, 2018. 例の特許、ついに今年切れるのか #東方発表会 pic.twitter.com/rKhY9aP2Nm — あおこめ（発表会4お疲れ様でした） (@blue_comment) 20 January 2018 Originally put into effect on July 31, 1998, the patent was given a total applicable period of 20 years; from there the patent would no longer be applicable. What this expiration means for the rhythm gaming space is that a number of different aspects, including the use of certain files and key sounds, will now become widely available to those outside of Konami without the risk of lawsuits. For example, with the patent in place, it wasn't possible for other companies to have sounds triggered when keys were pressed to the rhythm of a song, amongst other details. Registered under Patent No. 2922509, it's worth mentioning that while it appears this patent is expired, Konami is likely to still operate a number of different similar patents for different games in their BEMANI series. What this means for the future of rhythm game releases and updates remains to be seen, however one could only hope it'll allow for more creative freedom in the space.

Coming in hot as the group's 7th studio album, word on "Future Pop" had remained relatively on the down-low until roughly a month ago when we got word of the album's full tracklist, as well as various other snippets of information. Taking that a step further today, the Japanese pop group saw the release of their latest music video for "Let Me Know", the seventh track from "Future Pop". Uploaded in the unfortunately common "short ver." format onto the group's YouTube channel earlier this week, the music video is a relatively down-tempo departure from the group's previous few releases; though the song still packs a punch, offering yet another peek into the direction producer Yasutaka Nakata aims to take on "Future Pop". Featuring a total of 12 songs including previous releases such as "TOKYO GIRL" and "If You Wanna", the upcoming album's full tracklist can be found below: 01. Start-Up 02. Future Pop 03. If you wanna 04. TOKYO GIRL 05. FUSION 06. Tiny Baby 07. Let Me Know 08. Chorairin 09. Mugenmirai 10. Housekino Ame 11. Tenku 12.

With Bandai Namco's latest announcement, however, it would appear the developer is looking to breath fresh life into the rhythm game series, utilizing a simultaneous release of both the most recent Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun! for the Nintendo Switch as well as Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session! on PlayStation 4. Set to release in North America on November 2, 2018, the upcoming release of both Taiko no Tatsujin marks the first English-language release of a Taiko no Tatsujin game since the series' early days. While the news most definitely couldn't be more welcome, it's unfortunate to share that neither the North American or European release of the games will see the physical taiko drum release, meaning those eager to enjoy a more legitimate experience will need to import a drum from Japan. Though it remains to be seen just how Bandai Namco will handle licensing for the various songs within both Drum 'n' Fun! and Drum Session! when they titles are released internationally, one could only hope international fans will be able to jam out to songs like "POP TEAM EPIC" and "Zenzenzense". Though that remains to be known, however, we'll be sure to keep you up to date as further information is revealed in the coming weeks.

Following on from this Yoshiki ditched the piano for his own set of drums, jamming alongside Skrillex to the tune of "Cinema" into an absolutely ham drum and bass remix of "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" as performed live by the two of them. Calling this a big deal would be an understatement; even just the live performance footage left an unmistakable mark on my views towards the two musicians. If this was some sort of teaser for something to come, I'm most definitely all for it.

This past week saw an official release of the trailer, but it certainly wasn't released quick enough to best heavy-handed theater-goers from recording their own copies of the trailer.

Within the release, Studio Khara also made mention of the maximum 10 years imprisonment for those who uploaded to sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

Over six years since the last entry in the ongoing tetralogy of films, it's long been reported that the upcoming movie would be the final entry into the Rebuild of Evangelion story. Previewed in theaters across Japan during pre-film advertisement segments, the 20-second clip can now be streamed via King Records' official YouTube channel. With a close focus on Mari and what appears to be an altered Eva unit, the teaser is a total flurry of action and movement that's just as enchanting after seeing it over and over. Set to release just in time for the 25th anniversary of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series, the fourth and final entry into the series supposedly sees director Hideaki Anno return with a new mindset after his work on the 2016 Shin Godzilla film.

Chasing right on the heels of the largely-successful Kantai Collection Arcade that launched in 2016, Fate/Grand Order Arcade utilizes the mobile game's gatcha system in conjunction with its fast-paced gameplay to keep players grinding for their favorite characters. Those familiar with Kantai Collection Arcade will likely feel right at home with this one, essentially utilizing the same arcade machines with some slightly different gameplay aspects. For those of you who aren't familiar, however, don't be expecting any turn-based battle systems like on the mobile game -- this is a fully-fledged 3D team battle title that'll lock you in from the start. While the game likely will require some basic Japanese knowledge to navigate, Type-Moon graciously put together a "How-to" video that'll give you the rundown on how to jump right into the action. Being a still-recovering Kantai Collection Arcade addict, it's definitely worth warning you that these games can get painfully addictive, as I'm sure a number of you know from the mobile version of the game. Unlike the mobile version of the game, not everything on this one is digital -- expect to be carrying around your Fate/Grand Order Arcade cards with you wherever you go should you get the urge to play. Speaking of the cards, they'll run you about 100 yen per print, a cost you'll feel add up over time for sure. Launched today within Japan, there's a number of tools available to find the closest arcade to you with a copy of the game.

Upon launch, the service will offer over 10,000 songs from a wide variety of anime series and will be priced at roughly $4.99 (USD) for both the iOS and Android version of the service. Along with the announcement, the service shared that all music will be available for premium users in 320kpbs, and will allow for up to 1,000 songs to be saved in a personal library. Upon launch, the streaming service will offer both free and premium account types, with the former allowing for song previews, lyric viewing, and small library creation. The news that the service will be launching in North America is most definitely welcomed, with access to such music being previously limited massively by various region restrictions and inaccessibility issues. While I'm not currently on the Japanese platform myself, I've heard rave reviews from friends who do use it, with most of them capable of playing the latest anime songs as soon as they become available. With the growing North American anime market, it'll be interesting to see what the adoption rate of yet another monthly subscription-based streaming service will be. Originally planned to launch in North America at the end of 2017, and having already launched in Japan during March 2017, the expansion into the North American market only further bridges international anime accessibility.

In particular, the main character - named Ren Amamiya in the currently airing anime adaptation - stands out as one of the coolest protagonists in a long time. It comes to no surprise then that a new clothing line inspired by the protagonist is seriously stylish. Japanese designer SuperGroupies have earned a name for themselves for their excellent anime-inspired apparel in the past, but I don’t think I’ve seen anything as slick as their newly announced Persona 5 line. As you can see from the picture, the pieces hardly even look like they are part of a crossover - they wouldn’t look out of place in the classiest hangouts of Ginza. The top and skirt are clearly inspired by Shujin Academy, yet hardly look like a school uniform. This is partly because of how stylish the uniform is anyway, but also largely due to the alterations SuperGroupies have made to the design. Also visible are the collaboration shoes and bag, which feature subtle motifs from the protagonist’s Phantom Thief outfit. There are also several other bags and pouches on offer, which look as handy as they do stylish. The final piece in the lineup moves away from stylish and more towards comfy - which definitely isn’t a bad move - with this fluffy hoodie that seems to take inspiration from the protagonist’s own fluffy hairstyle. There are also several pieces of jewelry on offer, which can be seen along with more information on the official website. Most of the collaboration pieces are intended for women, but Japanese fashion is always very unisex, so I’m sure you could make it work no matter your gender. After all, who doesn’t want to look as stylish as the protagonist?|Persona, Persona 5, SuperGroupies, Persona 5 Merch
13975|2018-07-25|13:00||http://otaquest.com/ashita-no-joe-retrospective/| News | Anime , Manga | 50 Years of Yabuki Joe, the Working Class Hero | Joe himself is what has kept the series so relevant and captivating even in the present day, spanning an incredible 50 years with many to come. |The year 1968 was a troubled time for Japan. Still barely recovering from the devastation of the Pacific War, most worked long hours for little pay, only to return home at the end of the day to starvation and squalor. Labor unions and student movements were in an uproar across the country, bringing necessary chaos to an already faltering economy. No wonder then was escapism so popular - and the most readily available form of this was comic books. Movies were great but required large budgets to match the blockbusters coming out of Hollywood at the time; whereas manga could be produced on the cheap and en masse. Surrounded by its peers Cyborg 009 and Star of the Giants, Chiba Tetsuya and Ikki Kajiwara’s Ashita no Joe which began serialization in Weekly Shonen Magazine quickly grew to become a phenomenon of popular culture from its debut in 1968. Contains spoilers for Ashita no Joe. Such was the popularity of the series that during the airing of the anime’s first season, fans actually carried out a real funeral for Joe’s rival Rikiishi Toru. This popularity would be cemented following Joe’s iconic death scene, which has become arguably one of the most iconic death scenes in Japanese media, referenced in anime as recent and eminent as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. But why was the series so popular? After all, from the outside it looks like a simple boxing series, following the same pattern of finding Joe’s opponent, identifying his weakness and then defeating him. To modern readers, this formula is even more apparent thanks to its implementation in the much longer and Joe-inspired Hajime no Ippo. But beneath this simplistic surface, a much more profound subtext touched the hearts of its contemporary audience. Whereas its forebears had dealt with fantastical worlds of magic and wonder - mostly inspired by series such as Astro Boy - Joe took a remarkably different path. It’s setting was Doya-machi, a slum inspired the real-life squalor of Sanya, which was a notorious slum in the Taito ward. Although this slum was the worst of the worse, the audience at the time wasn’t much better off - many of them were working class, didn’t have much to their name and therefore saw their own lives reflected in Joe, at least much more so than in the purely escapist manga that came before it. Furthermore, in stark contrast to other main characters of the time, Joe was not a paragon of virtue, but rather a deeply flawed human being. He was molded by his upbringing to become a violent, selfish thug - something he tried to be better than, but ultimately couldn’t escape. Much more so than the untouchable heroes popular at the time, Joe represented the worst of what we could be, but in the same vein our potential to become better people. This aspect of Joe himself is what has kept the series so relevant and captivating even in the present day. Obviously, slums such as Sanya are few and far between in Japan nowadays, and although many do suffer, it’d be hard to say that things haven’t improved. Yet, we as humans haven’t - we are still violent and selfish. Furthermore, the issue of toxic masculinity has come under much scrutiny in recent years due to many feeling constrained by gender, and in this sense Joe seems to be many years ahead of his time, as many of the reasons he acts selfishly and violent are due to his own sense of what it means to be a “man” - thus framing his own fate as a consequence of gender. So while Ashita no Joe turns 50, it's because of this artistic message that Yabuki Joe's power may continue to ring true even in the modern day. We’re even seeing new stories directly inspired by it, such as the recent Megalo Box. So while Joe isn’t the perfect hero - he is, and will always be, our hero.|Ashita no Joe, Tomorrow's Joe, MEGALOBOX, Yabuki Joe

The line has been doing very well, so Uniqlo has continued to add more designs each month to please eager fans. The latest addition to their line-up is several designs focused on arguably the most significant Jump properties, Naruto, One Piece, and Dragon Ball. The Naruto additions feature designs of Naruto as well as Sasuke, who has been rather overlooked in the line as of yet. I don’t like these designs as much as the others - with the white shirt featuring the Hidden Leaf Village insignia on the breast being my favorite - but I’m sure that any fans of the series will be looking to pick these shirts up as soon as possible. Another design features one of the first panels in the series, explaining the origin of the Nine-Tailed Fox, which is sure to make many fans very nostalgic. That sense of nostalgia also carries over to the new One Piece designs, as it features many panels from the Romance Dawn arc, including the execution of Gol D. Roger and Luffy’s initial proclamation that he will become the Pirate King. Just checking out the designs brings me back to the early 2000s, watching One Piece dubbed on Toonami. Perhaps less nostalgic and more harrowing is the design that features Portgas D. Ace’s iconic death scene and line “Thank you for loving me!”. I can’t help but think that wearing such a shirt in public might ruin the series for those who might want to get into it, but it’s certainly a moment with enough gravitas to proudly display it on your chest. By far the most numerous in this addition to the anniversary line are Dragon Ball designs, which isn’t surprising given the universal appeal of the series as well as the upcoming movie. The new additions feature a wide variety of designs from across the whole timeline of the series, from the initial page introducing Goku with his monkey tail to the final panel of the original manga. The latter is particularly excellent due it’s blue coloring and sentimental value. One final interesting addition to the 50th-anniversary collection are several designs featuring the first issues of Jump in which the aforementioned three powerhouse series appeared in. I’ve always been a fan of the aesthetic of Jump covers, so I definitely won’t have any qualms about picking these up. For more information on the Jump 50th anniversary Uniqlo line, please check out the official website. All of the shirts are pretty cheap, running anywhere around the $8 mark, as you’d expect from Uniqlo. It's worth noting too that worldwide stores are also stocking the collaborative collection, meaning you wont need to be flying over to Japan for this one.|Uniqlo, Weekly Shonen Jump, Uniqlo Jump, Dragon Ball, Uniqlo Dragon Ball, Shonen Jump, Uniqlo Shonen Jump

The music video comes fresh on the heels of the duo's latest EP, "SUMMER!", which released earlier this month via digital platforms.

Originally put on our radar earlier this year following the release of "Sweet Dreams", the former FIELD OF FOREST members Sera and Sho have consistently been releasing infectious tune after tune. Following up from their debut EP, "From Zero", the duo are back in full force with an incredible set of collaborators on the "SUMMER!" EP. We also wrote about their previous music video from the EP, "Night Sky", which was an equally infectious electronic rock jam in full Neko Hacker flavor. Whether it's for mega's charming vocals or Sithu Aye's incredible guitar solo mid-song, this one's definitely going to be getting some repeat.

While it had been in talks for years before production even began, it wouldn't be until 2017 that we finally had confirmation that the film was on its way. Over the past weekend during San Diego Comic-Con select attendees were given a fresh new look at what that time had wielded for the project, and now it's available online for the world to watch. Set to debut in theaters across North America on December 21, the upcoming Robert Rodriguez directed film adapts the story of Yukito Kishiro's original Battle Angel Alita manga series from the early-to-mid 90s. The film calls on both James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis who Rodriguez worked beside to pen the script for the film, which reportedly follows the core story from the original manga. The upcoming live-action film is described below: When Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past – she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control. If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she’s grown to love. Reception of the latest trailer has been largely positive, so it'll be interesting to see how the latest Hollywood adaptation of an original manga property goes down critically. Until then, however, further information on the upcoming film can be found via Alita: Battle Robot's official website.|Alita: Battle Angel, Alita, Battle Angel, James Cameron, GUNNM, Battle Angel Alita

Following that announcement, we also got to see some of the English-language dub in action, highlighted with an all-new PV below: The PV mostly features a voiceover from Justin Briner as Deku, but we get to here the great Christopher Sabat as All Might at the end with the teasing line “Soon!” - and I must say he’s sounding excellent as usual. Other than that, the PV is the same as the original Japanese version, but far more exciting was the news that Funimation will be bringing the movie to North American theaters this fall both dubbed and subbed. This will mean a relatively short period between the Japanese and North American release, mitigating somewhat the risk of encountering spoilers (although this movie most likely won’t advance the plot of the series in any way) and not making fans wait as is common with other Japanese movies such as your name. Furthermore, Funimation’s decision to release the film in both dubbed and subbed should please all sides of the community and help the film be the success it can definitely be. In any case, we can’t wait to see the new My Hero Academia movie here in Japan, and it’s great that Western fans will get the chance to see it in theaters as well -- relatively soon at that.

Adding to that excitement, the account additionally gave us a sneak peek of a somewhat new Evangelion unit. 【シンエヴァ特報スタッフ】 CGIアニメーションディレクター：松井祐亮 CGIテクニカルディレクター：鈴木貴志 CGIモデリングディレクター：小林学 CGIアニメーション：岩里昌則 仲眞良一 リギング：髙部翼 ※画像：8号機特報検討用モデル※ pic.twitter.com/3tmTA3Pvaz — (株)カラー 2号機 (@khara_inc2) 20 July 2018 Head staff for the CGI unit of the film have been confirmed above, with many long-time Khara collaborators returning for the supposed last hurrah. Particularly noteworthy is Yusuke Matsui’s return from Evangelion 3.0 to take up the position of CG Animation Director on this new project, which will hopefully ensure that the same high level of animation present in 3.0 will be carried over to this movie. Below them will most likely be the applicants to the recruitment call from a few months ago, which focused mainly on 3DCG and VFX work. With the release date only being two years away and no more casting calls being put out on the Khara website, it’d be safe to assume that production is now fully filled with all of the members it needs to begin in earnest. It’s strange to think that the film is also probably already written, given the secrecy surrounding the project. After all, we could be in for another complete reversal of expectations in the same vein as Evangelion 3.0, although I doubt that will happen. Also attached to the tweet is what looks to be some concept art of the new version of Mari’s Unit 08 that was glimpsed in the preview at the end of Evangelion 3.0 and in the latest teaser that aired in Japanese theaters. It certainly seems like Khara are letting their imagination run wild once more with this design, given its freakishly long arms and unique gun placement. Not much more information can be gleaned - as expected of the cryptic Evangelion franchise - but it’s still reassuring to see any movement forward in production on the new movie given how long it has been since the release of the last entry. Here’s hoping that production proceeds smoothly so that we can see the conclusion of this tetralogy sooner rather than later. |Evangelion, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Shin Evangelion, Evangelion 3.0+1.0, Studio Khara, Gainax

Funimation had previously confirmed that it had plans to put the movie in North American theatres, but it was revealed once the dubbed trailer dropped during San Diego Comic-Con that the upcoming Dragon Ball Super: Broly would also premiere dubbed, without the inclusion of subtitles. The latest #DragonBallSuper movie: #Broly comes to theaters in North America in January 2019 dubbed! Stay tuned for future updates of the movie about the strongest Saiyans. pic.twitter.com/26IszV5xof — Funimation (@FUNimation) 21 July 2018 To be honest, this isn’t very surprising given the affinity Dragon Ball has for it’s English dub. Whereas a percentage of anime fans would raise an eyebrow to the prospect of watching something dubbed as opposed to subbed, when it comes to Dragon Ball many would struggle to get along with Masako Nozawa instead of Sean Schemmel as Goku, or Ryusei Nakao instead of Christopher Ayres as Frieza. This is partly due to the nostalgia stemming from the series airing on Toonami, but can also be chalked up to the passion and dedication that the Funimation cast have for the series - with Christopher Sabat being a prime example of that. While many fans won’t be bothered by the English dub, I can’t help but feel it’s a bit of a shame that Funimation possibly isn’t prepared to offer fans who would like to see the original, equally stellar Japanese cast at work an opportunity to do so in theatres. Judging from the tweet, it’s likely that “in the future” we’ll be able to watch the subbed version, probably when the movie releases on Bluray and DVD -- but it’s such a shame to think that Funimation might not even be considering a subbed version for theatrical release. Reading the replies to the tweets also reveals that many would’ve liked the option of both a dubbed and subbed version, which does seem contrary to the love many fans have for the dub. Once you consider that Dragon Ball Super released subbed on Crunchyroll for a while before Funimation began producing their dub, however, it’s not hard to see why many Western fans have come to love the Japanese cast equally, despite the prevalence of the dub in the community. Furthermore, many fans have pointed out that the upcoming My Hero Academia movie will be getting screenings in both Japanese and English, which proves that such a thing isn’t exactly impossible for Funimation. So while it’s great that Funimation is bringing the movie to theaters, their potential decision to only show it dubbed in English has brought them a pretty large amount of flack from the community. Here's hoping that Funimation can take the feedback from fans into account so that the film can be the success we all want it to be.|Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball Super: Broly, Funimation, Dragon Ball movie

They live unremarkable lives, until the day a Mecha falls out of the sky, along with a strange woman named “Haruko.” Her plans for Kana and her friends involve the force known as “ATOMSK.” Kana will have to risk everything to decide whether or not to help... like she really has a choice!"

We sat down to talk to her about her journey from way back when to now. |It’s no small secret that within the anime industry right now, there’s no name more prominent than that of scriptwriter-gone-director Mari Okada. She’s been the driving force behind some of the biggest animated titles in recent memory, from “Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day” to her most recent Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, Ms. Okada really is showing no sign of slowing down. Recent times have seen a particular spotlight on the creative, only further fueled by the English-language release of her heart-wrenching autobiography From Truant to Anime Screenwriter: My Path to “Anohana” and “The Anthem of the Heart”. During this year's Anime Expo event, we were given the incredible opportunity to sit down and have a one-on-one discussion with Mari Okada ahead of Eleven Arts’ nationwide theatrical release of Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms in North America. Our full interview can be read below: OQ: It’s well documented throughout your incredible autobiography “From Truant to Anime Screenwriter: My Path to anohana and The Anthem of the Heart” that your life before joining the anime industry was anything but easy-going. Now being regarded as one of the greatest anime screenwriters of all time, how does it feel to know that you carved this path yourself? MO: This time around when writing my autobiography, I looked at a lot of my old journals to take a look at what my thoughts were during that time. It was kind of startling to see all the old thoughts that I had at the time, though at the same time felt like there was a lot I could learn from my old self. I think at the time I thought of myself as “shit” in a word, even going as far as wanting to disappear, but looking back now I feel that I have a lot of respect for that person. So even the young people now who are struggling, if they look back on their lives I think they’ll see a lot that will help them understand themselves. OQ: Jumping back to something you mentioned there, you said you would often look back at your old journals and read over everything you wrote in them. Writing seems to have always been a big part of your life; from a way to convey emotions to a way to express desires. My next questions leads into that a little bit -- It’s not often that a creative comes forward with such a troubling yet powerful life story and is capable of applying both themes from their past - and themes absent - to their works. Can you share how your upbringing affects the stories you create, especially looking at your most recent works such as Maquia - When the Promised Flower Blooms? MO: In my autobiography I wrote that when I was staying home during my high school years, there wasn’t any way to communicate with the outside world. I was completely indoors. Since the internet and that kind of technology didn’t exist there was no way to communicate with the outside world. In that situation my imagination really blew up, leaving me to fantasize about everything and anything. That really came in handy in writing stories like Anohana, something that draws inspiration from my own life so heavily. Though, I have a special place for other stories that are based on things I haven’t experience myself too. OQ: While straying away from school life, it’s noted that you had one teacher in particular who would work with you to submit your works for local newspaper prizes due to your skilled writing abilities. During that time, was the idea of joining the anime industry ever something that crossed your mind? MO: At the time I didn’t want to write scripts for animation, actually. First of all, I wasn’t even sure I would be able to graduate from school. I was worried daily, and I think what I was writing was very dark at that time too. OQ: That’s interesting. So you didn’t want to be in the anime industry at that time, was there anything else you had as a goal before you ended up becoming a scriptwriter? MO: I didn’t really have a goal. So when I read through my old journals and saw that I had no goal, I realized that I really must have looked down on myself. I didn’t like myself during those times. I’m not really sure if it’s this way in foreign countries too, but in Japan, if you don’t have a clear goal or a big dream you’re seen by society as being “no good”, essentially a failure. That was kind of how I viewed myself at the time of writing in my journal. Interestingly, not knowing then and just kind of putting the feelers out there to absorb things, a lot of those materials would end up shaping the person who I am today. OQ: You mention that you didn’t really have anything that you wanted to do. But even now, outside of your work as a scriptwriter and a director, it’s clear that you do so much more. You write novels, are dabbling in manga creation -- you do so much outside of the realm of anime that it’s truly impressive. When looking at your work in novel writing and manga creation, are these fields you would ever wish to pursue at a professional level, especially with where you are now as a person? MO: When I was young there was no movement in my life -- I could see that everyone else was moving around me but, yet I remained stationary. I didn’t know how to interface with that moving world outside. When I finally left the safety of my home, I really wanted to move. I found myself wanting more because when I wasn’t moving it was like I was imagining all of these things that people must be experiencing. Once I actually got out into the world, however, there wasn’t as much as I thought there would be though. Because of this I kind of started to do more things on my own. It’s a weird way of saying it, but I kind of wanted to bring back that time. I really consider anime to be my savior, and being an anime writer feels great, its what continues to feel best. Because of that I think I’ll continue on this path. -- Break -- OQ: Sorry, I’m getting a little emotional. I was really touched when reading your autobiography, so vocally discussing the subjects is a lot of feelings pouring out. MO: Honestly I’m really impressed here [Referring to Anime Expo]. Seeing so many people expressing what they like at a young age, talking about their favorite things, making friends. That was something I couldn’t do when I was younger, so I think that’s really cool. OQ: I think that within the anime community in the West, the story of not knowing what you’re doing can often resonate quite strongly. So having someone who made it through those unknown times, seeing someone doing what they truly love can be especially inspiring. Winding it back a little, this question has to do with the anime industry as a whole. As one of the most promising female talents in the entire anime industry, scratch that, one of the most promising anime talents period, I want to ask you about being a female in what is still such a male dominated industry? MO: Over at PA Works there are actually more female animators than men, I actually get this question a lot when going overseas. Right now I actually feel like there are a lot more women doing this work, at least around me. When I joined there weren’t a lot of women, something that came with a fair share of challenges for sure. OQ: What do you believe sparked the change? MO: People who love anime started speaking out, that was a big part of it. When I was young if I said I liked anime, people would say “Oh really? You like anime?”. I wasn’t going to school, so that was another additional factor, but when I did I couldn’t share my interest with anyone so I enjoyed everything alone. Probably the biggest part of it now is that people are now confidently able to say “I love anime” without any hesitation. OQ: I think that’s a trend that’s also changing over in the West as well. For example at this convention [Anime Expo] there are over 100,000 attendees. Even just a few years ago you wouldn’t see even half of that number in attendance. More people are speaking up about what they really enjoy, regardless of gender, and I feel like that also ties into why you hear that question often from foreign outlets. Moving onto the next question, with this one being more about your work on Maquia. Your work on Maquia - When the Promised Flower Blooms would prove to be your first time helming the directorial role of an animated film; did you find the creative freedom enabled you to tell a more specifically Mari Okada story than previous works such as Anohana and The Anthem of the Heart? Did you prefer being in control over the project entirely instead of working under another director? MO: To begin with, the process of scriptwriting involves getting notes, and going back & forth with people. It’s a group activity, and you really have to listen to other people’s opinions. In this situation, the producer said “Write what you really want to write, you can do whatever you want”. With those words I quickly became my own worst critic. So there were things I would end up hesitating or struggling with and have to work through them. Writers work alone at home, and I thought I liked that solitary aspect and didn’t like interacting. I had a mindset that I needed to protect myself, and that I would get exhausted if I interacted with lots of people. But being a director, I was in a situation where I had to be with people all day long, every single day; the first year was really tough. Little by little it became really enjoyable, however. I became very close with all of the staff involved. It got to the point where we would have arguments about the story every day, it kind of felt like me hitting puberty again and becoming an adult or something *laughs*. OQ: So looking back at those moments from the first year of production and everything after, was there any particular point in time that really stood out? MO: Toward the end there was a point where no one was sleeping much because it was so close to the deadline. There was a christmas party, or some sort of party, where we ordered some cheap pizza and we were underground at this place having a really fun time together. That really left a mark on me. I remember one of the production members yelling like he was a comedian on TV and jumping up & down. It was a really tense production environment but thanks to the break the work that we continued afterwards went really well. I realized that things like that can really benefit the end product. OQ: I believe that’s all we have time for today, but it was an absolute honor sitting down and taking with you Ms. Okada. MO: Thank you for your time. With an incredible legacy and journey to her name, Mari Okada deserves every piece of recognition she’s received in recent times.

13948|2018-07-20|13:30||http://otaquest.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-trailer/| News | Anime | ‘Dragon Ball Super’ Movie Reveals Broly in New Trailer | The trailer reveals the sheer power of the antagonist Broly, one of the Legendary Super Saiyans that appear every one thousand years, as he absolutely destroys Super Saiyan Vegeta, Final Form Frieza, and Super Saiyan Blue Goku. |Ever since Dragon Ball Super came to end an end earlier this year with the explosive climax of the Tournament of Power, fans have been eagerly awaiting news on the upcoming movie, which is set to release this December. Only sweetening the excitement of the film is that fact that original series author Akira Toriyama will be tackling the story, meaning this is definitely going to be something grand. Except for a key visual and short teaser featuring Goku, however, information has been scarce. That all changed today though, with Toei finally dropping a new trailer for the movie - and it looks absolutely incredible. The trailer reveals the sheer power of the antagonist Broly, one of the Legendary Super Saiyans that appear every one thousand years, as he absolutely destroys Super Saiyan Vegeta, Final Form Frieza, and Super Saiyan Blue Goku. It’s clear that, in order to defeat Broly, Goku will need to find a new power - possibly something to do with his Great Ape form that debuted in the first arc of the series, as suggested by an after-title sting of someone with a monkey tail. It doesn’t look like Goku but certainly seems to suggest that the Great Ape powers will be a part of the story in some shape or form. Broly already appeared in several Dragon Ball Z movies, but Toriyama already explained that this version of Broly will be slightly different, as he was first conceived as an original character by someone other than Toriyama. That being said, it looks like he will maintain the same basic concept, that of being the strongest Saiyan, so fans of Broly shouldn’t worry too much. Furthermore, his father Paragas can also be seen in the trailer, this time sporting white hair and beard, further suggesting that this version of Broly won’t be that different from his original conception. Another thing on showcase here is the incredible animation. Dragon Ball Super garnered attention in its later arcs for its incredible fight animation despite a rocky start, and it seems like the talented team of animators working on the project are being given the chance to flex their creative muscles once more. Particular excellent are the character designs and line art, giving expression and flavor to each silhouette. I have no doubt that the power of Broly will be done justice by this talented team, and I can’t wait to see it. The movie will release December 14 in Japan and has been confirmed for a theatrical release in the US soon after. Akira Toriyama’s series is now over 30 years old but doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.|Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball Super Broly, Broly
13947|2018-07-20|13:20||http://otaquest.com/metal-gear-movie-tease-timeline/| News | Games | ‘Metal Gear’ Movie Director Teases Approach to Timeline and Canon | If there’s one word that couldn’t be used to describe Hideo Kojima’s beloved franchise Metal Gear, it’d have to be simple. |If there’s one word that couldn’t be used to describe Hideo Kojima’s beloved franchise Metal Gear, it’d have to be simple. After all, the events of the series span hundred of years during very different time periods, from the Cold War to the distant future. So when it was announced that Jordan Vogt-Roberts (Kong: Skull Island, Kings of Summer) would be tackling a movie adaptation of the series, how the adaptation would approach this dense history and at which point it would start was naturally among the biggest questions raised by fans. But now we have something of an answer. To celebrate 31 years since the release of the original Metal Gear for MSX, Vogt-Roberts launched the ‘#METALGEAR31st’ project on July 13, which will see a new piece of artwork created in collaboration with “next-gen” artists posted every day to celebrate the series’ legacy. We already speculated that something more profound may be lying under the surface of this seemingly simple concept, and we now have our first taste of just that. DAY 4 of #METALGEAR31st Dennis Chan was one of my art assassins on KONG. MGS is about the “cycle of pain” so we created a diptych to visually represent history repeating. Can’t wait for you to see my approach to the dense past & present timeline of this world. Zoom in. Enjoy pic.twitter.com/Ni0U9IICwh — Jordan Vogt-Roberts (@VogtRoberts) 16 July 2018 It all started with the above artwork, posted on the fourth day of the celebration. It features Big Boss and Gray Fox both taking on mechs, but more interesting than the artwork itself are Vogt-Roberts’ comments. Firstly, the director stated that the Metal Gear series is about the “cycle of pain,” in that history and tragedy repeat itself during the events of the franchise. This is certainly an element of the franchise, with the story of Big Boss and Solid Snake being alternate versions of each other, with each character going in different directions while dealing with the same conflicts. Yet there are many other themes that are also present in the franchise, the most important of which I always deemed to be anti-war and anti-exploitation, but the fact that Vogt-Roberts named history repeating as “the” message of Metal Gear possibly suggests that his story will emphasize that above all else. That being said, it would be difficult to present this theme of history repeating without actually seeing the different histories. Obviously, in the games this is achieved since you play them out of chronological order, seeing both Solid Snake and Big Boss develop at the same time even though they live decades apart. Vogt-Roberts commented on this, saying that he is eager to show you his own “approach” to the history of the series. The fact that Vogt-Robert uses “my” here seems to suggest that he will be venturing away from the source material and towards his own way of telling the stories of Solid Snake and Big Boss. What exactly that approach will be is still unclear, but my guess would be that he may attempt to combine the story of both Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 3: Peace Walker - the origins of both Solid Snake and Big Boss - to convey his chosen theme of history repeating. It was always previously thought that the movie project would be an adaptation of Metal Gear Solid, but now it seems probable that the project will be diverging slightly to include elements from later in the games, from Big Boss’ story. I have no doubt that Vogt-Roberts will continue to drop hints like this, so be sure to keep an eye on his ongoing series of tweets.|Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Movie, Hideo Kojima
13946|2018-07-20|13:10|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/lupin-the-third-beer-sake/| News | Anime | Grab a Beer or Sip Some Sake with the ‘Lupin the Third’ Crew | One of my greatest adult pleasures has to be grabbing a drink and watching some Lupin the Third, so it’s always great when these two worlds collide. |One of life's greatest adult pleasures has to be grabbing a drink and watching some of your favorite anime; so it’s always great when these two worlds collide. There's a short list of anime series that could pull off such a collision, but there's perhaps none more fitting for an alcoholic crossover than that of Lupin the Third, a series that has always enjoyed an affinity for the finer things in life. Sankt Gallen Brewery is one of the most iconic Japanese craft beer breweries, so it’s definitely a testament to the cultural significance of the Lupin series that they have decided to entrust five of their iconic beers to the Lupin crew by changing the labels of each beer during the period of the crossover to feature one of the five key characters. Furthermore, special crossover glasses will be available for purchase, which honestly wouldn’t look out of place in the fanciest bars in Ginza. But it’s not like they’ve just slapped the likeness of the Lupin crew onto the beers - each one of the beers matches the character in some way. Lupin will be on the brewery’s IPA, as it is one of the most famous beers - just like Lupin himself is the most iconic character of the series. Goemon will be on the Amber Ale, as it packs a punch behind it’s hoppy and flowery aroma, just like Goemon quietly hides his own strength behind his calm demeanor. Fujiko will be on the Orange Ale, which pairs her own flirtatious personality with the beer’s own juicy and fruity flavor. Zenigata will be on the Golden Ale, the brewery’s most easy-drinking beer, in accordance with his own straight-laced personality as a man of the law. Finally, Jigen will be on the brewery’s porter - rich and mellow in flavor, and black just like Jigen’s own sense of fashion. In addition, the crew will be making an appearance on Miyoshi Distillery’s sake, which has been consumed nationwide since the business’ inception in 1903. I don’t think anyone other than Goemon drinks sake in the series, but since this is Japan, it’d be a shame not to see the crew appear on the nation’s iconic alcoholic beverage. The same five characters will be appearing on the containers of the five different strength sake brews that the distillery has to offer, the lowest starting at 40% with Fujiko, and ending at 80% with Zenigata. While it’s a shame that there are no glasses on offer for the sake, the designs look pretty nice with the clear liquid. All of the glasses and alcohol are scheduled for release at the end of July, so if you’re interested in grabbing a drink with the Lupin crew - perhaps while watching the currently airing Lupin the Third: Part V - then definitely check out the official website for more details, here. I’m sure that Lupin would make a great drinking partner, although I do worry if I would be able to keep up with him.|Lupin the Third, Lupin, Lupin beer, Lupin III, Lupin Sake

With a particular focus on Mari, who was riding in a new pink and orange Eva unit, the trailer concluded with news of a 2020 release timeframe for the upcoming film. Set to be released over eight years since the release of Evangelion 3.0 in Japan, Shin Evangelion Theatrical Version:|| will fall both around the Olympics, as well as on the series' 25th anniversary. Reported to be the final entry in Studio Khara's ongoing Rebuild of Evangelion films, the Hideaki Anno directed feature has long been teased as something that would never actually come to fruition, making the news especially exciting. While there's currently no news of the trailer releasing outside of theatrical previews, this certainly does provide a good reason to arrive a little early for the next film you'll be seeing. Viewable as of July 20 in theaters, we'll be checking this one out sooner rather than later. Given the events of Evangelion 3.0, it's particularly difficult to predict just what Anno has up his sleeves for Shin Evangelion Theatrical Version:|| when it finally does release. Though we've still got about two years before we can finally see it for ourselves, I'll be remaining cautiously optimistic, and hope the film can be delivered by that 2020 deadline.

Set to launch in spring 2019, VIZ Media detailed that they will be releasing the manga in 2-in-1 omnibus editions, with the romantic comedy manga to feature a set of new translations. The news couldn't come at a better time, either, with the manga celebrating its 40th anniversary since originally being published in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1978. Announcement: Urusei Yatsura (2-in-1 Edition), the classic romantic comedy manga series by Rumiko Takahashi, returns spring 2019. pic.twitter.com/UWvsPQ2z5b — VIZ @ SDCC 2018 (@VIZMedia) 19 July 2018 VIZ Media described the series: Revisit the acclaimed romantic comedy about an unlucky human boy who meets a beautiful space alien princess in this large trim size edition with all-new translations and new cover designs. In the series, Ataru Moroboshi's supernatural encounters with the feminine kind all start when he's chosen to play tag with an alien princess named Lum who invades the earth on her UFO. Ataru has ten days to touch Lum's horns or aliens will take over the earth! As it turns out, the game of tag is only the beginning of Ataru's troubles, as he continues to attract strange encounters with otherworldly beings like beautiful snow spirit Oyuki and the sexy crow goblin Princess Kurama! While it would be fair enough to say that Rumiko Takahashi's Urusei Yatsura never really left the hearts of both older and younger generations in Japan, there's most certainly been small resurgences of interest amongst Western communities. Whether its fresh faces stumbling upon the 1981 anime series, people simply appreciating the incredible Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer animated film, or even pockets of the internet music community enjoying the aesthetic of characters like Lum, interest is most definitely there. Originally receiving a North American release via VIZ Media back in the '90s under the names "Lum" and later "The Return of Lum", the publication of the series was unfortunately short-lived, never realizing the full length of the manga. It'd appear this time, however, VIZ Media are all-in, so this really will be a great entry point to check out the entire manga as its being published once more.

13939|2018-07-20|04:30|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/kotaku-sailor-moon-america/| News | Anime | Kotaku Uncovers Surprising Details About Sailor Moon's History In America | The original American pilot for Sailor Moon, often called "Saban Moon", is something of a fever dream. Now through some serious investigative journalism, Kotaku reveals the truth is even stranger than any of us knew. |The complete story of Sailor Moon in North America is something that sounds a fever dream when you first hear it. From licensing & toy sales motivation, to a Power Rangers style project being developed to make the series more palatable for a US audience, to wacky rights deals, Sailor Moon's current popularity in the US is nothing shy of a miracle. And it seems it's also definitely very confusing to some of the people who were involved at the very beginning as revealed by Kotaku in an amazing piece of investigative journalism by writer Cecelia D'Anastasio posted this morning. For those of you who haven't heard of it already, Sailor Moon almost came to the US as a very different product. The initial concept was shown off at Anime Expo in 1995 by means of a short music video made up from a 17 minute pilot created by a studio called Toon Makers. Often referred to as "Saban Moon" (due to the incorrect belief that Saban Entertainment produced the clip), the story of this pilot is something of a mystery and that it has never been uncovered in over 20 years makes it something that die hard fans are still searching for this day. As you can see in the video above, which was recorded directly from the only time it's known to have been show publicly, the original concept was a mix of live action and animation that took very loose inspiration from the original Japanese source material. In the years since it was shown the original script has been uncovered, as have animation cels from the pilot. Fans have been rabidly looking for more information for years with dead ends popping up left and right, until today. In the Kotaku piece, Cecelia had the opportunity to speak with some of the team who worked on the original project and gets a lot more information about what actually went down with this piece of lost media. By the end some really surprising information about it is uncovered as well the discovery of a previously unknown teaser for a concept called "Team Angel", a live action pitch that was clearly inspired by the Sailor Moon property and supported by Bandai. It's a seriously fascinating read if you're a fan of North American anime history or Sailor Moon, and the twist ending makes the topic that much more interesting. For me personally, seeing this pop up is like another piece in a puzzle that I have also been trying to put together for years. I myself own several animation cels from the original pilot shown above, and have actually tracked down and befriended the person who owns most of (if not all) the rest that haven't been publicly circulated yet. I remain pretty confident that one day the original 17 minute pilot will be uncovered, especially when you consider the recent leak of the 1997 Spaceworld Pokemon Gold demo along with all of the other insane pieces of lost media that have been found in recent years. In the meantime, I highly recommend you check out the entire piece over at Kotaku.|Sailor Moon, Kotaku, Saban, Toon Makers, America, Pilot, Team Angel

Earlier this week marked the release of the trackmaker's latest digital single, "Warp Star", which began streaming via the artist's official YouTube as well as most major other platforms. Acting as a bubbly throwback to some of Snail's House's earliest works, "Warp Star" is a cozy summer day tune that's equal parts enjoyable and easy to get lost in. It's no secret that Snail's House is easily one of the hardest working producers right now, pushing out incredible work after work without falter -- part of the reason it's no surprise that "Warp Star" is such a great single. While the future bass market has long felt both stagnated and congested, it's nice to see a real pioneer of the sound revisit the genre bringing with them everything they now know. Oh, and the Soruto illustrated artwork couldn't be any more perfect for the vibes of the song either.

Today we finally received our first piece of information on the second entry into the trilogy of films, titled ANEMONE/Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution, the upcoming film is set to premiere across Japan on November 10, 2018. Joining the slew of announcements today was an all-new 30-second teaser, which can be streamed below: As the title of the film quite clearly suggests, the second entry into the Hi-Evolution trilogy of films will closely revolve around the pink-haired Anemone. Throughout the teaser, we're presented with a frantic image of chaos, the midst of a battle where mankind is caught up in the middle of it all. Centered in all of that is Anemone, closing out with a powerful zoom-in shot of the character. It feels like every piece of teaser leading up to this film is an intense departure from what many might have seen the Eureka Seven franchise as before, even down to the recently-revealed ley visual: Regardless, there's a whole lot to look forward to with these times ahead, and I can't wait to check out ANEMONE / Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution when it is finally released. Slated to open in 107 theaters across Japan, the second film will again be directed by Tomoki Kyouda and will feature scriptwriting by Dai Sato, as well as character designs from Kenichi Yoshida. With just a few short months until the film official releases across Japan, further information can be found via ANEMONE/Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution's official website.|ANEMONE / Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution, ANEMONE, Eureka Seven, Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution, Hi-Evolution 2, Studio Bones, Dai Sato

Three years after the game originally launched, when the anime series began airing, I again found myself unable to get overly interested in the series; but maybe that's all about to change. During an interview with Japanese gaming website Gematsu, Cygames announced that their upcoming collaborative PlayStation 4 RPG title with Platinum Games, Granblue Fantasy Project Re:LINK, will be localized in English. While in-depth gameplay elements aren't exactly the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about the current Granblue Fantasy game on smartphone devices, every bit of footage revealed for the upcoming title defies everything I've come to expect. From visuals to combat and everything in-between, there really does seem to be a whole lot to look forward to with the upcoming title. Combining the pre-existing lore of Cygames' Granblue Fantasy with the development prowess of Platinum Games, and well, chances are we're in for something great. Though it was shared during the interview that the game would be localized in English-language, Cygames reiterated that they are still yet to announce where, or when, the game will be released. Until that information is announced, however, we're going to have to remain cautiously optimistic and look forward to the next time we're actually able to look at the game.

13927|2018-07-18|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/azur-lane-english-trailer/| News | Anime , Games | Upcoming 'Azur Lane' English Release Receives First Trailer | While Azur Lane continues to grow here in Japan, the naval smartphone game has already set its eyes on English-speaking audiences, with the first trailer launching today. |Chances are that if you're reading this website, you're already familiar with the smash-hit mobile game Azur Lane that took Japan by storm over the past year. The naval warfare title seemingly came out of nowhere in a field already dominated by other games such as Kantai Collection. Learning from their downfalls and using them as the game's greatest strengths, the Chinese-developed smartphone game developed a dedicated audience ready worldwide who have remained consistently ready for more. Released today via the official YouTube channel for Azur Lane, we were finally given our first look at the game's upcoming English-language release via an all-new trailer. Launched alongside the trailer were some big updates to Azur Lane's English website, additionally offering us an insight as to the game's worldview. Those who make their way over to the website will note that pre-registration for the game has launched, with a current release timeframe of later this year. This is a blue planet, 71% of its surface is covered with water. Humans beings were born in this azure blue sea at the very beginning. However, as humanity grew, so did their ever-expanding ambitions. Peaceful times gave way to war and devastation. Finally, a mysterious enemy emerged from the sea. In the face of overwhelming hostile forces, all camps were still fighting each other. The final result was tragic: Humanity lost more than 90% of its control over the sea. People struggled to survive. The fear of the unknown enemy, who drag humanity into the dark abyss of the despair, spread everywhere. Decades later, in order to recapture the once glorious past, the major camps finally decided to unite and created the Azur Lane – a worldwide military organization. The purpose of the Azur Lane is to gather technologies and resources, and share them between all major camps in the world, to fight back the mysterious enemy. Now, everyone has the same goal: to construct a new fleet that can compete with the “Sirens” and regain control of the sea. The release of Azur Lane in English-speaking territories comes after titles such as Fate/Grand Order have continued to find much success in the West. While direct competitors such as Kantai Collection had played it safe in the past, neglecting the opportunity to release their title on smartphone devices or in English-speaking territories, it would appear that Azur Lane continues to use these pitfalls as their greatest selling point. With pre-registration open now, you can find further information on the upcoming iOS and Android release of Azur Lane via the game's official website.

It still feels weird to say, but chances are that'll be the last time you'll see both Nono and Kinoko together in a music video; especially following the departure of Kinoko from the group just a few weeks ago. With that being said, there's no need to fear -- it seems group activities will be resuming as usual, just with three new faces along for the ride. Shared today via Happy Kuru Kuru's official SNS accounts, we've gotten our first look at the new group members which includes three new faces. From left to right in the above image, we see Tsukino, Nono, Linoa, and Naruno, with members sporting the colors blue, pink, purple, and orange. While we're still yet to hear any new music since the group underwent its member changes, it has been shared that Happy Kuru Kuru will be performing a number of shows over the coming weeks that will likely give fans a tease of what's to come.

Set to release in Japan during the Winter of 2018, it's been detailed that the game will connect the worlds of the original game protagonist, Keita, as well as that of the protagonist of Yo-kai Watch Shadowside: Oni-o no Fukkatsu's film protagonist Natsume, and finally the upcoming Yo-kai Watch: Forever Friends' Shin. Revealed alongside the new timeframe for Yo-Kai Watch was our first in-game screenshot for the upcoming title, and it's looking absolutely gorgeous. Transitioning from a console like the Nintendo 3DS to the Switch was always going to wield some seriously impressive results, though it'd be dishonest to say I'm still not blown away. Leaving us with the simple yet efficient teaser of in-game imagery, there's still a whole lot we don't know about the upcoming game. With that being said, however, it doesn't seem like we'll be waiting too much longer to find out either.

Unfortunately for you then, some sick, cruel person at Takeshobo, the publisher of Pop Team Epic's 4-coma manga series, decided it'd be a good idea to pair the two up. Teased via Takeshobo's official website, the worlds of Pop Team Epic and Sanrio are set to collide for a limited-run of Comiket 94 goods. Whether its Little Twin Stars, My Melody, Pompompurin, or even Hangyodon, it appears nothing is sacred when it comes to Pop Team Epic. The unlikely collaboration sees itself spread out across four different variants of t-shirts, as well as a tote bag. Captioning the announcement image is a special "We're sorry, Sanrio." message as well as the subtitle "A collaboration between some seriously popular characters and some not so popular characters!". Those hoping to get their hands on some of the merchandise will need to make their way over to Takeshobo's booth at Comiket 94 next month, which will be taking place at Tokyo Big Site from August 10 - 12.

13908|2018-07-16|16:00||http://otaquest.com/07th-expansion-umineko/| News | Games | 07th Expansion To Launch New Game, ‘Umineko’ Collection This Winter | Ryukishi 07 took to the stage recently to announce that Higurashi's successor title 'Umineko' would be receiving a complete collection later this year, while announcing a new title for the series. |If you’re not already acquainted with Ryukishi 07’s mind-bending doujinshi horror/mystery series When They Cry, then you’re doing yourself a disservice. Ever since the release of Higurashi in 2002, the series has constantly enraptured and succeeded in telling some of the best stories of modern Japanese fiction. With that in mind, it’s really exciting to finally see some news about the future of the series. Sunday saw a double whammy of announcements with Ryukishi attending a convention in Finland. Firstly, it was announced that Umineko, the successor to Higurashi, would be getting a new release entitled “Umineko no Naku Koro ni: Saku.” The new release will combine all previous episodes of Umineko into one package, including episodes one through eight, Tsubasa and Hane along with a “new episode” - getting fans of the series seriously excited. 今冬、2作品同時発表予定…ッ！！ ■07th Expansion 完全新作「●●のなく頃に(仮)」 ■原作ソフトオールインパック＋新シナリオ１本＋α 「うみねこのなく頃に 咲(さく)」 原画・シナリオ 竜騎士07 メインスクリプター ナカオボウシ @tempo_kouhou メイングラフィック れもたろ @remotaro pic.twitter.com/3Uu6dv2RB7 — 07thExpansion (@07th_official) 14 July 2018 07th Expansion stated that this new release will be like the recently released Higurashi no Naku Koro ni: Hou, which also combined all episodes of Higurashi as well as a new one into one complete package. Hou was generally well received by fans, as it brought all of the otherwise disparate releases together into one package. It was also released on Nintendo Switch, and we all know that playing visual novels in bed is one of the greatest pleasures in this life. That being said, we don’t yet have full confirmation as to what platform the game will release on, or even what studio is tackling the release, so it’s best not to make too many assumptions. Never content, however, 07th Expansion also took the opportunity to share some new information regarding the upcoming ‘fifth’ installment in the When They Cry franchise, following up on the release of Umineko episodes four through eight. Tentatively titled “●● no Naku Koro ni,” it is scheduled to release this winter alongside Saku. Ryukishi will be heading the game’s development, but much like with Rose Gun Days, another artist called Remotaro will be tackling the art. As much as I enjoy Ryukishi’s unique art style, it's a pretty commonly known fact that he never had much experience in drawing, so it’s no surprise that he would take the opportunity to lessen the load on himself this time around. Even so, the character pictured alongside Battler in the announcement does seem to be drawn in Ryukishi’s style, so we don’t yet know what effect the change in artist will have on the franchise. That character, by the way, is the main character of the new When They Cry. They look quite a lot like Rosa from Umineko, and although I would assume that they are female, Ryukishi has been to known to play with gender image in the past, so it’s best to wait for solid information on that front. So not only are we finally getting a complete package version of Umineko, which has been in limbo ever since Alchemist went bankrupt halfway through porting the series to PS Vita, but we also received a few pieces of information about the new When They Cry game. Ryukishi is feeling kind, clearly. That being said, nothing is set in stone yet, particularly the release date which is only a “plan,” so maybe it’s best not to get too excited just yet.|Umineko, Higurashi, When They Cry, Ryukishi 07, 07th Expansion
13907|2018-07-16|15:00||http://otaquest.com/metal-gear-31-anniversary-celebrations/| News | Games | Upcoming ‘Metal Gear’ Movie Director Launches 31st Anniversary Celebrations | 31 years ago, gaming was changed forever when the young Hideo Kojima launched his love letter to Hollywood action movies Metal Gear on the MSX. |Thirty-one years ago, gaming was changed forever when the young Hideo Kojima launched his love letter to Hollywood action movies Metal Gear on the MSX. The game deftly wove an intricate and enticing story into engaging stealth gameplay despite technological limitations, kickstarting what would eventually become one of gaming’s most beloved franchises. Last year marked the 30th anniversary of the game’s launch, but Konami hasn’t been exactly friendly towards Kojima lately - even preventing him from receiving an award at The Game Awards in a much-disputed 2015 affair - and thus very little was done to celebrate. With that being said, this year Jordan Vogt-Roberts (Kong: Skull Island, Kings of Summer) is looking to address that. The magnificently bearded director shared on social media the following video, featuring Paul Eiding as Colonel Campbell: ️Follow and retweet this thread to celebrate the 31st anniversary of @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN's METAL GEAR with 31 pieces of never before seen nano-machine-infused-artwork. Tune in every day for new updates. Some surprises along the way... Join me with hastag #METALGEAR31st pic.twitter.com/t6vtydKmiE — Jordan Vogt-Roberts (@VogtRoberts) 13 July 2018 As stated by the Colonel, Vogt-Roberts will be sharing new pieces of artwork he created with several “next-gen” artists every day for the next 31 days to celebrate 31 years of Metal Gear. Although Vogt-Roberts is currently heading pre-production on a Metal Gear movie project, the Colonel was keen to suggest that the artwork will be merely “fan art” and not representative of the movie. At the time of writing, two pieces of artwork featuring Metal Gear Rex and Gray Fox have been released, and both look absolutely incredible, capturing both the serene and action-packed elements of the franchise: DAY 1 of #METALGEAR31st There’s many beautiful+insane+iconic images to come...but I want to start with this piece by Nick Foreman. The bond we formed via mechs reinforced that we should be loud w/ our love of this franchise as we may find friends & collaborators in the process. pic.twitter.com/5Zj4vRsu5T — Jordan Vogt-Roberts (@VogtRoberts) 13 July 2018 DAY 2 of #METALGEAR31st The impeccable @eddiedelrio_art helped me bring the “Gas Mask Samurai” to life in KONG. Cyborg Ninja & the Gekkos are two of the most iconic Hideo Kojima + Yoji Shinkawa designs. I wanted to see their potential in the same frame. Wish I could say more... pic.twitter.com/8OCkWH1zvY — Jordan Vogt-Roberts (@VogtRoberts) 14 July 2018 But I highly doubt that the next 31 days will be as unassuming as Vogt-Roberts suggests. After all, this is a man who has professed his love and idolatry of Hideo Kojima, a creator notorious for deception and surprise - most deftly shown in the character change from Snake to Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. It wouldn’t surprise me if Vogt-Roberts had something up his sleeves for fans, particularly when it comes to the upcoming movie. Furthermore, if you listen closely to the Colonel in the trailer you may pick up on something interesting - that “data” for the movie has been lost behind enemy lines, and that Snake is on his way to retrieve it. This seems to suggest that there is more to come, if not during this celebration then in the near future, provided that Snake can “retrieve” the lost data. Some have suggested that this data may be a trailer, but I would say that the movie is far too early in production to realistically expect this. I’d wager that we might get some information regarding cast, particularly with regards to the role of Snake. In any case, keep your eyes on Vogt-Roberts’ social media in case anything drops about the movie project, but even if that doesn’t end up happening, we get to enjoy some new Metal Gear art every day - sounds like a win-win to me.|Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid, Hideo Kojima, Jordan Vogt-Roberts

Lee is best known for his work in the 90's as the penciler behind Marvel Comics' X-Men #1 (still the highest selling issue of a comic ever printed), as well as a co-founder of the industry shaking Image Comics. Now he is the COO of DC Comics and keeps a very active streak on twitch doing live drawings as well as sharing new artwork regularly on Instagram and Twitter. If you're familiar with his work at all it should not be much of a surprise that he's a fan of anime & video games, showing off sketches of characters like Dragonball Z's Son Goku, and Overwatch's D-Va in the past. Today he took to Instagram and Twitter to show off a sketch he drew of My Hero Academia's All Might, a character who in his muscle form seems ripped directly from an American comic book made in the 1990's. While this clash of a Japanese character with one of America's most prolific comic artists seems like a no-brainer when you consider the facts, we can't ignore how absolutely perfect this pairing is. Had some fun trying something new... All Might from #HeroAcademia #allmight #twitch Next up, Black Canary! https://t.co/qUCvXufpRb pic.twitter.com/eazY4zrNJ8 — Jim Lee (@JimLee) July 15, 2018 Those who know me well know that I am a massive American comic book fan in addition to Japanese manga, and Jim Lee is definitely someone who has had a lot of significance in my appreciation of the artform. The overlap between anime/manga personalities and American comic creators is something I'm an avid purveyor of, often making sure friends in my circles know about American comics & variants that are featuring art by Japanese illustrators (I might just have to do some kind of piece about that down the line), so I couldn't help but jump at the chance to get the word out about this as well. I would love to see what series creator Kohei Horikoshi thinks about the work, maybe we'll have our answer later this week since the two comic giants will be appearing at San Diego Comic Con! In the meantime you can follow Jim Lee on Twitter, Instagram, and twitch.|

But Anime Expo has proven consistently that lives can be a success overseas, and the welcome that the members of Aqours from the Love Live! franchise received at this year’s AX showcases the dazzling potential that these lives could have. The members of Aqours were welcomed by a huge crowd of enthusiastic overseas fans this weekend at the Microsoft Theatre. Much like their Japanese counterparts, they came armed with penlights and happis, showing their dedication and love for the franchise. But they didn’t just come with enthusiasm. They came with a plan - to wow the performers with a rainbow of penlights. In precise timing with the song, fans would change the color of their penlights and raise them to create a rainbow that stretched all the way to the very back of the venue. It was truly a sight to be sold, and the performers were moved to tears. 【World Love Live! in LA】Thank you for coming to "LOVELIVE! SUNSHINE!! Aqours World Love Live! in LA ~Beyond the Pacific~" today! We got such a surprise today from you all!! We look forward to returning to America again!! Thank you so much! Do your Rubesty!! #lovelive pic.twitter.com/HJGxpEt210 — ラブライブ！公式 (@LoveLive_staff) 5 July 2018 Such a sight didn’t come from nothing, however, it was thanks to months of hard work and dedication by the team over at the Aqourainbow Project. Leading up to AX they tirelessly worked to raise awareness about the plan, producing a very detailed video about how the rainbow would work in the Microsoft Theatre and even handing out flyers to raise awareness about the plan outside the venue on the day of the live itself. Seeing their hard work pay off must’ve been a great feeling, and they deserve to be applauded. Here is the finalized flyer that will be PRINTED on July 4th! It is ready and edited with disclaimers everyone has to know! We also want to day this once again... Thank you all so much for reaching this far. This is ALL YOU...YOU made this happen. Let's all do OUR...RUBESTY! pic.twitter.com/P7QcL9vCPJ — AqouRainbow Project (@AX_AqouRainbow) 1 July 2018 Further projects surrounding penlight performance at the live included the Yousoroad and Kananrail Project, which while unfortunately didn’t gain as much traction as the Aqourainbow Project and therefore didn’t happen (Editor's Note: We have received word that the reason for the additional projects not coming to fruition was actually due to the songs Koi ni Naritai Aquarium and Happy Party Train not being performed. We had our information skewed and meant no disrespect to the fans who worked tirelessly to orchestrate these additional tributes.) , showcased a similar level of dedication and love for the franchise. We are excited to share the official #AXYousoRail flyer! We will be handing these out before the live @AnimeExpo with distribution details to be shared later. A huge thank you to the whole team for working hard to make this happen! #Yousoroad #Kananrail pic.twitter.com/zvr2LLfiWd — AX 2018 Yousoroad and Kananrail GO! (@AX_YousoRail) 20 June 2018 And that’s what this live should be telling those who organize them - they can and do work overseas. Overseas fans are just as passionate, just as engaged, and just as willing a customer as a Japanese fan. In fact, the number of obstacles overseas fans have to climb over are more numerous, making them often even more engaged with the franchise - not only the language barrier but also sheer distance, with many Love Live! fans traveling across the country to be in with a chance to see Aquors. Multiple city dates in the US wouldn’t be unprofitable, nor would the welcome be lukewarm. It would be as warm as they get back home. Even Japanese fans were impressed by the enthusiasm and passion of overseas fans, with some exclaiming “They really did a rainbow” and others commenting “The organization of overseas fans is really amazing!”. Furthermore, it seems like the idea for the rainbow is spreading to Japan, with attendees of the Fukuoka live taking place this weekend attempting to organise a repeat of the AX spectacle. It’s worth noting that a fair number of the Fukuoka attendees are actually overseas fans, many of whom choose to enter the ticket lottery for the Fukuoka live because there is a higher chance of winning, but pulling off the rainbow in Fukuoka will definitely inspire Japanese fans to do the same as well. Fans are cooperating and showing their passion in other ways as well. UK-based group Aqours Tea Party are currently lobbying to get a delayed live viewing organised in the UK, the success of which could spell a new dawn for lives in the west. But as it stands, overseas fans have clearly demonstrated their passion and willingness to support lives overseas. What remains to be seen is if that passion will be rewarded. Aqours Tea Party is currently running a general interest survey in a delayed live viewing. You don’t have to be a UK resident to fill it out, so please show your support if that’s something you’d like to see become a reality.|Aquors, Anime Expo, Anison World Matsuri

This week marked the release of the duo's second EP, the fittingly-titled "SUMMER!", as well as the release of an all-new music video for the track "Night Sky (feat. Mashilo & ichika)". It's not too often that an artist can burst onto the scene and leave me clinging on the edge of my seat for their next release, so I'm definitely excited to see how much I can listen to this new EP too. There really is one question on my mind, and that's how long is it going to take before Neko Hacker are picked up to start working on anime OP/EDs? There's an undisputed energy to everything they've released to date that makes for the perfect match, and I can only hope that one day it gets applied fittingly. As a little bonus, you might note featured artist Mashilo as a particularly familiar face, especially if you're familiar with the always incredible CY8ER idol group that she is a member of.

Even if the idea of the new game isn't quite hitting that same sense of nostalgia brought forward when thinking about trying to catch them all during your childhood years, maybe this will tickle your desire to collect them all. The Pokémon Company have this week announced their upcoming "Pokémon Fit" line of plush toys, offering all 151 original Pokémon in an adorable new form. Launching across Japan at numerous Pokémon Center locations, fans will be able to pick up the initial lineup of 30 Pokémon from July 13 and then the remaining 121 Pokémon from November 2018. Priced at roughly $10 a piece, the plush toys are described by The Pokémon Company as palm-sized toys. At that price, it would cost buyers over $1,500 USD to catch them all, if you're able to get your hands on them fast enough. The first run of 30 Pokémon contains a mostly oddball collection of various creatures, while of course containing both Pikachu and Eevee.

It's been a long three years since that very EP released, and Cola Splash is finally back with their latest EP "Cider Stream," which includes the Summer anthem and titular track "Cider Stream" -- something you're bound to be hearing quite a bit over the next few years if you make your way to any club in Tokyo. When tracks like Cola Splash's "Curry Drinker" first dropped back in 2015, saying they redefined just about every DJ's playlist would be an understatement. Even to date, there are very few club events you can attend that won't have at least one remix of the track dropped. So if Cola Splash was going to ever make a comeback, it had to be with something larger than life itself, and though I swore I was totally over vocal chops in 2018 there's absolutely something very special to the execution in tracks like "Cider Stream" that really does shine.

Enabling a new generation of creators access to powerful virtual voicebanks such as that of Hatsune Miku and friends, Yamaha has long tinkered away at creating a powerful software package that is both parts versatile as it is enjoyable. We've seen entire careers birthed out of Vocaloid software, and today, Yamaha announced the launch of the fifth iteration of Vocaloid, as well as the new virtual voices behind it. Announced today via Vocaloid's official website, Vocaloid 5 is now available on PC and Mac via Yamaha's online store. The software will come equipped with four voicebanks and contains well over 1,000 pre-made vocal samples to work with. Those who have worked with Vocaloid in the past will also note the all-new interface, as well as the wide variety of new features bundled in the package. VOCALOID5が本日発売! 特徴 ・Win / Mac、VST / AU対応 ・4ボイスバンク同梱 ・カスタム可能なフレーズ1,000個 ・歌唱スタイル100種 ・抑揚を簡単設定 アタック&リリースエフェクト ・新インターフェイス などここでは語りきれません。 日本語デモ含む詳細はこちら ▶︎ https://t.co/9bGyLVbn2n pic.twitter.com/ovLoVx9KvY — ボーカロイド (@vocaloid_yamaha) 12 July 2018 While in the past we've seen a heavy push for cutesy characters such as Hatsune Miku, it feels like Yamaha is really pushing a more producer-focused base package on this one, though that doesn't mean we won't be seeing more Miku. It's fair enough to suggest that there's probably a handful of artists who have shied away from utilizing Vocaloid software in the past simply due to character designs, so I'm sure Yamaha's stance on this one will allow the software to reach a more international mainstream appeal. Though, I don't think we'll be seeing Chris performing hologram concerts anytime soon: Voicebanks in order: Amy - English Voice Chris - English Voice Kaori - Japanese Voice Ken - Japanese Voice From a producers standpoint, I'm positive that Vocaloid 5 is looking cleaner than ever and I can't wait to see what is pushed out using these new voicebanks. It really seems like every "character" involved is sounding more human than ever before. Though, I'm sure we'll have to wait a little bit until Hatsune Miku V5 comes out until a certain demographic is pleased with the announcement.

This past week left the internet flooded with new information for the upcoming Kill la Kill the Game: IF title from both Studio TRIGGER and Arc System Works, with the recently released Anime Expo 2018 trailer gleaming especially bright. Most importantly, however, is that you can now stream the trailer for the upcoming arena fighter below: Currently slated for a 2019 release timeframe, the upcoming Kill la Kill the Game: IF presents players with an alternate story to the original anime which follows Satsuki Kiryuin as the main character. It was noted during the Studio TRIGGER industry panel that the game would be a completely independent story, and it would later be shared that fans will be able to get their hands on the game for the first time at EVO 2018 in Las Vegas.

Set to begin airing in Japan during October 2018, the much-anticipated JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind anime teaser can be seen below: Coming in hot at just over a minute, fans of the series can expect what will likely be one of the most colorful entries into the series to date. Those who made it to the Western premiere event at Anime Expo '18 would know this too, with the series' first episode premiered on July 6 for the lucky audience that managed to make it inside. My immediate impression of the teaser PV was a feeling of shock that this likely won't be the opening for the series, especially given the immense quality of it.

While progress had been noted in previous years, it truly felt like Anime Expo '18 was the first coherent celebration of Japan's various cultural phenomenon, offering a promising glimpse into the future of the now 26-year-old convention. Before going any further, I'm going to preface this all by mentioning that I am by no means a longtime Anime Expo attendee, with this year being my fifth consecutive year in attendance. With that being said, it doesn't take an extensive attendance history to examine the ever-changing landscape of the North American convention scene; whether you're simply noting changes in events or guests. I'll also mention that I'm not the anime fan that I used to be, with my particular focus leaning towards Japan's music scene as a whole. With all that being said, I stepped into Anime Expo over this past week with a sense of uncertainty, walking away only with good memories and a positive attitude towards something I had honestly been dreading. From the incredible performances by everyone involved at our own m-flo presents "OTAQUEST LIVE" powered by LDH USA and panel events such as the Studio TRIGGER Industry Panel, all the way to world premiere events such as My Hero Academia: Two Heroes' and appearances by industry legends like Go Nagai, Anime Expo 2018 felt like a complete package. With an attendance count of over 110,000 guests all storming to the Los Angeles Convention Center this year, it'll always be difficult to please every single individual. With that being said, you'd be hard-pressed suggesting that there wasn't a single piece of content at Anime Expo this year that didn't appeal to you at all. Whether you were losing your mind to the announcement of new content or dancing your heart out to any of the various Japanese talents that made their way over to North America to perform for you, Anime Expo '18 was, well, actually a whole lot of fun -- at least in my opinion.|Anime Expo, AX, Anime Expo 2018, Anime Conventions
13861|2018-07-11|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/studio-trigger-promare-detailed/| News | Anime | Studio TRIGGER Shares Details About Upcoming Promare Anime | Studio TRIGGER took to the stage at Anime Expo 2018 to share a fresh set of details regarding their upcoming anime series 'Promare' and its characters. |If you were to ask any Western consumer of anime who their favorite anime studio is, chances are you'll hear the name Studio TRIGGER thrown around more often than not. For years now they've been garnering new fans across the world, with the team offering a consistent focus on the North American anime community in particular. This year TRIGGER took things to a whole other level, however, by not only taking over the Anime Expo's largest available panel room -- but also filling it to the brim with even more con-goers desperately trying to get in to see just what the studio was planning on announcing. For those of you that didn't quite make it in, that's most definitely unfortunate, because what Studio TRIGGER had to share was more than enough to leave an impression on us -- especially when it comes to the previously mysterious Promare anime series that the studio is currently working on. Not only was the studio down to share just how little of the project they've actually worked on (hah), but they were also able to show us new details on the series' main hero who we now know as Galo. Our first look at the main character of Studio TRIGGER’s (@trigger_inc) latest anime #Promare at Anime Expo 2018 pic.twitter.com/3dCjD7cJc7 — OTAQUEST (@otaquest) 7 July 2018 Despite what the hundreds of instantaneous responses would suggest, that isn't actually Kamina from Gurren Lagann. Instead, you're looking at the slightly-dimwitted hero of Promare's story, Galo. There were a few notes shared about him and how he comes into the big picture, most notably being his American-like appearance and outfit that would give off the impression of a fireman. Studio TRIGGER wasn't shy to share that he is part of a rescue team, and though he isn't necessarily the brightest, his strong will of heart will certainly make him a lovable protagonist. Joining our main character will be his Matoi Tech robot, a wordplay on a classic Edo period piece of rescue equipment that would warn civilians of a nearby fire. If asked to describe the Matoi Tech, it'd be a weird blend between the visual design of Ryuko Matoi's Kamui Senketsu and Simon's own Lagann. Perhaps most exciting, however, is the announcement that Sushio will be handling the animation for the Matoi Tech, noting that he is stepping away from his idol addiction for a short period of time to work on the anime project. While we certainly won't be seeing the anime project any time soon, Studio TRIGGER sure do know how to keep us on the edge of our seats with their announcements. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is announced. |Promare, Studio TRIGGER, Trigger
13860|2018-07-07|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/studio-trigger-patreon/| News | Anime | Studio TRIGGER Launches Patreon to Support Staff, Create Content | Studio TRIGGER has never been the type to shy away from asking their global fanbase for support in creating new and exciting works, with their newly-launched Patreon simply being the next step. |The legendary Studio TRIGGER has always been a forward-thinking studio; coupled with their independent spirit and explosive original style, and it'll come as no surprise that they have jumped the pack yet again and gone out of the box for their latest venture. You might remember just a few short years ago when Studio TRIGGER looked to fans around the globe to help fund the studio's latest animated project, Little Witch Academia. Now, they're looking to the global anime community for something a little longer-lasting, coming in the form of their recently launched Patreon. Patreon has seen rapid growth in the past couple of years due to it’s ability to directly connect fans with creators both financially and communicatively and Studio TRIGGER intend to use it just for that. As a studio that values communication with its fans, they hope that Patreon will allow more direct communication through the utilization of their Patreon feed, which can be unlocked by merely pledging $1. Furthermore, they admit that they have had to scrap ideas in the past - particularly when it comes to merchandising and that Patreon could help them to earn an “extra buck or two.” The Patreon was announced during the TRIGGER panel at Anime Expo 2018 and currently features two pledge tiers. Funilly enough, the announcement was also meant to go live during the panel too until the realization of the lack of internet in the convention room sunk in. The “TRIGGER Supporter” tier is available for $1 and will grant fans access to a .jpg file of the image drawn during planned drawing livestreams with the studio's animators and artists, and the “TRIGGER Happy” tier is available for $5, which grants fans the same rewards from the previous tier as well as access to the studio file that will have all of the layers of the image attached. Obviously, the Patreon will reward fans of the studio’s work, as well as those fans more keenly interested in how TRIGGER staff work by examining the layers of the image file. But more than that, the launch of the Patreon promises more direct contact with the fans than ever before. Previously, TRIGGER has always had to consult with financiers and producers to secure funding for projects and thus produce works for fans, but with the launch of the Patreon that dynamic could quickly change. Although it would be naïve to suggest that full animated projects could be realized off the Patreon - the most TRIGGER have been able to do with crowdfunding was the Little Witch Academia OVAs, after all - it certainly spells an interesting future for merchandising in particular. Producing merchandise that the fans want, for a price that the fans choose - that certainly sounds like an interesting prospect. That being said, the Patreon is very much being set up right now, with the first drawing livestream yet to be scheduled, and with much of the initial income from the Patreon going to be used to buy equipment for said livestream. Currently sitting at just under $4,000 USD at the time of writing, with over 1,200 backers in its first 24 hours, it's easy to see things are going quite well. It's no secret that some of the greatest Studio TRIGGER works are the ones where they're given complete creative freedom, something that's difficult to achieve without self-funding; giving all the more reason to be excited about this project.

But fans are struggling to get excited - even with Aoyama announcing that the series will be nearing a conclusion after over twenty years of publication. With that in mind, Shonen Sunday detailed in this week’s issue their plans to keep fans engaged. *Spoilers Below* They plan to do this by publishing Amuro Toru spinoff Zero’s Teatime when Detective Conan is on hiatus, and when Conan is off hiatus, Teatime will cease publication inversely. This way, fans can continue to get their weekly dose of Conan (and have an excuse to buy Sunday every week). Sounds good, right? But the announcement that the series will be nearing a conclusion is hardly exciting or unexpected for fans of the manga, as most of the mystery surrounding the antagonistic ‘Black Organization’ has already been solved, with Amuro or Bourbon being one of the final keys. There are still some members of the organization still left to be revealed, but the reveal of such characters would essentially wrap up the overarching plot - therefore explaining why Aoyama has announced that the manga will be nearing a conclusion given that he does indeed intend to explain the mysteries of these remaining characters. Furthermore, Detective Conan has always moved at a slow pace due to Aoyama’s own tendency to get sidetracked in interesting mysteries and conundrums. So even if these final mysteries are going to be solved, fans aren’t expecting this to happen any time soon. Why should they go out and buy Sunday every week, when waiting a while and then reading would prevent them from getting annoyed by the pacing? In addition, due to Aoyama’s age, it seems like hiatuses will be all but unavoidable in the series going forward, as he has already suffered illness due to the hectic environment of serialization. Obviously, alternating Conan’s slot in the magazine with Zero’s Teatime does ensure that there is regular content for the series, but the two stories are progressing separately and in very different ways - hardly solving the problem. What’s more is that many fans have actually expressed their distaste for the recent Amuro boom, evidenced by Zero’s Teatime as well as the twenty-second movie, as it seems as though Edogawa Conan is being replaced by Amuro as the main character of his own franchise. Rotating Conan and Teatime in the magazine only gives the two series equal billing and thus affirming this growing worry. No matter how much Sunday want to give fans Conan content, if that content is actively disliked by a large part of the fanbase, then I wonder what good it can do. That being said, I do admire the fact that Aoyama and Sunday are taking steps to make hiatuses less insufferable for fans, especially as the series nears its conclusion. Several problems with the current state of Detective Conan still persist, but at least steps are being taken to solve those problems.|Detective Conan, Case Closed, Detective Conan Hiatus
13852|2018-07-05|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/my-hero-academia-four-years/| News | Manga | ‘My Hero Academia’ Author Reflects on Four Years of Serialization | It’s hard to believe that four years have passed since the mega-popular My Hero Academia began serialization, and author Kohei Horikoshi has also barely had time to take stock of this between his strict serialization schedule. |It’s hard to believe that four years have passed since the mega-popular My Hero Academia began serialization, and author Kohei Horikoshi has also barely had time to take stock of this between his strict serialization schedule and cooperation for anime, game and now movie projects. He finally had the chance to unload, however, thanks to a special commemorative interview with Comic Natalie, and the way he reflects on his series thus far is truly fascinating. *Spoiler Alert for both My Hero Academia anime & manga* The interview began by discussing the latest volumes, mainly the ones containing the ‘Intern arc,’ which have not yet adapted for the anime. When compared to other arcs in the series, this arc is very dark, surprising me as I read each week due to its excellent character development and pacing, and Horikoshi couldn’t agree more. He worried constantly that the arc was too dark, as the tone of his previous arcs had been relatively playful. That being said, Horikoshi did admit that his emotions “flip-flop” when writing, so his own personality didn’t help much with this unease. Further setting apart the Intern arc from previous arcs is its length. Whereas other arcs span one volume, maybe two volumes at most, this arc spans five volumes - letting it develop and mature in ways never seen before in the series. Horikoshi wanted to try and do a longer arc since his arcs tend to be short, but he was also looking to another Jump giant for inspiration - Eiichiro Oda’s One Piece. Oda’s manga is characterized by long, sprawling arcs that span tens of volumes, and Horikoshi wanted to try his hand at this as well. Luckily it worked very well, but it’s still interesting to see how much Jump mangaka are influenced by each other - truly setting the magazine apart from the countless others that line the shelves. With the anime just wrapping up the All Might versus One For All fight, leading to ‘All Might’ becoming number 1 trending worldwide, Comic Natalie also took the opportunity to ask Horikoshi what his thought process was behind this fight - particularly with regards to All Might losing his powers. Horikoshi is thinking long-term with this it seems, as he stated that he wanted people to remember that fight as the best part of the manga when they look back on the series once it has finished. It certainly seems like a long way before the series finishes, but I can’t fault Horikoshi for thinking long-term. Once more taking the long view, Horikoshi also reflected on how his own ideas as to the themes of the series have changed since beginning serialization, mainly regarding the major theme of “what makes a hero.” At first, Horikoshi professed, he had a much simpler view of what it means to be a hero, but with the development of the story so too have his thoughts on the matter developed. He now believes there are multiple things that make a hero, reflected in the many characters he has created. This would explain why the moral boundary in the series has blurred considerably recently, with the character of Gentle Villain being the main cause of that. Comic Natalie then attempted to extract some new information regarding the upcoming film from the mangaka, but Horikoshi remained remarkably tight-lipped. We hardly got any indication as to where the manga might end up in the future also. So we didn't necessarily get any new information, but I say let the man reflect - he’s earned it.|My Hero Academia, Boku no Hero Academia, Horikoshi Kouhei, Weekly Shonen Jump, Shonen Jump, Kohei Horikoshi
13851|2018-07-05|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/live-action-shouwa-genroku/| News | Anime , Manga | Live-Action Could be Big Break for ‘Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu’ | Haruko Kumota’s 'Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu' is about to get some much-deserved love with the announcement of a live-action drama being in the works. |I’ve always thought that Haruko Kumota’s Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu deserved more love, with both the manga and anime only garnering moderate success in small circles. But the recent announcement that the series will be getting a live-action drama adaptation could be the first step towards getting the recognition it deserves. The series follows the story of Yakumo Yuurakutei and his pupil Yotarou as they develop their craft as traditional Japanese storytellers, commonly referred to as rakugo performers. This style of Japanese storytelling was what initially drew me into to the series, as it features only one performer with minimal staging and props, therefore relying solely on the storyteller’s own skill. But more than a story about rakugo, this is a story of tragic fates and a meditation on the inevitability of generation sin, and it was never able to reach as many people as it should have. While the anime and manga might have fallen short in pulling the audience it deserves, a drama could be the series’ big break. Although it hardly seems like it, the original manga is steeped in josei tropes - manga meant for older women - and the fact that the majority of those who watch dramas in Japan are women could mean that it strikes a real chord with an already predisposed audience. After all, anime is predominantly a male pastime, which could also explain why the anime never garnered the popularity it deserved. Furthermore, attaching star power to the series could bring in yet more viewers, particularly with an already established star such as Masaki Okada, who will be playing the main character Yakumo. He already has an extensive and varied filmography, starring in the popular lawyer drama Legal High as well as some other manga adaptations such as the live-action film of Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable. Such an established star will surely bring in viewers, with at least his die-hard fans surely planning on tuning in. It seems that Okada is ready to give his all for the series as well, stating that he is “in the middle of studying the classics of rakugo” and that “the more I learn about it the more I love it.” I must admit I was skeptical when I saw that such a young heartthrob would be playing the withered, bitter Yakumo, but if Okada is genuinely as passionate about the project as he claims he is, then I’m sure he’ll give his all. That being said, he has a huge task ahead of him in trying to match Akira Ishida’s haunting performance as Yakumo in the anime. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens with the drama adaptation, but I certainly have high hopes. It is slated to begin broadcast on October 12 this year on NHK and will follow the manga closely in order to honor the characters and world that Kumota created. If you’re interested in checking out the series beforehand, then both the manga and anime are available in English.|Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Haruko Kumota

For me personally, Inoue’s work on The iDOLM@STER franchise has been instrumental in sustaining my love for the franchise, so I’d like to take the opportunity to reflect on his incredible contributions to the iDOLM@STER songbook over the years. Inoue was first given an opportunity to write a song for the series under his own name in 2014, following some involvement with the soundtrack for The iDOLM@STER 2 in 2011, and he definitely delivered on that chance. Appearing in ONE FOR ALL, ‘99 Nights’ is one of the best songs in the whole series, as it’s funky, glitchy beat allowed lyricist MC TC to write some sultry, poetic lyrics for the equally sultry and poetic Takane Shijou to perform. This song marked a large departure from the happy, upbeat songs that were common in this era of the series to darker, more electronic-infused songs - which would in turn become a mainstay of modern iM@S music. We had to wait a long time for Inoue to return to 765 Production and follow up on his excellent debut, but when he finally did with the release of ‘Miracle Night’ in Platinum Stars’ first DLC pack, it was well worth it. Miracle Night follows in the electronic footsteps of 99 Nights but amps up the volume and sheer mass of sound, creating an excellent club-like dance hit, with which once more lyricist MC TC was able to write some genuinely inspiring and uplifting lyrics. This is easily one of the best original songs to come out of 765 Production in years, as it injects new life into the now over 10 years old series. Inoue’s work on Cinderella Girls is nothing to sneer at either, as he has also consistently produced some of 346 Production’s best hits. He started with Mirai Akagi’s character song ‘Romantic Now,’ which has always been a fan favorite due to it’s catchy and upbeat tempo. Inoue’s instrumentals on this track are also excellent, fusing Inoue’s tendency for electronic sounds with a bubbly feeling perfect for the character of Mirai. This was followed up by another fan favorite, Kanade Hayami’s character song ‘Hotel Moonside.’ Inoue returns to his electronic roots here in full form, creating another club hit much like Miracle Night, but this time with a much more distinctly sexy tone. The harsh tones of the track give it a raw and aggressive feeling, pairing perfectly with Kanade’s aggresively flirtatious personality. Furthermore, this song has serious mainstream appeal away from fans of the series, as I’ve had many people profess to me that they love the song despite not knowing anything about the series - all thanks to Inoue. Inoue’s last major contribution to Cinderella Girls was Yui Ohtsuki’s character song ‘Radio Happy,’ and it certainly makes for one hell of a swan song. The way the track opens with the changing of audio channels from left to right is always enticing, and once you’re pulled in there’s no chance of escaping. Inoue’s distorted yet bubbly instrumentations will get you tapping your feet, and then once the beat drops you’ll be dancing along in no time. Radio Happy alone was responsible for drawing me out of a long retirement from the Cinderella Girls franchise, and it’s Inoue I have to be thankful to. Aside from iDOLM@STER, Inoue has also contributed to many other Bandai Namco franchises, particularly in the fighting game TEKKEN and racing classic Ridge Racer, but Inoue has influenced me through iM@S more than anything else. When I looked at his involvement in the franchise and saw that he made so many of my favorite, and indeed fan favorite songs, I realised that if it wasn’t for his hard work, I’m sure that I, and many others, would be a completely different person. iM@S has changed my life, and a large part of that is thanks to Inoue. So wherever he ends up, I wish him good luck.|taku inoue, iDOLM@STER, Idolmaster, Bandai Namco

BEAMS Japan have teamed up with Devilman crybaby to deliver some devilishly cool threads, along with some seriously stylish accessories. First up is this black t-shirt featuring Silene and Devilman, the design of which is actually taken directly from the original manga: Next up is some love for one of Yuasa’s most inventive reimaginings of Nagai’s original characters in the form of Devil Cat, which floats adorably yet menacingly in the design of this white t-shirt: A strikingly more sombre offering comes in a t-shirt based on Akira’s iconic line from the original manga “Go to hell, you damned humans!”. The front of the black t-shirt boldy screams so, while the back of the t-shirt features a subtle print of the panel in which Akira says the line: It’s interesting to note that Akira does not actually say this line in Yuasa’s adaptation, so the collaboration t-shirts seem to take more of an inspiration from the original than crybaby. Fine by me, considering that the goods up for grabs as part of this collaboration actually focus more on the crybaby side of things. An outlandishly large phone case based on Akira’s pose in the initial poster for crybaby is first up, followed by a seriously stylish leather card case, on the inside of which is engraved a picture of the enigmatic duo, Ryo and Akira. Whereas the phone case is bit too much for my tastes, I can certainly see myself using the card case as a subtle yet stylish way to show my love for the series. Furthermore, although it’s far too hot for a hoodie of any kind in Japan at the moment, there is an excellent collaboration hoodie on offer. The back of the hoodie is emblazoned with the word ’crybaby’ as well as red cruciform or halo, depending on whether you pick the ‘Akira’ or ‘Ryo’ version, which are black and white respectively. The left sleeve also has the desperate last words of Miki on it, and opening up the hoodie itself will reveal the poster for crybaby emblazoned right where your heart is - if you’re not a demon, that is. But the real star of the show here has to be this beautiful collaboration backpack. Not only is it functional with lots of pockets and sleeves, but it’s also incredibly stylish. The cruciform made up of piercings definitely wouldn’t be out of place in Shibuya, and the blood red label accents the otherwise dull black body. It’s rather expensive at around 13,000 yen, but it’s definitely worth the money. This collection is certainly one of the best I’ve seen, with pieces that both honor the series as well as being genuinely stylish. Perhaps it was foolish to expect anything less of the legendary Devilman, but consider me surprised.

That being said, a new challenger appeared out of left field this weekend, carrying with her a sizeable amount of clout. That challenger is no other than Super Sonico. Super Sonico began as a mascot character for a Nitroplus music festival in 2006, but quickly gained a popularity of her own. Since then she has appeared in manga, anime, games and photo books. Her latest game, Sonicomi, was dubbed and released in English in 2016. But the above video marks Sonico’s debut as a virtual YouTuber, and it seems rather uninteresting at first glance. But, as fans of Sonico may pick up, she mentions that she has moved “agencies,” perhaps signalling new developments in the Sonico canon. Whether or not this is an agency to do with her work as a member of the band First Astronomical Velocity or as a gravure model is unclear, but we’re promised new information “soon,” so there may be some original storytelling arriving on the YouTube channel every very soon. In addition, when comparing the model used in the video to the models used in the latest Super Sonico title, the gravure photography Sonicomi game for PC, it seems completely different - leading me to believe that Unity is being used, the same software as used by many other prolific virtual YouTubers. This does beg the question of why Nitroplus wouldn’t use their own software, but it’s probably safe to assume that using Unity turned out to be easier. That being said, even if you hate Sonico it’s hard to dismiss the effect that she could have on the virtual YouTuber scene. After all, behind her is the development giant Nitroplus, responsible for the legendary Steins;Gate and the BL smash hit DRAMAtical Murder, who will no doubt funnel considerable resources into Sonico’s activities as a virtual YouTuber. Furthermore, the change in dynamic from independently operated channels to corporate owned and operated channels could represent a new phase in the phenomenon itself, perhaps leading to other licensed characters appearing as virtual YouTubers as some point. That’s certainly an exciting thought to entertain.|super sonico, youtube, Virtual YouTuber

Released on June 27 here in Japan, the group additionally released an all-new music video for the EP's opening song "The Bamboo Princess". Much like everything else put out by Wednesday Campanella, both the EP and music video have been on permanent repeat since they first released, each playthrough offering a different set of questions and meaning: Their latest music video for "The Bamboo Princess" features lyrics written by Wednesday Campanella front-woman KOM_I and additionally features composition by group member Kenmochi Hidefumi. Much like most other songs released by Wednesday Campanella, we find ourselves looking back at a classic Japanese folktale, this time giving attention to The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, and questioning whether or not Princess Kaguya was actually an alien, as well as what preceded and proceded the tale. With such a powerful opening to the EP, we're then offered an additional seven songs making for eight tracks in total. Of those on the EP, we also see the recently released "Matryoshka" which features French psychedelic rock band Moodoïd. I couldn't urge those reading this to listen to the "Galapagos" EP more, and you should absolutely give it a listen, here.|Wednesday Campanella, Suiyobi no Campanella, Galapagos, The Bamboo Princess

It would be in April 2017, however, that the series' cult-following would be taken to new levels when series director Sayo Yamamoto revealed to us in an interview that there was a Yuri!!! on ICE animated film on the horizon, though she remained tight-lipped outside of that brief announcement. "We can’t stop, we won’t stop, we refuse to stop!! ", as Sayo Yamamoto so graciously put it after excitedly announcing the upcoming film project. That announcement would later be made public at the Yuri!!! on STAGE event that took place in 2017, and over a year later one might assume that we're finally ready to hear some more details on the film. With that being said, even we're going into this one blind, but we can't wait to see what ends up being the "major announcement" that is to be made.

With a total of four tracks, it really feels like Miyamoto's latest release perfectly embodies the sound that TREKKIE TRAX spent the last six years so perfectly curating, filled with hard-hitting drops, amen breaks, and just the right flair to scream TREKKIE TRAX' signature sound. These tracks all absolutely slap, which comes as little surprise given Ryuki Miyamoto was behind them all. Available as of today on most major streaming sites and services, as well as being available for purchase via iTunes, it'll come as little surprise when you hear these tracks absolutely dominating the Tokyo club scene's playlists over the next few months.

Calling on some of the Japanese electronic music scene's greatest, the long-running series of ads have this time called on production trio Pa's Lam System, with the assistance of a virtual variant of actor Takayuki Yamada. Easily one of the best parts about the music video, Pa's Lam System go absolutely ham in showcasing their numerous production styles and abilities all within a single comprehensive three-minute video. Just couple in Takayuki Yamada's robot-like voice into the track, as well as the high-paced transitions between upcoming titles, and you've got a wild ride of a video. Featuring a number of already available, as well as upcoming titles on the console as well, you could also look at this as a good introduction as to what's coming out soon in Japan. In the past, Sony has called on fellow netlabel-gone-major artists such as Tofubeats and Banvox to produce for their music videos, so it's exciting to see the trend continued with their latest.

With each and every release, the AAA member seemingly showcases an entirely new skill set that stands proudly next to the rest of his extensive catalog. Namely, this time I'm talking about his latest "Snatchaway" single and its accompanying music video, made especially notable by the fact that the song is being used as the theme song for New GUNDAM BREAKER on PlayStation 4. Last time we were writing about SKY-HI we were talking about his "Diver's High" single release, yet another track that exists impossibly different from something like "Snatchaway," but that's not something to be taken lightly. While SKY-HI is undeniably an incredible performer on his own, there's a lot of credit owed to the collaborators who he brings on to produce his music, ultimately allowing for so much variety in sound. Last time we saw UNISON SQUARE GARDEN guitarist Saito Kousuke jam out, and this time we're seeing THE SUPER FLYERS take on this track. There's an undeniable Summer vibe to "Snatchaway", and perhaps that's why I'm finding myself drawn enough to write about it; though I'll absolutely admit I've had it on repeat for the last bit of my night. |sky-hi, SKY HI, Snatchaway, NEW GUNDAM BREAKER, GUNDAM BREAKER

13797|2018-06-27|14:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/crystal-kay-bust-a-groove/| News | Games | Crystal Kay Seemingly Confirms Long Assumed Bust A Groove Involvement | During her Instagram Live to promote m-flo presents OTAQUEST LIVE powered by LDH on June 26th, Crystal Kay confirmed her involvement with cult-classic rhythm game 'Bust A Groove' during a passing moment. |A long time assumption regarding the cult classic PlayStation rhythm game Bust A Groove was confirmed in the unlikeliest of ways earlier today. For nearly 20 years it's been speculated that Crystal Kay was responsible for the vocals in the English language version of Shorty's song (named "Shorty & The EZ Mouse" by fans due to its chorus) before her major label debut in 1999. Unfortunately, confirmation has been out of our grasp as the game's credits don't list information on the individual songs or credit the artists who worked on them. That all changed today when during a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment of her Instagram Live session, Crystal Kay made mention of the song, sang the titular line from the chorus, and reminisced about how long ago that was when a fan asked about her video game work. Later, someone in the chat mentioned that she should sing the song during her upcoming performance in Los Angeles and she acknowledged the comment as well. Granted that this isn't what I would call a hard confirmation, it certainly may as well be and is the kind of thing that die-hard fans of the franchise are surely just as pleased to hear about as I am. There is a lot of mystery around the US releases of Enix's fan-favorite but unfortunately long-dead dancing game franchise, so any information that pops up is practically treasure. Especially 20 years after the title's release. This also comes right on the heels of "The Heat Is On" vocalist Aaron G. releasing an updated dance reworking of his track on all major music distribution platforms just a few days ago. For me personally, being a longtime fan of the franchise (I still have my original copies of the games to this day), these sudden and surprising acknowledgments of a franchise that many people hold fond memories for (despite how niche it is) have really been great to see. One can only hope that Square Enix comes out of nowhere with some kind of acknowledgment of their own.|crystal kay, Bust A Groove, Bust A Move, Playstation, Rhythm Game

13796|2018-06-27|10:00||http://otaquest.com/code-vein-e3-2018/| News | Games | Hands on with Code Vein at E3 2018 | We went hands on with the much anticipated Bandai Namco title, Code Vein, at E3 2018. Here are our impressions of the hard as nails action game. |I think to start off by saying, “Hmm, Code Vein is kind of anime Dark Souls” except published by Bandai Namco can come off as too reductive. But also to some extent, that's exactly what it is. To get you in the headspace of what Code Vein is trying to pull off, it’s effective and also setting out to be a flashier action game with the same kind of heart, brutal difficulty and lessons through death. While on their own this sounds like a bit of a knock-off, but seriously, I can’t reiterate enough just how much Code Vein’s style and charm went in the brief amount of time I spent with it on the E3 2018 show floor. The demo was a guided section through an underground mountainous cavern with some creepy looking enemies, which on its own has a very Souls-like sound to it, but it served as a great introduction to the enemies and abilities that far separate Code Vein from its comparisons. I played my entire demo with a companion, a party member, named Mia, who has been a huge part of much of the advertising for the game. She had some ability to heal me if I died on my journey and also generally held her own in combat. It was a completely different feel than, say, a summoned ally in Dark Souls for sure. It felt more like a companion character in an RPG, who you can level up and who will stand with you. What’s important is that Mia had her own health and healing items, and while she could heal you, I didn’t notice any way to aid her. She could die independent of you, and she’d rejoin you at the next rest point. At these rest points you can light them, and then rest at them to fast travel, level up, and of course, reset all enemy spawns. The gameplay itself takes a lot of hints from a slower paced action game, but it was definitely faster than Dark Souls specifically, finding a spot somewhere between that and Devil May Cry. It felt like Bloodborne let’s say. Light and heavy attacks were mapped to front facing buttons, but guarding and parrying were on your left shoulder buttons The combination of attacks seriously reminded me both of Bloodborne, and also specifically of Nioh, which opted for a similar control scheme. Running up and combo-ing between light and heavy attacks felt natural and responsive, with a big emphasis on a frain ability, where your bloody hand turned massive and launched a clawing attack directly at the enemy. This allowed you to gain more of the currency you earned for killing enemies, and it felt like a good finisher to any string of combo attacks. Code Vein players can also make use of “Gifts” that run on opponents’ blood; improved strength and speed, overpowered assaults and new weapons can all be unlocked with these gory add-ons. While I know the comparisons to Dark Souls aren’t in short supply, the aesthetic easily brought something fresh to Code Vein that we can all be excited for. I was eventually able to jump to a boss fight right at the end, and it was about as tough and brutal as you’d hope from a game harkening to this style of gameplay. The boss consisted of a tall knight-looking character with an impressively designed sword and shield combo. His move-set consisted of regular melee attacks as well as teleporting above you and slashing down hard, making you need to roll out to avoid. So roughly after 3-4 deaths, I finally managed to beat the boss in about 4 minutes real time. Having a companion definitely took a slight load off without being in the way of my attacks and concentration, but the difficulty was still there throughout. It was a blast and seemed like the kind of try, die, and try again game that other Souls fans like me would really enjoy, with its own unique take on the look and feel of the genre. Code Vein is set to release on September 28, 2018 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. |Code Vein, Bandai Namco, e3 2018, Hands On, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

13787|2018-06-26|16:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/gorillaz-now-now-debut/| News | Music | Gorillaz Debut Entire New Release 'The Now Now' in Tokyo | Legendary animated rock band Gorillaz performer their entire upcoming album, The Now Now, live in Tokyo days ahead of its release. |Damon Albarn & Jamie Hewlett's legendary animated band, Gorillaz, hit the stage in Tokyo to debut their entire upcoming album 'The Now Now' days ahead of release on a Boiler Room live stream. The decision to choose Tokyo as the setting for this debut actually makes a lot of sense when you consider the history of the band. As far back as their first self-titled release in 2001 the influence of Japanese culture on the creative team behind the foursome was incredibly apparent. Band member Noodle hails from Japan and has been represented in songs by vocalist Miho Hatori of the Japanese trip-hop group Cibo Matto. In an interview for WIRED (conducted by literary legend Neil Gaiman), Gorillaz designer Jamie Hewlett also makes mention of taking a lot of inspiration from the works of Studio Ghibli for the imagery in their album 'Demon Days'. Japan has very frequently played a heavy influence on Western musicians for years, but it's not terribly often that an act as globally recognized as Gorillaz chooses Tokyo as the setting for a milestone, or acknowledges that influence in such a serious way. It may not be the kind of thing that most fans are going to realize while listening to the new album, but the gesture definitely isn't lost on us. As a fan of Gorillaz from the very beginning and someone who holds Japanese culture in extremely high regard, it's always a treat for me to see East & West collide in unexpected ways. If you're wondering about the show at Boiler Room itself, it was a solid 44 minute performance of the entire album accompanied by a visual feast, as is very typical of a Gorillaz live show. The live stream of the show was available to view via YouTube for 24 hours, ending this morning, but if you search enough we're sure you can find clips floating around the internet. Several music videos and clips for the new album have already hit YouTube courtesy of the band, and their new release 'The Now Now' will be available everywhere this Friday, June 29th.|Gorillaz, The Now Now, tokyo, Boiler Room, Live Music, Debut
13788|2018-06-26|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-online-features/| News | Games | Square Enix Floating Several Ideas for Online Elements in Kingdom Hearts III | Kingdom Hearts III director Tetsuya Nomura shared in a recent interview that he's been floating several different ideas for online functionality in the upcoming game. |In a recent interview with Dengeki PlayStation Magazine, Kingdom Hearts III director Tetsuya Nomura shared a number of new details about the upcoming game, including the possible inclusion of online functionality. Coming in just days after another recent interview with Famitsu Magazine where it was revealed that the game would not be receiving a "Final Mix," but rather opting for DLC sans the season pass, it seems the previously tight-lipped Nomura is finally ready to share just what's going on behind the scenes at Square Enix. While a number of different elements that are being planned for the game were discussed, the team at Siliconera were kind enough to summarize some of the most important points from the interview below: Several plans are currently under consideration for Kingdom Hearts III’s online elements. Nomura reiterated that there’s a chance there might not be enough space to fit everything with the great volume of content that is being made for Kingdom Hearts III. Nomura says he wants to put in online elements, but asks fans to keep their consoles connected online while waiting for the time being. The director says he currently doesn’t have any leeway to take measures for a Kingdom Hearts III demo. Everyone’s stories will wrap up in Kingdom Hearts III. This was one of the propositions for the game. In order to get the ideal hue for the limited edition Kingdom Hearts III PS4 Pro, they had it remade countless times. Nomura says you’ll get a better idea when you see it for yourself, but its kind of like leather. There's a lot to take in here, and just as many questions to be asked; what sort of online elements are we looking at being implemented? Just how big of a game is Kingdom Hearts III going to be if they can't fit everything into a single package? With the game currently slated for a January 29, 2019 release date, we're ultimately not going to have to wait too much longer to find out -- and I'm sure we'll be hearing further news shared ahead of the game's release too. With how many times Kingdom Hearts III was delayed, it comes in as little surprise to hear that they're struggling with the size of it, but I'm definitely intrigued as to what the online elements will entail. Until further information is revealed, however, you can check out even more about the upcoming title on Kingdom Hearts III's official website.

Released at the end of last week, the manga's first volume compiles what really can only be described as Bkub Okawa's signature sense of humor. Sticking to that same four-panel formula that the creative had defined themselves with during the past, the series originally launched via Morning Two magazine in February 2017. Featuring a wide-array of cats from all different walks of life, you'll see a number of different felines represented in the manga's first volume. Available now across Japan, there's currently no word on an English-language release of the four-panel manga. That being said, this is a new series by the same person who brought Pop Team Epic to life, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few eyes from the industry already looking at this one.

Originally recorded in the Summer of 1981, both Izumi Kobayashi (Mimi Kobayashi) and Fumitaka Anzai worked together on lyrics, composition, and score to bring together the track. In the posting, Anzai noted that because this is the first demo of the track, listeners can note both different lyrics and sound. Now I might just be getting ahead of myself with this part, but something particularly interesting also mentioned in the upload is the fact that the decision to upload the demo online was made during a recent gathering involving both Fumitaka Anzai and Izumi Kobayashi at the studio the recording originally took place at. While I wouldn't be surprised if the two frequently gather for a light lunch or something of the sort, it does seem like a pretty big coincidence that this all happened just weeks after the previously shared Otaku Spirit Sessions event that brought together all the biggest names in Future Funk and Anime into that very studio, including both Anzai and Kobayashi. Coming in at just under a minute and a half, this piece of anime music history is one that I'm glad is being preserved digitally for a whole new generation of listeners.

Reflected gorgeously in his slightly off-tune color palettes and camera styles, Yamada really brings together the complete package with his work on "Onna wa Kawaru". Stemming from their upcoming album "Sukinara Towanai" which is set to release across Japan on August 29, 2018, the release is being joined by a nationwide tour beginning in Sapporo and ending in Tokyo.

The news comes just a day after the game's release date for Japan was officially announced, meaning owners of the Switch won't need to wait much longer to get their hands on the fighter. Originally announced at E3 2018 for the Nintendo Switch, the game released during January for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Developed by Arc System Works and based on Akira Toriyama's legendary Weekly Shonen Jump series Dragon Ball, there are few fighters that had been requested make their way to Switch more-so than Dragon Ball FighterZ. While I've long enjoyed other fighting titles in the franchise such as the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi games, it'll be exciting to finally be able to get my hands on what many are lauding to be the best Dragon Ball game to date. Update: In addition to the release date news, it was revealed that pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch version of the title will come with the Japan Exclusive Super Famicom Dragon Ball fighting game Super Butoden, as well as the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan versions of Goku and Vegeta. Set to release on Nintendo Switch on September 28, 2018, in the West, further details on Dragon Ball FighterZ can be found via its official website.

The news came through a quick statement at the end of the presentation from Hirohiko Araki himself, simply announcing that the anime was underway and will be premiering later this year during Autumn under the name JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind. The following key visual was also revealed: 荒木飛呂彦記者会見 速報 アニメ5部 今秋スタートッ！！ pic.twitter.com/mtvoF6i1or — ｻｻﾑﾈ㌠杜王町@6/30 麺屋承太郎 (@sasamune3) 21 June 2018 Coming in at the 45-second mark of the above video, we see Araki announcing one of the most anticipated adaptations in a matter of 20 seconds. Set in Italy, the fifth-arc to the JoJo story follows Giorno Giovanna as he attempts to work his way up within the Neapolitan Mafia and become a full-fledged "Gang-Star". Alongside the announcement, not much further details were shared beyond the fact that we could expect the anime during the aforementioned time frame. The original manga is described below: Naples, 2001. Giorno Giovanna is a small-time crook with one big dream—to become a "Gang-Star." No ordinary thief, Giorno has a connection to the remarkable Joestar bloodline, and possesses a Stand named Gold Experience. His dream starts to become reality when he meets Bruno Buccellati, a mobster from the gang Passione and a fellow Stand user himself. Realizing that they share similar ideals, and both disagree with the gang's harmful affairs, Giorno reveals his goal to Bruno: with Bruno's help, he will reform Passione by overthrowing the boss. As Giorno becomes a member of Passione, and is inducted into Bruno's squad, he discovers that it is no simple gang; its numbers are teeming with Stand users. Now confronted by other squads of differing loyalties and unpredictable caliber, their goal to change the gang from the inside out will be a tough one. Taking on these adversaries, Giorno attempts to rise through the ranks and inch closer to the boss, a man who is shrouded in mystery. There will be a special screening of the series' first episode taking place at Anyerri Hall in Tokyo and simultaneously at Japan Expo in Paris at the same time on July 5. Later that week, there will be a North American first episode reveal at Anime Expo on July 7 in Los Angeles.

Uploaded onto King Records' YouTube channel earlier today, the video has already garnered over 300,000 views, and rightfully so. Included in the upload is a new HD music video, which features various scenes from the original anime series. When it comes to anime theme songs, there are very few as easily recognizable as "The Cruel Angel's Thesis", something that rings especially true in Japan. This is a song that, on numerous occasions, has been voted as the one song not to sing at karaoke because it has simply been heard that many times by everyone in attendance. But that's definitely not to say that it's a bad song, not by any means. Originally performed by Yoko Takahashi back in 1995, music has most definitely evolved, but this piece remains a timeless gem. While the timing might seem odd to suddenly release the song on YouTube, and believe me it still is, you'll find that King Records have also released a new physical press of "The Cruel Angel's Thesis," which is available now for 1,000 yen.

13744|2018-06-20|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-dlc/| News | Games | Kingdom Hearts III Will Not Receive Final Mix, Opts for DLC Instead | Square Enix shared that Kingdom Hearts III will not be receiving a final mix like previous games in the series, instead opting for DLC content to build upon the game's story. |For the first time in the long-running Kingdom Hearts franchises history, the Square Enix and Disney crossover title will see a mainline title opt for DLC over a "Final Mix" definitive version of the game. The news comes following a recent interview between Kingdom Hearts III director Tetsuya Nomura and Famitsu magazine, where Nomura had more than a few details to share about the upcoming 2019 title. Let's take a look at the full list of details below: The reason it was delayed a bit outside of its 2018 release is a result of continued adjustments with parties involved. This was not due to needing more development time. The Frozen world takes place during the same time as the movie, and the scene we saw will be developed the same way. It’ll also have “Let It Go.” Anna and Elsa don’t join your party, but Marshmallow will lend his powers. The Pirates of the Caribbean world is set in the third film (At World’s End). Details on the second movie will be available in a synopsis. The Ratatouille part is a mini-game. When you succeed the mini-game, you can create meals that increases your status. You’ll collect cooking ingredients for this across various worlds. The dance scene on the tower in the Tangled world is also a mini-game in the style of a rhythm game. Most of the mini-games were proposed by staff. A secret movie is already in the works, but isn’t finalized yet. Square Enix is preparing something to follow the story of the Kingdom Hearts series. There’s a five-part episode series (available in Japanese) narrated by Chirithy to do just that. These videos have been made available after E3, but Square Enix is considering adding it as part of Kingdom Hearts III. Since Kingdom Hearts III has great volume, there’s the concern that there might not be enough space for it. In order to shorten some of the loading times, Square Enix is working on making some cutscenes into movies, but the volume is much more than expected. On that note, switching between Japanese and English voiceovers has proven difficult. The Final Mix versions that has added content in the past isn’t being considered this time around. There are plans for updates through DLC, so we’ll get new content like that instead of through a Final Mix. As for the DLC, Nomura believes they’ll be in the form of simple downloads rather than the form of a Season Pass. There's a lot to take in here, but perhaps most important is the final two keynotes. Tetsuya Nomura's detailing that Kingdom Hearts III will not be receiving a Final Mix comes in both fully expected and as a bit of a shock at the same time. Furthermore, the announcement that the game will not be seeing a Season Pass is another interesting move, instead opting for individual pieces of downloadable content. Coming in just six months before the game's release on January 29, 2019, we're definitely curious to see what else comes forward. Square Enix's upcoming Kingdom Hearts III is slated to release in Japan on January 27, 2019, and internationally on January 29, 2019. Until that much-awaited date, however, you can check our full archives for further news on the title, here. Source: Siliconera |Kingdom Hearts III, Kingdom Hearts, Square Enix, Kingdom Hearts 3

Creating two of the most iconic tracks of the genre, including "BABY BABYの夢", there's been a demand for more ever since, and we've finally almost got it. But a traditional future funk edit simply wouldn't be enough for TANUKI, instead opting to completely remake the tracks he's working with, and the end result is nothing short of gorgeous. In TANUKI's latest release, "Radiant Memories," stemming from his upcoming Kanji Title EP, the artist sees himself recreating both Mariya Takeuchi's "Plastic Love" and Tatsuro Yamashita's "Sparkle" before mixing them all together into something beautiful. The end result is nothing short of incredible, bringing new life to two of the most iconic songs of the decade. Set to be released in the coming weeks, we most definitely can't wait to see what TANUKI puts together this time with the rest of the EP.

The grin on his face during the entire video says it all, even he knows how ridiculously funny this all is. This one definitely deserves to go in the history books as one of Nintendo's greatest moments and is probably one of the best things to come out of this year's E3 event. It's also worth noting that as a true blue gamer myself, I've already managed to collect all the moons, and can't wait to see what additional content finds its way into the game, as Miyamoto stated. Keep at it Miyamoto, ya ripper legend. |Shigeru Miyamoto, Mario, Nintendo

Unafraid of throwing punches, series creator Bkub Okawa has long been lauded for their hot takes. Never been on the internet before and somehow missed the series entirely? Pop Team Epic is described below: Pop Team Epic turns absurdist comedy up to eleven with its pop culture references and surreal hilarity. With two bonafide high school girl protagonists—the short and exceptionally quick to anger Popuko, and the tall and unshakably calm Pipimi—they throw genres against the wall and don't wait to see what sticks. Parody is interlaced with drama, action, crudeness, and the show's overarching goal—to become a real anime.

Following the announcement just a few short weeks ago of an anime adaptation of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba from ufotable, it couldn't be a better time for VIZ Media to pick up the Weekly Shonen Jump series for English release. Both releases are expected to hit stores across North America from July 3rd. Published via Weekly Shonen Jump since 2016, the VIZ Media release will see publication both digitally and physically via the Shonen Jump imprint. Written and illustrated by author Koyoharu Gotouge, the manga has constantly been a high-performer in Japan. The series was previously given a test-run in VIZ Media's "Jump Start" imprint, but it was not renewed for serialization at the time. Given the recent announcement of an anime adaptation, however, it makes sense that they'd bring this one back. VIZ Media describes the series below: In Taisho-era Japan, Tanjiro Kamado is a kindhearted boy who makes a living selling charcoal. But his peaceful life is shattered when a demon slaughters his entire family. His little sister Nezuko is the only survivor, but she has been transformed into a demon herself! Tanjiro sets out on a dangerous journey to find a way to return his sister to normal and destroy the demon who ruined his life. Following on, the upcoming July 3 release of One Piece Color Walk Compendium: East Blue to Skypiea is a deluxe hardcover book containing a collection of artwork from the One Piece manga series. Long renowned as the worlds most popular manga series, it comes as little surprise that we're seeing even more of Eiichiro Oda's ongoing pirate adventure. VIZ Media describes the release below: Enjoy this gorgeous collection of color artwork from Eiichiro Oda’s ONE PIECE! Filled with color images and special illustrations from the world’s most popular manga series, the compendium features over 300 pages of beautiful color art, several large pull-out posters, and interviews between Eiichiro Oda and other famous manga artists, including Akira Toriyama, the creator of DRAGON BALL. This collection contains both volumes of previously released and now out-of-print COLOR WALK art books as well as COLOR WALK 3, which was never released in English, and covers the early parts of ONE PIECE—from the East Blue arc, where the main characters of the Straw Hat pirates first meet, to the Skypiea arc where Luffy and friends face high-flying adventures!

Straight off of Moodoïd's latest album, "Cité Champagne," the track and its accompanying music video prominently feature Wednesday Campanella member KOM_I as both her and band frontman Pablo Padovani dance around Nakano with their new reptile friend. Released just a week apart from another collaborative track between Moodoïd and Wednesday Campanella, "Matryoshka," you'll find that "Langage" is very much more of a Moodoïd song, whilst the former is very much your traditional Wednesday Campanella song. Both songs feature the same powerful intertwining of both Japanese and French lyrical stylings, however, making for something unlike anything else I've ever heard. It's no secret that Japanese musical group Wednesday Campanella has had their eyes set on a global audience from a while now, something particularly showcased by their numerous international gigs and appearances. What this marks, however, these releases mark the group's first collaborative effort with anybody from outside of their home turf. If this is just the beginning, we can't wait to see where Wednesday Campanella can go from here.|Moodoid, Wednesday Campanella, Suiyoubi no Campanella, langage

Announced via Pokémon GO's official website earlier today, the news comes just weeks after the announcement of both Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon Let's Go, Eevee! on Nintendo Switch, the upcoming companion RPG titles for the smartphone game. Expected to begin rolling out as early as next week, the full package of in-game improvements is expected to come as part of Pokémon GO's Summer update. There's a lot to know about the features and how they work, but perhaps most importantly is the implementation of the friends feature. Once the update goes live, players will find themselves assigned with a new Trainer Code, which can be distributed to up to 200 people as you continue growing as a trainer. From there, players will find themselves able to trade and gift Pokémon to those on their list. There's a catch to all this, however, and that comes in the form of an original trick to trading Pokémon; trainers will need to be within a certain proximity of each other for the trade to go through. In other words, you probably won't be sending Pokémon to your friends overseas anytime soon. Slated to go live during the Summer, trainers have a lot to look forward to in the way of new improvements and long-needed features for the smartphone game. Until the update goes live, however, you can find further information via the game's official website.|Pokemon, Pokemon Go, Niantic

While that expansion has certainly been ongoing, however, it'd be a stretch to say that it's anywhere near accessible to the general public. That's where Taito's latest bit of news comes in with so much excitement -- the announcement that the PC release of Groove Coaster is just around the corner, with a July 17, 2018, release date on Steam. Originally released as an iOS exclusive rhythm game, Groove Coaster burst onto the scene in 2011 as a spin-off title to Taito's massively-popular Space Invaders series. It would only take two years after the release of the iOS version of the game, however, for its full potential to be realized with the release of the arcade variant of the game. Five years later and we're finally seeing things go full circle with another home release of the game, this time for PC via Steam. Taito describes the game below: Riding the rhythmic rails of success from smart phone, into the arcades, now GROOVE COASTER arrives at full Steam! Staying true to its core concept of simplicity of play + exhilarating experience, the Steam version is better than ever, with 36 original tracks included from various game music composers and more on the way. Get ready to ride a roller coaster of sound and light through a universe of music! The game is currently set to be compatible with both keyboards and controllers, as well as allowing players to utilize three different aspect ratios and layouts that will include a more arcade-traditional vertical monitor layout. Additionally, while the game has been noted to include a total of 36 original tracks, its unknown if any tie-in tracks will become available, such as those with idol group Dempagumi.inc. Set to release July 17 on Steam, further information on the upcoming home release can be found via the game's official website.|Rhythm Coaster, Steam, PC, Taito, Rhythm Coaster PC, Steam Rhythm Games

We've seen a few days of rumors and leaks, but following the most recent episode of DARLING in the FRANXX it was finally confirmed, Studio TRIGGER is teaming up with Arc System Works to craft their latest video game venture, Kill la Kill the Game IF. But following that confirmation, that was about all we got. Let's talk about that, however: Announced via a brief commercial at the end of DARLING in the FRANXX most recent episode, Kill la Kill the Game IF is shrouded in a thin veil of mystery, outside of the fact it's a fighting game, of course. The commercial didn't do much in the way of a preview, either, mostly filled with clips from the original anime series and a brief announcement that the game would be coming out sometime in 2019. It won't be until you visit the game's official website that you start to see something from the game, either. Developed by the team at APLUS, the same individuals behind Little Witch Academia Chamber of Time which recently released in the West, the game is set to be published by Arc System Works. Listed as a 1-2 player "KLK Battle Action" title, it is yet to be revealed what platforms the game will be available on, and at what price. While there's most definitely a whole world of questions to be asked about just what we can expect from the upcoming fighting game, you can rest assured knowing that the staff of the game will be making an appearance at Anime Expo 2018. With that being said, you can definitely expect a few more details at the event. Until then, however, be sure to check out the game's official website for further details, and we'll be sure to keep you updated on any announcements.|Trigger, Kill la Kill, Arc System Works, Kill la Kill the Game IF

Additionally, the trailer also gave us our first look at the film's theme song "Long Hope Philia" which is being performed by Masaki Suda and written and composed by amazarashi member Hiromu Akita. The trailer comes just weeks ahead of the film's world premiere at Anime Expo 2018: The first cinematic entry into the ever-developing My Hero Academia universe, My Hero Academia: Two Heroes sees both Deku and All Might face new and exciting challenges in unexpected places. Written and created by the same person who penned the original My Hero Academia story, we're left with a seriously promising story for fans of the ongoing series. North American publisher Funimation describes the upcoming film below: The climactic finals are over, and U.A. is getting ready for the summer training camp. Deku and All Might receive an invitation from a certain person to go overseas to a giant artificial moving city called I-Island. This island, a kind of “science Hollywood” that gathers the knowledge of scientists from around the world, is holding an exhibition called I-Expo showcasing the results of Quirk and hero item research. In the midst of all this, Deku meets a Quirkless girl named Melissa and remembers his own Quirkless past. Out of the blue, the impregnable security system the island boasts is hacked by villains, and all the people on the island are taken as hostages! Now, a plan that could shake hero society has been put into motion! The man who holds the key to it all is the number one hero and Symbol of Peace, All Might. Set to release in Japan on August 3, 2018, following the world premiere event at Anime Expo 2018 hosted by Funimation and TOHO on July 5, the film is slated for a later release in North America.

The Japanese boy band - who originally formed in 1996 - have found themselves as viral hitmakers with their latest single "U.S.A." which dropped in the past month via their official YouTube channel. It should certainly go without saying for anyone who watched the music video just as to why the group is going viral with this one; combining an overwhelming amount of patriotism with an irresistible beat isn't something you come by too often. On top of that, we've gotta be honest -- if there was ever a label to associate with when releasing a Eurobeat banger, it most definitely would have to be Avex. While the label is certainly known for a lot of things, one of the greatest parts of their history and present is the long-running Super Eurobeat series which spans over 249 CDs at the time of writing. The song is a whole bunch of fun from start to finish, and I'm sure for the more contemporaries it's pretty damn easy to see yourself drifting down the American equivalent to Mt. Akina to this tune.

It's no industry secret that Japan is home to some of the most fashion-conscious minds, and Anime Expo's latest movement aims to bring that consciousness to their long-running convention in the form of their first-ever lookbook. There's a finite art to pulling off some of your favorite anime merchandise, and while confidence in your overall outfit is the most important step, there is certainly a level of coordination that needs to come with it. What Anime Expo is aiming to do with their lookbook is to introduce a small sample of fun ways you can pull off your favorite merch, starting with their own personal branded gear, of course. There are a few things to note with the convention's first-ever lookbook, and it all starts with clean design: Anime Expo has been making leaps and bounds over the years to present some of the cleanest merchandise in the convention scene, something that particularly piqued my interest last year when they collaborated with Tokyo-based fashion brand Galaxxxy. Let's be real, can we talk about how clean the MAX Jacket is from this year's collection? Chuck that piece on and that's basically all the coordination you'll ever need. I'm very down with that piece in particular, that's for sure. Spread out across a total of 20-pages, Anime Expo 2018 invites people from all walks of life to celebrate the worlds of Japanese pop culture and self-expression. Taking place from July 5 - July 8 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, you can catch our full coverage of the convention in our comprehensive archives, here.

The announcement came on June 14th via the series’ official website, and the staff shared the following comment: When we set down to discuss the members’ various aspirations for the future, as a result of much consultation, we found that the best way to achieve these dreams would be for us to go our separate ways. It, therefore, seems like the decision hasn’t been forced on the members or staff from above, but has come about as a result of careful consideration of how the group will proceed in the future. Furthermore, the aspirations for the future that the members of the group had been seemingly not congruent with the WUG project, so the only option was to disband the current cast - a hard decision, but one that will hopefully lead to some new, exciting ventures. Although what kind of things the members will be doing post-disbanding does certainly pique my interest, it is a shame that they weren’t able to reconcile their dreams with the WUG project. After all, the series has been around for a long time now - since 2011 - and to see such an industry veteran bow out is always a shame. That being said, they aren’t going out with a whimper, as a final tour for 2019 has been announced, which will give fans one last time with the current cast. It’s important, however, to keep in mind the fact that only the current cast will be disbanded and the project itself will continue onwards - meaning that we could get more WUG in the future if new cast members are found. Furthermore, the current cast’s careers will still continue, particularly in the voice acting industry where they have made a big name for themselves. That being said, I can’t help but wonder if the changing landscape of virtual idols has had a hand in this sudden decision. Along with Macross, WUG has always been considered a big player in the virtual idol industry and sometimes a close rival of industry giants The iDOLM@STER and Love Live!. But that status quo has been changing rapidly ever since the meteoric success of the BanG Dream! franchise, which may have pushed both sales and enthusiasm for WUG down to an all-time low. Even so, we wish the cast and staff of WUG all the best for the future, no matter where they end up. The eight years fans have spent with the project will surely stand the test of time.

The most notable games in the cases were both Monster Hunter: World and Splatoon 2, marking the first time in Japanese history that arrests have been made for such offenses. During the raids on the bars across the two cities, police confiscated roughly 30 game consoles and a total 1,100 games across all of the bars. Its believed that one of the bars which were raided was making more than $13,500 a month from operations, where the main purpose of the bar was for gaming. It's reported that the arrests were followed through on after warnings were issued by the Association of Copyright for Computer Software to bars across Japan earlier this year. This was following criminal complaints from companies such as Nintendo, many of which were directed toward such bars. The news likely comes as a shock to smaller establishments across the country, especially those with gaming devices installed to entertain customers during their stay. It currently remains to be seen as to whether or not further arrests will be made, or if the ACCS was simply using these three individuals to set an example. While it's uncertain what will happen to those currently under arrest for the copyright violations, we'll be sure to keep you up-to-date.

This follows closely after the author’s comment on the sleeve of the latest issue of One Piece which contained some particularly problematic content regarding the Pacific War. Oda’s comment for the volume read as follows: When you’re eating, there’s always that one piece of fried chicken left on the plate, right? We gave that a name - Sergeant Yakoi. ‘Sergeant Yakoi’s still there! Someone make this war end!’ ...or something like that. The ‘Sergeant Yakoi’ mentioned refers to no other than the famous ex-lieutenant Yakoi Shouichi, who lived in the jungle of Guam for 28 years without knowing that the Pacific War had ended before being found in 1972 and returning home to become a media sensation. Such a strange reference was only further brought into focus when the editorial team attached a picture of Yokoi saluting above the comment. Considering that the Pacific War has always been, and even is today, a very controversial issue in Japan, with many ideological camps determining how Japanese people view the war, it’s no surprise that both Oda’s comment and the editorial team’s picture drew controversy. Many spoke out against it on the grounds that it was “disrespectful” and “trivialized” the casualties, and even if you don't view the comment as particularly controversial, you can hardly say it was a joke made in good taste. In the wake of such backlash, the editorial team posted a statement today on the official Shueisha website stating that “We, together with the author, are deeply regretful for our actions” and that “We will try to keep in mind less controversial things going forward.” They announced no plans to change or alter the comment on the volume, however. That being said, it doesn’t seem very fair that the editorial team has to face the majority of the criticism while Oda himself stays quiet. The team’s decision to attach a photograph of Yokoi certainly made the joke less subtle than it could’ve been, but I can’t help but wonder what was going through Oda’s mind when he decided to put his tasteless joke in the volume in the first place. Such a comment hardly feels at home in a manga such as One Piece, which has always been a family-friendly series intended for entertainment - not anything to do with the Pacific War.|One piece, Eiichiro Oda, Weekly Shonen Jump

Tower Records Café branches in Harajuku, Sapporo, and Umeda, Osaka will all host the event, allowing fans all across the country to take part. And what an event this is shaping up to be. Not one, but two menus will be available over the café’s run, offering fans loads of choice. The first week of each café’s run will be serving up the first menu, and then the second and third weeks will be serving up the second menu. Only dishes from the first menu have been revealed so far, from the sugary ‘Ochaco and Tsuyu’s Sweetie Set’ to the hearty ‘All Might Burger,’ so keep an eye out for more information. All of the dishes are themed closely after each character, and I’m sure that fans won’t be disappointed by their favorite character’s dishes. Furthermore, which menu you order from will also affect what exclusive postcard and sticker you get, as there are two different pools from which they are selected at random. The first week’s selection is themed after the heroes, and the second after the villains, so make sure to check the details beforehand. Tower Records are also offering an exclusive range of limited goods for fans to both reserve and buy in store - everything from can badges, to a mobile battery, to even a clock - but the best of the bunch has to be this subtle yet stylish All Might-themed travel mug. I can almost imagine All Might using it himself in the staffroom at UA! You don’t need a reservation to visit a Tower Records Café either, so if you’re in the area there’s no excuse not to go and check out what is shaping up to be a great collaboration. The Harajuku store will commence the event on July 3, and the Sapporo and Umeda store will commence on July 10.

13700|2018-06-14|14:00||http://otaquest.com/akagi-tokyo-takeover/| News | Manga | ‘Akagi’ Takes Over Tokyo to Celebrate Finale After 27 Years | After 27 long years and 36 nerve-wracking volumes later, Nobuyuki Fukumoto’s legendary gambling manga Akagi has come to an end. |After 27 long years and 36 nerve-wracking volumes later, Nobuyuki Fukumoto’s legendary gambling manga Akagi has come to an end. Even among his other excellent works such as Kaiji and Ten, Akagi is not just his longest series, but his most fully realized yet - it stands to reason, then, that the author is honored for such a feat. The final, 36th volume of the series will release on June 27, and to celebrate the end of the series anime goods chain Animate will be conducting a signing event with the mangaka himself - allowing fans a rare chance to meet and talk with the otherwise elusive, workaholic Fukumoto. The first signing event will take place at Animate Ikebukuro building no. 2 on July 1, and the second will take place at Animate Akihabara on July 28. Since no other venues have been announced, it’s probably safe to say that these dates will be your only chance. That being said, you do need to have either bought or placed a reservation for both Akagi volume 36 and a special commemorative acrylic plate set to take part in the signing event. The final volume will set you back around 700 yen, but no details have yet been shared as to the design or price of the acrylic plate. Even so, this seems like a rather small price to pay for such a rare opportunity. Make sure to register to take part at either of the participating stores, however, as only limited spaces are available on a first come, first serve basis. With all that being said, you can join in with the Akagi celebrations without having to spend a single yen - simply make your way over to the Takeshobo buildings in Tokyo and Iiidabashi to take a look at a special display on the windows of the ground floor. It looks a little something like this: To celebrate the ending of the manga, publisher Takeshobo gathered over 200 pieces of fanart which show off different aspects of the series and its world. The best of the bunch have been used to make this display at the Takeshobo offices, and it’s certainly something to behold. Just seeing the different styles and approaches to the series really reinforces how impactful it has been over its long run - something both Takeshobo and Fukumoto should rightfully celebrate. You can also check out all of the fanart online via Akagi's official website. Nobuyuki Fukumoto’s Akagi follows the titular Shigeru Akagi as he returns to the world of mahjong after defeating high ranking yakuza at the mere age of thirteen. Similar to the well-known Kaiji, the series explores the game of mahjong as well as the psychological states of the players in the great detail that Fukumoto has become famous for - with plenty of ‘zawa zawa,’ of course.|Akagi, Nobuyuki Fukumoto, Animate

13690|2018-06-13|16:00||http://otaquest.com/yakuza-pc-fist-north-star-sega/| News | Games | Sega Announce ‘Yakuza’ on PC, English Release of ‘Fist of the North Star’ Spinoff | SEGA took to the stage to announce today that both Yakuza 0 and Kiwami will be coming to PC via Steam, making for a first in the franchise’s history. |Last year was already a great one for fans of SEGA’s long-running Yakuza series; being treated to not one, but two installments in the franchise - the prequel Yakuza 0 and a remake of the first game, Yakuza Kiwami. We barely had time to catch our breath before the English release of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life came in early 2018, either. But I hope you still have an appetite for the Japanese gangland beat-‘em-up series, as SEGA had some pretty surprising news to share during this year’s PC Gaming Show at E3. Namely, that both Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami will be coming to PC via Steam, making for a first in the franchise’s history. Steam pages for both titles were subsequently uploaded after the reveal, allowing us to find out more information and pre-order. The PC versions of each game will feature 4K resolutions and uncapped framerates, but it doesn’t look like any gameplay changes are planned - making this perfect for those who want to get into the series, but not exactly a must-buy for established fans. The surprise announcement represents SEGA’s ongoing effort to make some of it’s best titles of recent years available on PC, which was signaled by last year’s PC releases of both Bayonetta and Vanquish. Such a move can only be positive for these franchises, as it allows greater numbers of people to experience the excellent experiences that these games offer. Yakuza has also been limited in terms of it’s reach both due to its Japan-only releases as well as always being console exclusives, so perhaps this series will finally get the recognition it has always deserved worldwide. SEGA also announced that the Yakuza-style Fist of the North Star spinoff game will be coming to the west, under the title of ‘Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise.’ Check out the reveal trailer below: Fist of the North Star is a series that I’m sure needs no introduction, due to its pervasive place in Japanese popular culture. Even so, for the equally legendary Yakuza series to cross over with another legendary series of it’s own calibre seemed like a dream come true when it released in Japan last year, and now western fans will also get to experience this truly legendary crossover as you play as Kenshiro in an alternate version of the events of the original manga, all the while duking it out with bad guys using Yakuza’s trademark fighting system. However, it did come as a bit of a surprise for SEGA not only to release the game in the West but also to give it a full English dub. This can especially be said considering that the series isn’t as well-known overseas as it is in Japan. No doubt they are encouraged by the success of recent Yakuza titles in the west and hope that fans will support this release in turn, even if they have no knowledge of the manga. There’s no news on porting Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise to PC just yet, but I’m sure that if it does well, SEGA will consider it. All in all, it seems like this year will be another good year for Yakuza fans, who surely haven’t finished up the hundred-hour Yakuza 6 since it’s release merely 2 months ago. And I haven’t even finished Kiwami yet!|Yakuza, Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, Sega, E3

Best known for his work on the series, the creator spent curious amounts of time dabbling in the many aspects of art which would eventually involve him in SNES titles such as DoReMi Fantasy: Milon’s DokiDoki Adventure, as well as anime such as Beyblade. It was before Mizuno's time with Hudson Soft that Bomberman sported a much more rounded design, with his design defining the Bomberman many of us have come to know and love today. Following the passing of Shinji Mizuno, we saw a public outcry of messages thanking him for his contributions to the lives of so many. One such person includes fellow former Hudson Soft employee Toshiyuki Takahashi who memorialized Mizuno's contributions to Hudson Soft as a company. While further information is yet to be revealed surrounding the circumstances of his passing, we share our thoughts with all of his friends and family.|Shoji Mizuno, Bomberman, Hudson Soft
13678|2018-06-12|17:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/super-smash-bros-ultimate/| News | Games | 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate' Lives Up to Its Name, Launch Date Revealed | The Ultimate version of one of the world's most popular competitive games will launch this year on the Nintendo Switch. |For those of us going into the annual E3 event, few would have predicted the direction that the new Super Smash Bros. entry has been revealed to take. The Nintendo Switch release, which is aptly titled Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, brings back every single legacy character, multiple familiar stages, and mixes all of that in with a lot of new, original content. It truly does live up to its moniker. Let's peek that twenty-five minute-long trailer and character showcase below: By far the biggest selling point for the game is that "Everyone Is Here," and yes, that does mean the Ice Climbers are back. Even Snake, whom everyone thought would be eternally stuck in some sort of licensing hell is making his triumphant return, and will be voiced by David Hayter to boot! In addition to the legacy characters, Ultimate is adding Splatoon's Inklings, Daisy from the Mario franchise, and an oft-requested beast for over twelve years now -- Ridley, from the Metroid franchise. Not too big now, huh? Expect some important game mechanic mixups, like shortened Final Smashes, and easier to execute short jumps. For the latter, players simply have to press the A button at the same time as they execute their jump, making it easier to perform air attacks on players close to the ground. The ability to air dash is also making a return; something that has not been around since the Melee days. Additionally, the stage select screen now comes before the character select screen, so that you don't get left out in the cold with a mismatched fighter choice. Though, if you are really worried about stage imbalance, take solace in the fact that every single stage will allow the ability to switch to a standard battlefield version (consisting of one long base platform and 3 additional smaller platforms) or to a Final Destination version (one long platform). Mr. Sakurai is going all-out to make sure that this entry into the venerated series will be the only one you ever need, and I'm so happy that he's taking much better care of himself this time around. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will launch for the Nintendo Switch on December 7. Isn't that boxart gorgeous? It's the very same as the game's key art, which can be seen in the article's header image.|Gaming, Video Games, e3 2018, Super Smash Bros., Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Nintendo
13680|2018-06-12|15:00||http://otaquest.com/fromsoftware-e3-2018-announcements/| News | Games | From Software Unveils VR Game, New IP ‘Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice’ | The remake Metal Wolf Chaos XD wasn’t the only thing that Souls developer FromSoftware had to show at this year’s E3 - with two new titles announced for both Xbox One and PlayStation 4. |The remake Metal Wolf Chaos XD wasn’t the only thing that legendary Souls developer From Software had to show at this year’s E3 - not only was a new VR game from the studio revealed, but the Microsoft conference saw the long-awaited reveal of the studio’s new original IP with a trailer that revealed the game’s name, setting, some basic gameplay and some story details. Check it out below: Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice takes place in the Warring States era of Japan and features yet another scorned protagonist - this time named ‘Sekiro,’ whose name means ‘the wolf torn in half,’ alluding to both his artificial arm and his tragic backstory; torn away from his young master by his archenemy, he must go on a quest to reclaim his ‘other half,’ slaying plenty of baddies on the way. How he’ll achieve that goal seems rather different from other entries in FromSoftware’s library, however, as Sekiro will use his artificial arm not only to deploy some unique weapons but also as a grappling hook - adding an element of verticality to the studio’s games that hasn’t been explored before. Furthermore, the lack of shields and dashing in the trailer seem to suggest that, unlike Dark Souls and Bloodborne, Sekiro will be focused more on swordplay, most likely rendering parrying and countering even more essential than ever before. The game is slated to release in 2019, and considering that most games from the studio have been released around March, it’s safe to assume that it’ll be in the first half of 2019 at least. As usual, From Software and director Miyazaki have stayed light on details so far, so all that remains is to wait patiently for more information as best we can. Another rumor finally proven true is that FromSoftware is working on a PlayStation VR game, which was revealed in the after-show of Sony’s E3 conference. While it does seem a bit of a disservice to relegate such a beloved studio’s game to after the main conference, a trailer did help with our curiosity: Titled Déraciné and available exclusively for PlayStation VR, you play as a ghost who inhabits a school. Through player interaction, puzzles and a ‘mysterious story,’ you will have to prove your existence to the children who do not believe in you. It looks to be completely different from the studio’s past work since it seems to be in the first person as well as not having a focus on combat. Even so, no doubt there is more than meets the eye with this title, as FromSoftware never simply develops a genre game, always taking a unique direction - I mean, who expected Bloodborne to really be about Lovecraftian horror? Speaking of Bloodborne, the studio’s last PlayStation-exclusive title, looking on the website reveals that Déraciné will be developed using the same engine as Bloodborne, meaning that all of the great technology developed to make Bloodborne as great as it was thankfully won’t be going to waste after all. Déraciné will release in 2018, so looks like we won’t have to wait long before we can uncover what this game is really about. That being said, the real star of the show here definitely has to be Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which looks to be pushing forward the Souls formula in new, exciting ways with its new combat style and vertical level design. Of course, let’s not forget the remake of the glorious cult classic Metal Wolf Chaos announced during the Devolver Digital conference as well. This year From Software definitely put forward a strong showing, and there’s still plenty more to come from this year’s conferences.|, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Sekiro, FromSoftware, From Software

13679|2018-06-12|14:00||http://otaquest.com/death-stranding-e3-2018-trailer/| News | Games | Toenails, Ghosts and Mailmen in the New ‘Death Stranding’ E3 2018 Trailer | It’s been almost two years since the first reveal trailer for Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding, and this year we finally received some answers as to just what's going on with his now-annual appearance at the Sony E3 conference. |It’s been almost two years since the first reveal trailer for Hideo Kojima’s post-Metal Gear crackpot project Death Stranding, and although there are still thousands upon thousands of unanswered questions surrounding the game, Kojima finally gave us some answers this year with his now-annual appearance at the Sony E3 conference. Check out the trailer below: Just looking at the description of the video gives an answer to one of the most burning questions - what actually is ‘Death Stranding’? Turns out that, rather predictably, it refers to the event that destroyed the world (the so-called ‘third bang’ in last year’s trailer), and also most likely to the mysterious enemies in the game. These enemies appeared once more in this year’s trailer, not only attacking Reedus’ character but also being avoided by Reedus in what looks like to be some stealth gameplay. The mysterious contraption on Reedus’ back, which is powered by a baby, also seems to help Reedus see the enemies in the form of black ghosts, but only temporarily. Furthermore, a new female character tells us that these ghosts fast forward time when they touch you, which is then shown when Reedus is noticed by the ghosts and attacked by them. It seems, therefore, that this game will be playing heavily with the concept of time and time travel - hopefully allowing Kojima to present some truly unique gameplay experiences. We already got a lot of information surrounding Norman Reedus’ character last year, most importantly his name - Sam Porter - so it’s only right that Kojima focuses on another character this time around. Kojima has been hunting for an actress for a female protagonist for a while now, and the rumors seemed to converge on Emma Stone for a while, but this trailer shows that the two Hollywood stars Léa Seydoux and Lindsay Wagner will be joining the cast alongside the already confirmed Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen. Seydoux seems to be playing a character similar to Sam, giving him advice about how to survive in the world; whereas Wagner seems to be playing someone from Sam’s past, as she appears at the end of the trailer with the line ‘You don’t who I am.’ With the cast for his game bolstered, hopefully, this means that Kojima can ramp up development so we can see a demo soon, possibly at next year’s E3, but that didn’t stop some glimpses of what looks to be gameplay appearing in this year’s trailer. The core gameplay seems to revolve around ‘deliveries,’ with Sam stating that ‘I make deliveries… that’s all’ and Seydoux’s character referring to Sam as ‘the man who delivers.’ Various shots of Sam walking through landscapes with different things on his back - even a body bag at one point - also seems to confirm this. We won’t just be walking, however, as we see Sam scaling up a mountain using a rope and then performing self-surgery by pulling off a toenail. This reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 3’s survival system, and this could indicate that Kojima will be incorporating a similar gameplay mechanic this time around. Also returning from Metal Gear Solid V might be an open-world gameplay structure, as evidenced by the open landscapes and the different traversal methods showcased. We don’t have a release date for Death Stranding just yet, but judging from the glimpses of gameplay footage in the trailer as well as the general concept for the gameplay now being confirmed, I think it’s a safe bet to assume that we’ll see a playable demo at next year’s E3. Of course, before that we have The Game Awards this December, which Kojima debuted a new trailer at last year thanks to his close friendship with Geoff Keighley, so we might not have to wait all that long for more information. That being said, I wouldn’t expect full disclosure just yet - this is a Hideo Kojima game, after all.|Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima, Norman Reedus, Playstation, sony, Kojima Productions

13674|2018-06-11|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/devolver-metal-wolf-chaos-announce/| News | Games | Devolver Digital Announce 'Metal Wolf Chaos XD', HD Remake of Original Title | Just a few short days ago we shared speculation of something 'new' in the Metal Wolf Chaos universe, and today Devolver Digital revealed an English remaster of the original game. |It was just a few days ago that we were speculating game publisher Devolver Digital's involvement in something related to FromSoftware's cult-classic Xbox title Metal Wolf Chaos following a simple teaser posted to their Twitter. Well turns out we were right, with the company today announcing a full-HD remaster of the game titled Metal Wolf Chaos XD, marking the franchise's first time making it out of Japan. Made possible in parts because of both Digital Devolver and General Arcade, the title is slated for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam. The game looks, well, as ridiculous as I remember it to be; with all the cheesy lines hitting just as hard as they should. I'm sure the game is going to look great with 4k support and widescreen format support too. Oh, and did I mention the game is getting improved controls and an all-new save system to boot? Metal Wolf Chaos XD is described by Digital Devolver below: The country is in peril as President Michael Wilson defends the nation against a full-scale rebellion lead by Vice-President Richard Hawk and the mechanized legions he commands. As the 47th President of the United States, it is your sworn duty to take your country back by any means necessary and end this unjust coup d'etat! Battle in your advanced mech - armed to the teeth - across iconic American landscapes including the Brooklyn Bridge, the Grand Canyon, and the front steps of the White House. When the game was first released in December 2004 it was met with its fair share of problems that made it pretty damn inaccessible. For one, the title was Japan-exclusive and available only on the original Xbox. With how few Xbox units there were floating around in Japan, a staggering estimated 450,000 units by 2011, the player base simply wasn't there in its home country. With that being said, the game steadily developed a cult-like following internationally over the years, with many falling in love with its ridiculously patriotic story and theme. In releasing the game internationally in an updated format, Devolver Digital is finally allowing a new generation to experience the greatness that preceded FromSoftware's other greats such as the more familiar Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Set to release at some point during 2018, further information on the game can be found via its official website.|Devolver Digital, Metal Wolf Chaos, From Software, Metal Wolf Chaos XD, Metal Wolf, General Arcade, FromSoftware
13673|2018-06-11|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/shonen-jump-jump-force-announce/| News | Anime , Manga , Games | Weekly Shonen Jump Crossover Fighting Game ‘Jump Force’ Announced | There are lots of surprise announcements every year at E3, and but one of the many so far this year was the new fighting game featuring characters from Weekly Shonen Jump, titled Jump Force. |There are lots of surprise announcements every year at E3, and but one of the many so far this year was the new fighting game featuring characters from Weekly Shonen Jump, titled Jump Force. Bandai Namco Entertainment debuted the above trailer during the Microsoft conference, and it shows off the basic premise of the game - that the universes of various Jump properties have collided - as well showing off some key characters in action. We got to see Goku, Luffy, and Naruto all duke it out against Frieza in both pre-rendered cinematics and what looks like to be some in-engine gameplay footage. The end of the trailer left us with a sting of Light Yagami and Ryuk watching over the battle - teasing their involvement in turn. Concrete details wouldn’t be shared until a little later in the above interview conducted by IGN with the game’s producer Koji Nakajima, however, who has worked on various Dragonball and One Piece games in the past. Nakajima first confirmed that the project is, in fact, part of the ongoing Jump 50th-anniversary celebrations, and what better way to celebrate Jump’s long history than letting it’s characters beat the living daylights out of each other? When pressed for details on playable characters, however, Nakajima was noticeably more tight-lipped. He refused to confirm how far back the game will be going into Jump’s long history to make its character roster and whether or not characters from series such as Yu Yu Hakusho or My Hero Academia will be making an appearance, only informing us that more announcements will be coming in the future. One such announcement, in fact, appeared on Twitter not much later, via a screenshot that featured Zoro and Sasuke from One Piece and Naruto respectively. That being said, Nakajima did let it slip that the roster will be more focused on ‘hero’ characters than others, laughing off the idea that Prince of Tennis and Food Wars! characters could be fighting alongside Goku et al. Although it’s a shame that we won’t get to see some usually pacifistic characters duke it out, as the Light Yagami sting suggests, they will perhaps be involved in the game through its story - so there’s hope yet for Emma from The Promised Neverland. As for the story, it will take place on modern-day Earth and will feature well-known places such as New York as stages. Nakajima promised that there will be a ‘comprehensive’ story mode alongside the gameplay, perhaps explaining why the universes have collided and the various interactions between the equally varied cast. Furthermore, Nakajima stated that there will be a main villain that all characters will fight against. Whether that will be a Jump character or an original character remains to be seen, but there’s definitely a few strong contenders - Ajimu Najimi, anyone? Gameplay-wise, the game will be less like the 2.5D fighter Dragon Ball FighterZ than a ‘3 on 3 action fighting game,’ meaning that FighterZ’s popularity probably isn’t at risk after not even five months. In addition, environments will be destructible, letting us see the true power of these mighty heroes reflected in the stages itself. Even so, Nakajima admitted that trying to balance all the characters to the same base power level is something the team is laboring over - a task that requires both creativity and ruthlessness, I’d imagine. Development hasn’t yet finished core gameplay development, so don’t expect to play the new crossover fighter anytime soon. That being said, there’s certainly a lot to look forward, and Nakajima teased that it won’t be long before they have more announcements, so stay tuned.|Jump Force, Shonen Jump, Weekly Shonen Jump, One piece, Naruto, Dragon Ball, Death Note

Dropped on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube earlier today, the track runs for a little under three minutes and slaps from start to finish. Best known for her single "Anarchy" that dropped back in November 2017, this marks Jvcki Wai's first release in Japan. Utilizing Jvcki Wai's scattered vocal range over the top of PARKGOLF's frantic electronic beat, "xaradise" we're met with the fusion of Korea's underground hip-hop scene and Japan's constantly evolving electronic scene. There was something about the blend's end result that left me a little off-put at first, though giving it a second listen through followed by everything after that's got me hooked. Lyrically its nothing new, internet-age flow about popping Xanax, etc. But there's something to be said about the overall delivery that definitely gives this track enough pull to deserve a place in your playlist. Available now on iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, and most digital services, further information about the track can be found via Lute Media's official website. You can follow PARKGOLF on Twitter, and Jvcki Wai on Instagram.|
13671|2018-06-11|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/devil-may-cry-5-announced/| News | Games | Devil May Cry 5 Announced for PC, PS4, Xbox One | Devil May Cry 5 is slashing its way onto PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam in Spring 2019 as announced at E3 2018. |Announced earlier today during Microsoft's E3 presentation, Capcom's hyper-stylized action franchise Devil May Cry is getting an all-new entry in Spring 2019 on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam. Aptly titled Devil May Cry 5, the game finds its footing several years proceeding the events of Devil May Cry 4 which released over 10 years ago back in 2008. Directed by Hideaki Itsuno and featuring character designs from Tatsuya Yoshikawa, the game will be running on the RE Engine, the same engine that was used to power Resident Evil 7 just last year. In traditional fashion, Devil May Cry 5's first trailer highlights its over-the-top action sequences and signature flare it has been developing since 2001. The game looks smooth, really smooth; something Microsoft wasn't going to just brush over. The game is set to be the next "true" sequel in the franchise since the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008. Additionally, game director Hideaki Itsuno would go on to detail that this is the best feeling action game Capcom has ever developed, something you'd most definitely be looking for in a game of this speed. "Years have passed since the legions of hell have set foot in this world, but now a new demonic invasion has begun, and humanity's last hope will rest in the hands of three lone demon hunters, each offering a radically different play style. United by fate and a thirst for vengeance, these demon hunters will have to face their demons if they hope to survive. The devil you know returns in the most over the top, technically advanced, utterly insane action experience of this generation." Developed in-house by the team at Capcom, there's certainly a lot of things that could go very right with this one. While the trailer primarily focused on Nero, the protagonist of Devil May Cry 4, it's in the last few seconds of the trailer that we get that glimpse of Dante speeding through the city remains on his motorbike. Set to release in Spring 2019, further information can be found via the game's official website.|E3, Devil May Cry 5, Devil May Cry, Capcom, Hideaki Itsuno, Tatsuya Yoshikawa

Set to the tune of Disney's smash-hit animated film Frozen, and overlayed with Hikaru Utada's gorgeous theme "Don't Think Twice," the new trailer announces a January 29, 2019 release date for the highly-anticipated game. Opening the trailer on a high note, we see Sora, Donald, and Goofy venture through the world of Frozen before later making their way into various other Disney properties such as Wreck it Ralph, Hercules, Toy Story, and more. We're introduced to the moral compass of this story arc, a troubled Elsa who sees her magical abilities as only a tool of destruction rather than something for good. It also highlights a number of Sora's new Keyblade transformations as he battles it out against a number of Heartless. While I truly never thought I'd be saying it, we're fairly confident that not only will this be the final release date for the game, but also that it actually will be coming out during this console generation. Originally announced five years ago during E3 2013, it's been a long wait for even the most dedicated fans, but it's finally almost over. Running for just over three minutes, it's near-impossible for me to find fault with the latest trailer. Coming in with an ambush of childhood nostalgia mixed with modern-gaming expectations, let's just say I'm pretty excited for this one to finally hit the shelves. We're finally on the final stretch leading up to the release of Kingdom Hearts III and excitement couldn't possibly be higher. We'll be sure to keep you up to date as new and exciting information is revealed. Those interested in checking out further information on the upcoming title should head over to the series' official website. |Kingdom Hearts III, Kingdom Hearts 3, Kingdom Hearts, Square Enix, Frozen
13664|2018-06-08|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/metal-wolf-chaos-devolver-digital-e3/| News | Games | Could Devolver Digital Be Teasing Something to Do With Metal Wolf Chaos? | A recent tweet from game publisher Devolver Digital suggests E3 2018 might just get a little patriotic with a new announcement regarding From Software's classic Metal Wolf Chaos. |While the vast majority would be quick to associate Japanese game developers FromSoftware with the likes of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, the studio's history wasn't always so characterized by gloom and rage-quitting. Jump back a full five years before the release of their major breakthrough Demon Souls and you're met with a radically different company; one which was characterized primarily by its willingness to break the boundaries of even the most contemporary video games. Perhaps most notable out of all this is FromSoftware's legendary 2004 Xbox exclusive, Metal Wolf Chaos, and moreover the fact that Devolver Digital is teasing its return. pic.twitter.com/Y0ZzYwnUnV — Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) 8 June 2018 Originally released as an Xbox exclusive that never made it outside of Japan, the market for FromSoftware's title was certainly slim. It wouldn't be until over 12 years later in early 2016 that we'd see a new spark of interest in the title following a tweet made from the official Devolver Digital Twitter account stating “Count us in to help Metal Wolf Chaos get out to more gamers if From Software wants some help.” Two years later and we're possibly seeing the fruits of Devolver Digital's labor via our first teaser tweet, though we're not quite sure what we're in for just yet. It'd be a fair assumption to guess we'll be seeing plenty to do with Metal Wolf Chaos at E3 2018 during Devolver Digital's press conference on June 10, though again we're not sure what it'll entail. Could we be seeing a remake of the original 2004 game on modern consoles? Or even a fully fledged sequel that breaks its way out of Xbox exclusivity allowing for a new type of audience? While we won't be waiting long to find out the answers to these questions, you can bet I'll be waiting on the edge of my seat to see what they have to say. We'll be sure to keep you updated as any new information is revealed.|Devolver Digital, From Software, Metal Wolf Chaos

While the creator is known for more than just a shortlist of genre-defining titles, he'll specifically be tying himself to his work Cutie Honey with the "CUTIE HONEY UNIVERSE – Special Panel with Go Nagai" that he will be hosting on July 7 at Anime Expo. Whether you know him as the godfather of the giant robot genre, the genius mind behind series such as Devilman, or even the madman who gave us a story like Cutie Honey all the way back in 1973, Go Nagai's mark on the industry at large is totally undeniable. With that being said, while he's not exactly a newbie to the industry, chances are the general Western populous didn't truly know about him until the release of the Netflix original Devilman crybaby earlier this year, an excellent adaptation of his original 1972 manga series by Masaaki Yuasa. While that's totally understandable, it's well overdue that Go Nagai is given a full audience to hear what the legend has to say, and where better than Anime Expo 2018? Taking place at the JW Marriott\Live Programming 2 (Platinum Ballroom) panel area on July 7, "CUTIE HONEY UNIVERSE – Special Panel with Go Nagai" will invite fans of the legendary creator to talk about all things Cutie Honey Universe. Additionally, he'll also be participating in a special autograph session, as well as offering objects to the Anime Expo Charity Auction.

Following the unveiling of a number of racist tweets from series creator MINE during a three-year time span between 2012 - 2015, an upcoming TV anime adaptation of the series slated for Fall 2018 has been canned, with almost all staff involved actively walking away from the project entirely. While the tweets have since been deleted from MINE's Twitter account, it's well documented that he would frequently tweet derogatory comments towards Chinese and South Korean citizens. Additionally, content within the story also would mirror the creator's hateful mindset at times, especially when it came to the background of the main protagonist. It didn't take long after these tweets were brought to light for the staff of the anime to step away from the project, with all of the show's main voice staff spearheading the departure. Following the news of this, MINE would go on to issue a public apology on Twitter stating "As for several tweets I previously made, they caused many people a great deal of discomfort, and I truly apologize for the improper language.” Additionally, the now defamed creator shared he would be leaving his message of apology live on his account until the message had spread before he would later proceed to delete his Twitter account entirely. Allegedly he intended to approach the publisher of New Life+: Young Again in Another World regarding removing content that might make readers feel uncomfortable, though it was later announced that shipments of the light novel would be suspended immediately. This isn't the first time we've seen an industry figure defamed for online remarks; as a matter of a fact, it hasn't even been 12 months since the last instance. You might remember just four months ago in February we saw the ousting of Kazuyoshi Yaginuma, director of Recovery of an MMO Junkie, outed for his frequent Anti-Semitic remarks on Twitter. Fortunately, in that instance, actions were again swiftly taken out, though it's disappointing to see such instances take place so closely, let alone at all.

Revealed during an anonymous interview with Buzzfeed Japan during late-May, a former member of Pixiv's spearheaded idol group project Niji no Conquistador under the anonym "A" shared three primary instances of sexual harassment from the company president, two of which he and his lawyers admitted to. Following Hiroaki Nagata's resignation, it was revealed by Pixiv that the reason for his departure was due to "difficulty in fulfilling his role as company president." While the resignation is a step in the right direction for the company, much question remains as to why it took them so long to take action. Additionally, the resignation of Nagata does not negate the fact that the former company president is currently undertaking a libel lawsuit against "A" for "defaming" him by speaking up in regards to his actions, where he continues to deny the alleged third instance of sexual harassment. Snippets of our previous write-ups regarding the matter can be found below: Originally formed in 2014 as part of a new idol project spearheaded by Pixiv, Niji no Conquistador rapidly rose to become a household name amongst fans of the idol genre. It was because of this that Pixiv had such a heavy hand in both the group and individual activities of the idols involved, which would inevitably put "A" in contact with Hiroyuki Nagata initially. According to the Buzzfeed Japan report, one of many incidents includes "A" being accompanied by Nagata to Kyoto after the president learned she would be traveling alone, and then having the two share both a room and a bed. This made "A" extremely uncomfortable, but nothing was said at the risk of it ruining her career as an idol. It's no secret that the idol industry can often be filled with low-salaries, something that often leaves starry-eyed idols working part-time jobs to make ends meet. With that being said, it wouldn't be much longer after the first incident that "A" would approach Nagata to ask permission to work part-time externally from either Pixiv or the idol group to supplement her 30,000 JPY ($275 USD) monthly pay from the Niji no Conquistador work. Nagata was quick to deny her request, instead suggesting that he pay her himself if she was willing to give him full body massages. Though she was reluctant, "A" knew she had to make the money, and it was clear she wasn't going to be allowed to work externally. Later during the interview, it was also stated that Nagata specially requested "A" stay at his family house during a special live event from the group, rather than stay at a hotel or member dormitory. "A" states that during this stay, she noticed hidden cameras scattered across the house, originating in the changing room but then changing locations throughout her stay. Though Hiroyuki Nagata has admitted to both the Kyoto trip and massage incidents, he has actively denied the hidden cameras. It's reported that this continued harassment has left a lasting negative effect on "A", including rapid weight loss and memory-induced vomiting. "A"'s sexual harassment claims and the legal case come forward following the traction-gaining #metoo movement that has been taking off throughout Japan during 2018, with "A" stating that the movement inspired her to speak up about her own experiences. Following the revelations, numerous individuals on Twitter and other social media platforms have rightfully been calling for a full boycott of Pixiv and its service.

Accompanying the announcement was an all-new PV trailer featuring a preview of the song as well as a look into the 21st Pokémon film's story. Opening in Japanese theaters on July 13, the film follows Ash as he makes his way to Frau City during the annual Wind Festival where legendary Pokémon Lugia blesses the city with its wind. While Porno Graffiti might not be a household name internationally, they certainly get their fair share of airtime here in Japan. Best known outside of their home country for their involvement in series such as My Hero Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist, and more, this certainly won't be the first time the band has worked with anime. With a name like Porno Graffiti, however, you've just gotta wonder what international screenings of the child-oriented film will do as the music credits roll. From the preview alone the band's performance with "Breath" certainly has me excited, and I can't wait to see how the theme is actually implemented into the film. With a scheduled opening date of July 13 in Japan, I guess I won't be waiting much longer to find out though.

Set to open in Japan on July 20, the third trailer previews the film's ending theme as performed by the legendary Tatsuro Yamashita who has previously worked with Hosoda on his previous anime sensation Summer Wars. Helmed by Studio Chizu, Mamoru Hosoda's own animation group, the film is also slated to see much of his frequent collaborators return. It'll come as no surprise that the film looks absolutely gorgeous, pulling out Hosoda's carefully defined palette of techniques in a gorgeous array. Coupled with soundtrack work by Tatsuro Yamashita, you've got the recipe for something incredible laid out right in front of you. With a total runtime of 100-minutes, we can definitely expect to be whisked away on yet another one of Hosoda's anthropomorphic adventures. The film is described down below: The film's story centers around a family living in a small house in an obscure corner of a certain city — in particular, the family's spoiled four-year-old boy Kun-chan. When Kun-chan gets a little sister named Mirai, he feels that his new sister stole his parents' love from him, and is overwhelmed by many experiences he undergoes for the first time in his life. In the midst of it all, he meets an older version of Mirai, who has come from the future. While we're not quite sure just when it'll be, the film is currently slated to open in 86 countries around the globe. The film's producer Yuichiro Saito has also stated in the past that deals for distribution include a requirement to screen the film in theaters first, as well as broadcast and streaming rights for those who pick it up.

Sitting down with Japanese gaming magazine and publication Famitsu, Ishihara shares various pieces of information regarding both the upcoming Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! titles that are set to release later this year, as well as the much-anticipated 2019 title. “The new title coming out in the second half of 2019 will be a completely different game [from Pokémon Let’s Go]," shares Ishihara. "The reason we can release a [Pokémon Let's Go] at this timing is that development started when the Switch launched.” When Pokémon Let's Go was initially announced, many long-time fans noted concerns over the departure from various key-elements of Pokémon's long-standing gameplay style. “The process and tempo of catching Pokémon Let’s Go is completely different. You can swing the Joy-Con with a single hand to toss the Poké Ball, so it has a much different feel to it.” When talking about the upcoming 2019 core Pokémon RPG, it seems Tsunekazu Ishihara isn't afraid to talk about the title with confidence; “We want to make Pokémon fans say ‘this is what I’ve been waiting for’ by delivering a brand-new product packed with gameplay elements and plenty of new Pokémon to encounter.” While we're still quite a large period of time away from the late-2019 release timeframe for the game, there's certainly a lot of reasons to be excited.

Based out of Japan, NUE ZZZ is set to totally flip the conventions and perceptions of Tokyo's broadening fashion scene by utilizing moji8fresh's massively diverse color palette and design sensibility. Coming in hot with a massive sixteen-piece initial collection, words can't express how excited I am to see how far NUE ZZZ can take this style. Stemming from the creative mind of Jun Arai, perhaps best known for his creative flow as moji8fresh, the visionary creative long stood as the genius behind both design and graphics for fellow Tokyo-based fashion brand Galaxxxy. During his years working with Galaxxxy, we saw a number of the brand's most inspired pieces, and we can't wait to see what he brings to the table independently through NUE ZZZ. It's far from the toned down colors Tokyo is used to, and that simply makes NUE ZZZ all the better, bringing a new level of inspiration to the monotone streets. With a special focus on an international audience, NUE ZZZ has already announced plans to bring the brand overseas with international shipping set to launch soon. With a fully unisex lineup of clothing and the design experience to offer a promising future for the company, we couldn't be more excited to see what moji8fresh comes up with. As a bonus incentive, those who jump on the brand early are offered a limited-edition NUE ZZZ branded tote bag for the first 100 online customers. Those interested in checking out the full lineup of clothing from NUE ZZZ, as well as those interested in picking up any number of these incredible pieces, you can head over to the brand's official website.

According to initial reports following the product's announcement, it's told that Coca-Cola Japan initially came up with the drink concept a year ago before later handing the idea over to the United States branch to bring it to life. Set to launch in less than a week on June 11, the product has been announced as exclusive to Japan. While Japan has been awash with these clear drink products, most notably the widely-loathed clear latte from Asahi that we wrote about recently, initial reports on Coca-Cola Clear have allegedly been mostly positive. If there's any one thing you can bet on from any Japanese Coca-Cola release, it's that it's bound to have some form of lemon in it, and Coca-Cola Clear is no exception. With over 50 samples presented as potential candidates for the product release, it was eventually widdled down to this lemon-infused flavor. While competitor company Pepsi Co. have previously made headlines some 26 years ago with the release of Crystal Pepsi across the United States, this is the first time Coca-Cola has put together a transparent drink in mass-production. While we're not quite sure what to expect from this product release, let alone how long it'll be around for, you can bet we'll be making our way to our local convenience store to give it a go come June 11.

Announced during Kyary Pamyu Pamyu's first ever KPP Camp event, a project that could be compared to a "battle of the bands" event internationally, fans of the hyper-stylish artist can expect to see her fourth studio album come to life in the near future. While details were certainly scarce, Kyary wasn't shy to announce an accompanying nationwide hall tour in Japan beginning September 2018. We've been waiting for almost four years since the release of Kyary Pamyu Pamyu's third studio album, Pika Pika Fantajin, which released all the way back in 2014. While we have since seen a number of new singles, including the most recent "Kimi no Mikata," things on the Kyary front have mostly been silent outside of a continuous slew of TV appearances in Japan and a currently ongoing world tour. With that being said, there's definitely a lot to look forward to in regards to a new album, with Kyary's ongoing musical theme of "maturity" developing more and more over the past few years. With nineteen stops included in the accompanying nationwide hall tour, fans will be able to pick up their tickets in Japan from June 3 - June 7.

The landmark film in the creator's career couldn't come at a better time, with initial reviews of the film praising it for its incredible performance and surprising depth, something many failed to expect upon initial glances at the film. Initially premiered in Australia during publisher Madman's annual Madman Anime Festival in Brisbane over the past weekend, fans weren't shy in expressing their favorability of the film, and it's not without good reason. Mari Okada isn't afraid of proving her diverse skillset in Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, making for a memorable journey from start to finish that I haven't been able to get enough of, much like most everything else Mari Okada touches. Madman describes the film below: The people of Iorph have a lifespan of hundreds of years and maintain their teenage appearances for life, but when the peace of this town is shattered by those who want the secret to their longevity for themselves, a young girl named Maquia is forced to escape. Wandering the land alone, upon finding an orphaned baby she chooses to raise him, but as this boy grows up so the difference in their lifespans is thrown into ever-sharper relief. There's been an undeniable jump the overall awareness of anime films over the past couple of years internationally, largely kicked off by the phenomenon that was Makoto Shinkai's your name. If this was to be considered the benchmark of a great anime film, then it'd definitely be worth a few points to know that even Shinkai himself considers Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms to be a "fantastic film." With screenings across Australia beginning June 7, you'll definitely want to head over to Madman's official website to find your nearest cinema. |Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, Maquia, Mari Okada
13630|2018-06-04|17:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/pixiv-president-counter-sue-nijicon/| News | N/A | Pixiv President Launches Counter Libel Following Lawsuit Over Sexual Harassment | Following recent revelations of sexual harassment from Pixiv president Hiroaki Nagata towards a formerly associated idol, Nagata has announced a counter libel lawsuit against the idol. |Following recent revelations that include two counts of confirmed sexual harassment from Pixiv company president Hiroaki Nagata towards an anonymous former Niji no Conquistador idol, as well as the idol's following lawsuit against Nagata, news has come forward that Hiroaki Nagata has launched a libel lawsuit against "A" and her lawyer for defamation. The news comes just days after we initially shared Buzzfeed Japan's interview with the former idol where she detailed three acts of sexual harassment from the Pixiv president. According to the initial interview, "A" has been deeply emotionally affected by the instances of sexual harassment, one count of which included forceful sharing of a bed during a shared trip to Kyoto that "A" had refuted from the beginning. While this instance was confirmed, alongside reports that Hiroaki Nagata had denied "A" the right to work a part-time job to supplement her idol work (at the time she was making roughly $275 a month from Niji no Conquistador), instead insisting that he pays her personally for massages at a rate of 5,000 yen per hour as to alleviate the burden placed on her parents due to her low income. Where the libel lawsuit most notably comes into play, however, is the third instance of reported sexual harassment where "A" insists that Hiroaki Nagata hid cameras in his house during a non-routine event where he asked "A" to stay at his family home. While Nagata and his lawyers weren't afraid to admit to the other two accounts, they have consistently denied this report. It's detailed that throughout her stay at Nagata's family house, she noticed the cameras move multiple times, and had absolutely no idea what to do about it other than confide in Niji no Conquistador members. Originally launched as a Pixiv spearheaded idol group, Niji no Conquistador debuted in 2014 with Hiroaki Nagata acting as the producer. This would, of course, be where "A" first came into contact with the company president, and would later become the source of the instances of sexual harassment. The consistent silence on the end of Pixiv regarding this matter is extremely problematic, to say the very least. "A" shared during the initial Buzzfeed Japan interview that it is largely because of the recent #metoo movement in Japan that she found the courage to speak up. While things are certainly taking a disgusting turn as Hiroaki Nagata continues his tirade against "A", we'll be sure to keep you updated as further information regarding the lawsuits is revealed. Until then, however, be sure to take a look at the original piece where we detailed the entire situation as laid out by "A", here.|Hiroaki Nagata, Niji No Conquistador, Pixiv, a-san

Taking the front page position loud and proud, the latest issue of Shueisha's long-running Weekly Shonen Jump magazine confirmed all the leaks, announcing the anime adaptation of Kimetsu no Yaiba and also it's handling by Studio Ufotable. While the above PV is currently region-locked to Japan, it does an excellent job of capturing our excitement in a matter of seconds through that flash clip of Kamado and the announcement details that follow. Originally published in Weekly Shonen Jump back in 2016, the series follows farmboy Kamado whose life is turned upside down when his family is slaughtered, on top of his sister also being transformed into a demon. This Taisho-era story follows the two as they embark on a tale of swordplay, blood, and revenge, and has ranked consistently high in the weekly Jump rankings. While additional information is currently scarce, we gave a brief overview of the leaks in our previous article.

It's not like much else you'll hear in the idol industry, and it's that very sense of individuality that makes this group gleam so brightly.

Each sticker features a different manga panel of a different character with the speech bubble text edited to promote the anime - for example, one uses a panel of Emma standing and shouting on a bed in the orphanage and replaces the text with “Everyone, wake up! We’re getting an anime!”. There are nine of these unique stickers to collect, but don’t worry about not getting your favorite character - if you share a special link from the website, you can pick one of the nine available stickers yourself, meaning that you don’t have to completely rely on luck. Furthermore, if you share a picture of the store itself on social media, then you will also receive another special sticker that commemorates the limited-time store. All in all, you can receive a total of three exclusive stickers, meaning that your 500 yen can go a surprisingly long way. In terms of collaborations, this is one of the more left-field ideas I’ve seen, but you’d struggle to find anybody who’d pass on the chance to eat some amaguri - perhaps making it a surprising stroke of genius. In any case, The Promised Neverland deserves to get some hype going for its anime adaptation, as it’s been consistently excellent since it started in Jump back in 2016. So if you’re in the Shibuya area this weekend, be sure to go and pay the store a visit for some sweet treats and to help promote what will hopefully be an excellent anime.

13626|2018-06-04|13:00||http://otaquest.com/hunter-x-hunter-future-interview/| News | Manga | 'Hunter X Hunter' Mangaka Talks the Series' Future in New Interview | It’s hard to talk about Hunter x Hunter without talking about its constant hiatuses, and series creator Yoshihiro Togashi didn’t exactly shy away from the topic either. |It has always tough being a Hunter x Hunter fan - despite how great the series is, the manga has always been plagued by constant hiatuses, making being a fan of the series more infuriating than it really ought to be. That being said, a recent interview conducted in last week’s issue of Weekly Shonen Jump (issue 26) sheds some light on the future of the series, as well as author Yoshihiro Togashi’s attitude towards it as a whole. The interview began with a discussion of Togashi’s career, starting with the now-legendary Yu Yu Hakusho in 1990 and then the lesser-known, short-lived science fiction story Level E in 1995. According to Togashi, when developing his next series Hunter x Hunter, he was mainly preoccupied with what would “catch on” - no doubt because of the short-lived success of Level E. Even so, he still wanted to make the series unique, and found a way to do this through the main character, Gon Freecss. By taking a character who seems like a “good kid” and giving him a “scariness,” Togashi wanted to surprise readers and keep them invested - as well as making the series as a whole more interesting. In turn, this confirms what fans have been saying for years, that Gon is purposely intended to be subversive in his characterization and his later character development. Nevertheless, it’s hard to talk about Hunter x Hunter without talking about its constant hiatuses, and Togashi didn’t exactly shy away from the topic either. He disputed the many fans who have accused him of not wanting to bother with the series anymore, stating that he still “has the drive to finish” and genuinely wants to. It truly does seem that Togashi is impaired by things out of his control, namely his chronic back pain, which may put some of the more cynical fans at ease. Furthermore, he stated that creating manga in general is still very enjoyable for him, as he was constantly told he couldn’t do what he wanted as a kid - namely drawing - and so the fact that he now draws for a living gives him pleasure as a kind of “revenge” against all those who got in his way. Addressing another fan concern, Togashi argued that although ending the series after the Chairman Election arc would have made sense, he felt like he didn’t want to disappoint those who wanted to keep reading. Togashi also stated that if he was a reader then he too would’ve wanted to keep reading, therefore he felt like ending the series at that point would’ve been a shame. Besides, he still had lots of ideas for the series, so decided to continue onwards. It does seem after all that Togashi works for the fans, no matter how much he seems to be set on disappointing them with constant hiatuses - again due to things outside of his control. Togashi’s future post-Hunter x Hunter seems distant at this point, with Togashi himself joking that the end of the series might not come before he passes away, but he still has many things he’d like to do as an artist. For one, he’d love to try his hand at a love comedy, which definitely sounds like an amusing prospect. But he admits that to do something so different from his previous works would probably necessitate getting someone else to draw the art for him - a tactic many fans have been behind adopting for Hunter x Hunter itself in order to lessen the strain on Togashi and help the plot progress. At the end of the day, however, Togashi admits that he “has to finish writing Hunter x Hunter” before he can even think about his future - a good display of resolve that should reassure fans. But one thing is for certain - Togashi will always consider Jump his home. When asked what Jump is to him, he replied: “It makes me think that I’d always like to be here.” Togashi’s experimental and unique works have always found a home in the pages of Jump - a fact that sometimes seems contradictory to the content of his works - but nevertheless something that Togashi truly appreciates. That being said, wherever you end up in the future - be it wrapped up in a new series or still slaving away at Hunter x Hunter - we’ll be here to support you, Togashi-sensei.|Hunter x Hunter, Yoshihiro Togashi, hxh

With their latest collection, [ VIRTUAL UNIVERSE ], they're doing exactly that; the final release scheduled from them before the end of the Heisei Era here in Japan. Created in collaboration with designer urauny, Chloma has announced their limited-time showroom exhibit preceding the collection's release. Taking place in the backend of Shibuya's Jingumae area from June 12 until June 17, this will be our first look at what the brand has planned for the upcoming season. Previous iterations of the brand's clothing lines have seen the use of AR technology through head-mounted displays such as Microsoft's Holo-Lens, inviting customers to use the future-tech to digitally try on all their clothing regardless of location. Recent times have also seen an increased appearance outside of niche communities, with artists such as Virtual Self most recently seen wearing various pieces during live performances. Taking place at the underground (literally, not figuratively) BLOCKHOUSE B1F store located in-between both Shibuya and Harajuku, you'll be able to check out the latest collection between June 12 - June 17. Further details can be found below: [ SHOWROOM SCHEDULE ] 2018/6/12 13:00-20:00 2018/6/13 12:00-20:00 2018/6/14 12:00-20:00 2018/6/15 12:00-20:00 2018/6/16 12:00-20:00 2018/6/17 12:00-18:00 [ PLACE ] BLOCK HOUSE B1F 東京都渋谷区神宮前 6-12-9 地下1階 Those interested in making their way to the showroom should visit Chloma's official website for further information.

13618|2018-06-01|17:00||http://otaquest.com/kimetsu-no-yaiba-anime-rumor/| News | Anime , Manga | Supposed Leaks Suggest ‘Kimetsu no Yaiba’ TV Anime by Ufotable | According to supposed leaks, Kimetsu no Yaiba will be receiving an anime adaptation headed by none other than the legendary Studio Ufotable. |We finally saw the official announcement of the highly anticipated The Promised Neverland anime adaptation earlier this week, and now it seems like yet another Weekly Shonen Jump property is getting the anime treatment - this time we're looking at Koyoharu Gotouge’s recent Kimetsu no Yaiba. Launched in 2016, Gotouge’s manga follows farmboy Tanjirou whose life is turned upside down when his family is slaughtered by demons, on top of his sister also being transformed into a demon. This Taisho-era story follows the two as they embark on a tale of swordplay, blood, and revenge, and has ranked consistently high in the weekly Jump rankings. The manga saw the release of the tenth volume recently, making it a good time for an anime adaptation to come out without the risk of it catching up to the manga. According to leaks from Twitter user Yonkou Productions (who previously leaked news on The Promised Neverland’s anime adaptation), the manga will be receiving an anime adaptation headed by none other than the legendary Studio Ufotable, who have been behind several excellent adaptations of the Fate series and Touken Ranbu. The studio has in the past been praised for their excellent animation quality, particularly for Fate/Zero, which is considered by many to be one of the best-looking anime ever made. It should go without saying, Ufotable taking charge of this adaptation is exciting news indeed. Author Gotouge also seems to be excited about the prospects of the adaptation, stating that although his artwork is the type to “break down if breathed on,” Ufotable have assured him that they will be going ahead with production and are going to try and make a great anime. Gotouge’s sketchy yet expressive art style is certainly unique, but I have no doubt that the studio will strive to make it work in animated form as they have done in so many of their other adaptations in the past. A leaked promotional image for the anime drawn by Ufotable shows off how they are adapting the character designs to work in animated form, and it seems like they are doing great work as usual: The anime announcement is rumored to appear in next week’s Shonen Jump, and there will presumably be more details such as an official Twitter account and website detailed at that time, so keep your eyes peeled for more information as it comes in. VIZ Media is currently releasing the manga in English, which is available to read via their official website.

13617|2018-06-01|16:00||http://otaquest.com/crayon-shin-chan-va-retires/| News | Anime | ‘Crayon Shin-chan’ Voice Actor to Retire After 26 Years | Akiko Yajima has been providing the iconic voice of Shinnosuke since the start of the show’s broadcast in 1992, and her performance has been a key part of why the show has continued to be popular among Japanese children even today. |There are many starting points to get into the world of anime, and for many in East Asia, that starting point was the long-running series Crayon Shin-chan. In particular, the voice of the titular Shinnosuke Nohara is one that I’m sure many fans hold close to their heart, which makes it even more heartbreaking to hear that his voice actor will be stepping down from the role after twenty-six years, as the official Shin-chan website revealed this morning. Akiko Yajima has been providing the iconic voice of Shinnosuke since the start of the show’s broadcast in 1992, and her performance has been a key part of why the show has continued to be popular among Japanese children even today. The huge amount of time Yajima has spent on the show also seems to weigh heavy on her shoulders, as she posted a personal message on the Shin-chan website expressing her gratitude for all the support she has received over the years, and that she hopes that fans will continue to support the show. As for why Yajima is stepping down from the role, she cites continuing difficulty in producing Shinnosuke’s voice, which is hardly surprising considering how unique the voice is. Even so, she hopes that fans support the next voice actor in the role of Shinnosuke, who they are currently in the process of confirming. Considering that Shin-chan is such an iconic character as well as an important programme for TV Asahi, there shouldn’t be too much time before we get official confirmation of the successor so that the programme’s schedule isn’t adversely affected. Yajima’s final performance as Shinnosuke will air on September 26, meaning we've still got a little time with her, but we wish her all the best in the future. Shin-chan will continue regardless, entertaining children and adults alike every Friday at 7 pm.|Crayon Shin-chan, Akiko Yajima

Aka Akasaka’s love-comedy manga has been consistently popular in the seinen sister magazine to Weekly Shonen Jump, Young Jump, and it seems as though that popularity in direct correlation to its anime adaptation. The announcement came from the recently launched Twitter account, which was launched next to the official website. The project also shared a promotional visual of Kaguya-sama herself, which you can check out below: The mangaka also took to Twitter to share a few words about the anime announcement and to express their gratitude, saying that the adaptation was “Thanks to everyone,” and that they “will try their best to not get in the way of the excellent staff.” They also shared a special commemorative drawing of Kaguya to celebrate: We’ve had no confirmation as to the staff list of the anime just yet, but from this comment, there certainly seems to be at least a couple of staff members attached to the project at this early stage of development. A premiere date has yet to be shared, so I'm sure we can expect some more information at a later date. In the meantime, it'll definitely be worth keeping your eyes peeled on both the official website and Twitter account. Those unfamiliar with the series, VIZ Media describes the original manga below: All's fair when love is war! Two geniuses. Two brains. Two hearts. One battle. Who will confess their love first...?! Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are two geniuses who stand atop their prestigious academy's student council, making them the elite among elite. But it's lonely at the top and each has fallen for the other. There's just one huge problem standing in the way of lovey-dovey bliss—they're both too prideful to be the first to confess their romantic feelings and thus become the “loser” in the competition of love! And so begins their daily schemes to force the other to confess first!

If there was ever need of evidence to this statement, how about the fact that the supergroup's latest single, "Teacher Teacher," managed to sell over 1.6 million physical copies in just 24 hours following its release? Setting a mind-boggling new record for the Akihabara-bred idol group, let's take a look at what "Teacher Teacher" is really all about below: With the annual Senbatsu Election finally here, eager fans were quick to snap up the single so they could vote for their favorite idol in any participating 48 group. Chances are in the past you might have heard of the event, and chances are it probably wasn't for a good reason -- unless of course, you were one of many participating fans in the event. Such calls for participation on behalf of the group has well been documented as a cause for fans buying extreme volumes of CDs to help propel the careers of their favorite member. What's going to happen to these 1.6 million CDs that are now in circulation amongst fans remains to be seen, but let's just hope they aren't illegally dumped like in the past.

13606|2018-06-01|00:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/pokemon-gold-silver-prototype/| News | Games | Pokémon Gold & Silver Prototype Reveals Unused Content | After 20 years we finally get a sneak peek of the original demo of Pokémon Gold & Silver. An anonymous source leaked the demo from Nintendo's 1997 Spaceworld event, which includes a debug mode and plenty of never before seen content! |In November 1997 Nintendo gave the world its first glimpse at the follow up to their massively successful Gameboy debut of Pokemon at their annual Spaceworld event. Rumors & leaked information had already been circulating for months, with die-hard fans whispering to each other about new potential legendary monsters and the new water mouse, Pikablu. This new demo Nintendo shared at Spaceworld in 1997 did little to contain the speculation, with several new monster designs being discussed by the lucky players who saw the game. Yet when the new titles, called Gold & Silver, were released on Gameboy Color a few years later in 1999 many of these reported Pocket Monsters were nowhere to be seen. Were the fans at Spaceworld pulling our leg? Did Nintendo make last-minute changes to the game? What happened to the starter Pokemon that were present originally? While we don't know the answers to all of these questions, we do finally have confirmation of those original reports thanks to an anonymous source that leaked the infamous demo earlier today. Players are still pouring over the demo to discover all of the differences featured in the game, some of which are immediately noticeable. Being an early version of a massive title this shouldn't be much of a surprise, but the never before seen content featured in this demo sheds light on what could have been. And some of the changes and omissions would have had an impact on some of the most popular characters in the franchise for nearly 20 years. Right off the bat, there's a significant difference in the Pokemon available to you at the start. Gone are Cyndaquil, Totodile, and their evolutionary chains; instead replaced by 6 completely different monsters of the fire & water variety. Chikorita also receives a different secondary evolution in Hanamogura. In addition to these rejected monsters are several rejected baby evolutions for 1st generation Monsters like Vulpix, Meowth, and Grimer. There's a lot more in this prototype than I could ever hope to discover or even understand myself, but being able to see the hidden history behind one of the world's most beloved franchises is absolutely fascinating. I fondly remember days in my youth spent on long defunct Pokemon websites discussing all of our theories about the new Pokemon games, and what it could mean for the future of the franchise. To see something like this pop up after so long is nothing shy of magical. I'll definitely be keeping an eye out on all of the treasure that is unearthed as the game is scoured more thoroughly, and if you want to read into it a bit more yourself you can find a thread about the demo on Resetera or follow along at video game archival wiki The Cutting Room Floor.|Pokemon, Pocket Monsters, Gold & Silver, Prototype, Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Nintendo, Spaceworld

He's the genius behind some of the greatest musical releases of the 80s, including the much adored "For You" LP that originally released in 1982 (Yes, that's the one with the Turners radio store illustration on the cover). Recent years have seen a resurgence in his musical activities, and most recently, we've been treated to the announcement that his latest Double A-Side release will be hitting shelves across Japan on July 11, 2018.

We're yet to hear exactly how they're going to sound, but I'm already positive that they'll easily be one of my most listened to tracks of the Summer. Set to release on July 11 in Japan, Tatsuro Yamashita's latest will be titled “Mirai no Theme / Uta no Kisha”, with the cover jacket showcased above.

We’ve already had several anime projects to commemorate this milestone this year, such as Masaaki Yuasa’s Devilman crybaby, but a new exhibition will be bringing together all of the works from his illustrious career into one place. Taking place in Osaka and Tokyo in September, the Go Nagai 50th Anniversary Exhibition will display over 600 color illustrations from the 350 works that Nagai has been involved in, all the way from the very beginning of his career to his latest works. They will be separated into different ‘areas,’ themed around the various aspects of Nagai’s career, from his comedy works to his meditations on the apocalypse. Particular focus will be placed on areas related to Mazinger Z and Devilman, which will feature things “not usually shown” - perhaps preliminary sketches and manuscripts. Furthermore, Nagai himself will be conducting a signing event at the Osaka exhibition on the opening day of September 8, giving fans a rare chance to meet the legend himself. Applications for the event are limited to 100 persons who send an application via post to the exhibition headquarters, however, so make sure to send a letter off as soon as possible from June 1 to July 7 to be in with this rare chance. It’s unclear as of the time of writing whether Nagai will also conduct a signing event at the Tokyo exhibition, but considering that only the Osaka exhibition has had concrete details outlined for it, it’s probably safe to say that we can expect some more information at a later date. If you’re in Japan at the time of the exhibition, then be sure to pre-purchase your tickets from a variety of retailers such as eplus and Lawson, as well as in anime goods chain stores such as Animate and Tora no Ana, to receive a 200 yen discount from the regular, same day price of 1500 yen, and also to receive some great, limited goodies. Buying a special, three ticket set will not only give you three regular tickets at a discounted rate, but also tickets with a special design from Devilman, Mazinger Z, and Cutie Honey. In addition, you can apply for special tickets that include special goods, such as a Great Mazinger figure for 5600 yen. Tickets go on sale from June 1, so don’t miss out!

Let's take a look at the new pre-order trailer below: The eleventh entry into the iconic Mega Man series leaves our favorite blue bomber tussling with a number of Dr. Wily's new Robot Masters as Mega Man collects new powers to work his way through the 2D platformer. While a number of cast members from the game have already been revealed, it appears likely that we'll be seeing a number of other new friends and enemies during E3 presentations this year, so those looking forward to the game should definitely keep a close eye on that. The game is described by Capcom below: The newest entry in this iconic series blends classic, challenging 2D platforming action with a fresh look. The stunning new visual style refreshes the series' iconic colorfulness, combining hand-drawn environments with detailed, 3D characters.

This is massive news, and the timing of the announcement couldn't possibly have been better. Details on the title are scarce, I mean, we quite literally were only graced with the Pokémon logo on a white background with the subtext "New title coming in 2019!" but there's more to it than that. With #PokemonQuest and #PokemonLetsGo, there are so many new ways to explore the world of Pokémon! Trainers can look forward to even more with an all-new core series Pokémon RPG title in development for the second half of 2019! pic.twitter.com/d5uiIpenMI — Pokémon (@Pokemon) 30 May 2018 While I'm personally extremely excited for the possibilities contained within the world of Pokémon: Let's Go, I completely understand that this isn't made to be the hardcore Pokémon RPG that fans of the series are used to. That's because, well, it's probably not meant to be. Since the 2016 release of Pokémon GO on smartphone devices across the globe, The Pokémon Company have likely been working feverishly to try and captivate the 800 million plus downloads of the application as more than just casual fans of the franchise. What's the best way to do this? Create a game that is both inviting to casual players but interesting enough to hold the attention of even veteran fans of the series before reintroducing everyone to a proper core Pokémon title in the latter half of 2019. There's nothing but speculation on our side as it stands right now, will this all-new game introduce us to Generation VII of Pokémon, or will it see us returning to one of the regions we found ourselves lost in before? Only time will tell, but you can bet we'll be watching closely. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed.|Pokémon: Let's Go, Pokemon Quest, Pokemon
13595|2018-05-30|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/pokemon-quest-switch-mobile-release/| News | Games | Pokémon Quest Releases on Nintendo Switch, Coming Soon on Mobile Devices | Revealed and released today for Nintendo Switch, and with a mobile release planned later, Pokémon Quest is the latest free-to-play endeavor from Pokemon Company. |Revealed today alongside both Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!, Pokémon Quest is the latest spinoff title to join the Pokémon franchise. Available as of today via the Nintendo Switch eShop as a free-to-play "rambunctious expedition RPG” from Game Freak, the game already has its eyes set on the mobile marketplace, with a planned release timeframe of June 2018. It's a lot to take in, especially given its odd visual departure from the norm when it comes to Pokémon game -- just give it a look: Set on the previously unheard of cube-filled Tumblecube Island, trainers must embark on an adventure with their team of three different Pokémon (referred to in-game as Pokéxel) as you upgrade your camp and discover new friends. It's an odd concept, as especially highlighted by the launch trailer, but I'm sure it could warrant a mindless amount of gameplay. Pokémon will spend the majority of the game moving on their own, with players simply controlling their attacks during battle sequences. Game Freak describes the game below: Tumblecube Island is the setting for Pokémon Quest, a rambunctious action RPG created by GAME FREAK inc., the developer of many of your favorite Pokémon titles. The landscape and inhabitants of Tumblecube Island have a boxy, cube-like look to them, resulting in a Pokémon adventure that looks like none before it. There is no denying that the cube versions of these Pokémon that were originally discovered in the Kanto region are simply adorable! In this free-to-start adventure, players set off on expeditions with a team of three Pokémon to explore Tumblecube Island and find its hidden treasures. The Pokémon will move on their own, leaving it up to the player to direct their attacks when wild Pokémon approach. By equipping your Pokémon with Power Stones found during your journeys, you can customize their skills. Different Power Stones grant different effects such as increased energy, strength, speed, and more! As your Pokémon’s levels increase, they will be able to equip more Power Stones. Players have a Base Camp to relax at in between missions. At the Base Camp, ingredients found during expeditions can be cooked into delicious treats that are bound to attract new Pokémon to join your team. The Base Camp can also be customized with a wide variety of cute decorations that will grant special effects to your team. Some items will be available for purchase at bargain prices using real-world money. Available now on Nintendo Switch via the eShop as a free download, and coming soon to mobile devices, you can find further information on Pokémon Quest via the title's official website.|Pokemon Quest, Nintendo Switch, Pokemon Switch, Pokemon, Nintendo, Game Freak
13594|2018-05-30|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/pokemon-lets-go-announcement/| News | Games | Pokémon: Let's Go Pikachu & Pokémon: Let's Go Eevee Announced for Switch | Earlier today saw the announcement of a number of new Pokémon titles for Nintendo Switch, with particular highlight given to both Pokémon: Let's Go Pikachu & Pokémon: Let's Go Eevee. |Today has been an absolutely incredible day for both fans of the Pokémon series and owners of the Nintendo Switch, with Pokémon Company earlier today announcing a slew of new games on Nintendo's latest hybrid console and beyond. Perhaps most importantly at this current time, however, was the announcement of the upcoming Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! which is set to release globally on November 16, 2018, for Nintendo Switch. Inspired by the world of the original Pokémon Yellow from 1998, let's take a look at the two new games below: While just about anything related to the Pokémon franchise is enough to drum up excitement from me, I think there's legitimately a whole lot to look forward to in these upcoming games. From the all-new playstyle to the inclusion of co-op gameplay within the game, there's a lot of critical changes here that are set to truly make this feel like a console game. With that said, it's been made clear during the reveal that this was the whole point of this title; with emphasis placed on these titles being a home console game, while the later 2019 title is set to be a more portable game. One of the biggest parts of these games, however, is the clear inclusion and integration of the already released Pokémon GO into the game. With features that will allow trainers to trade Pokémon caught in both titles easily between the mobile application and the Switch release, as well as the newly-announced Poké Ball Plus add-on, it really does feel like they're going all-out in bringing these two games together. With that being said, who can blame them; Pokémon GO enjoyed global success at a scale perhaps never seen by the series, and bringing players and fans of the smartphone application into the Nintendo ecosystem only makes sense. While my own excitement is definitely growing for these upcoming Pokémon adventures, you can find further information ahead of release via the official website.|Pokémon: Let's Go Pikachu & Pokémon: Let's Go Eevee, Pokemon: Let's Go Pikachu, Pokemon: Let's Go Eevee, Pokemon, Switch, Nintendo Switch

Following an announcement shared via the Twitter account of Vincenzo Natali, director of the In the Tall Grass adaptation, we learned that legendary illustrator and creative Shintaro Kago would be handling conceptual designs for the upcoming film. Best known for his signature body horror paintings and manga series, Shintaro Kago has long been a praised creator within his respective field. I am deeply honored and proud to announce that @shintarokago is the conceptual designer of my adaptation of @joe_hill ‘s and @StephenKing ‘s IN THE TALL GRASS pic.twitter.com/FoBOFCCqOn — Vincenzo Natali (@Vincenzo_Natali) 28 May 2018 Originally published in 2012, In the Tall Grass was the second collaborative book between Stephen King and his son Joe Hill following the earlier-released Throttle. Three years after the book's original publication in 2015, it was announced that there would be a live-action adaptation of the film produced, with Vincenzo Natali acting as director. With that being said, the project never picked up off the ground. It would be in 2018, however, that Netflix would announce that they had acquired the rights to the film and would appoint Vincenzo Natali as director. While the attached image may purely be a concept design for the film, there's certainly a lot of reason to be excited. Bringing the worlds of powerhouse horror author Stephen King and body horror genius Shintaro Kago together for a single project could only possibly work out incredibly, so here's hoping that Vincenzo Natali is able to bring out the maximum potential of both.|Shintaro Kago, Stephen King, In the Tall Grass

13587|2018-05-29|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/niji-con-pixiv-sexual-harassment/| News | Music | Former Idol Suing Pixiv's President over Sexual Harassment Charges | A former member of Pixiv's spearhead idol group Niji No Conquistador is suing the current president of Pixiv social media website following reported sexual harassment. |Japanese digital artwork distribution and social media website Pixiv is currently under fire following revelations that a former Niji no Conquistador member is suing the current president of the company for numerous accounts of sexual harassment. Revealed during an anonymous interview with Buzzfeed Japan by the former idol, the victim who was referred to only as "A" recalled a number of incidents in which Pixiv president Hiroyuki Nagata overstepped both professional and personal boundaries. Originally formed in 2014 as part of a new idol project spearheaded by Pixiv, Niji no Conquistador rapidly rose to become a household name amongst fans of the idol genre. It was because of this that Pixiv had such a heavy hand in both the group and individual activities of the idols involved, which would inevitably put "A" in contact with Hiroyuki Nagata initially. According to the Buzzfeed Japan report, one of many incidents includes "A" being accompanied by Nagata to Kyoto after the president learned she would be traveling alone, and then having the two share both a room and a bed. This made "A" extremely uncomfortable, but nothing was said at the risk of it ruining her career as an idol. It's no secret that the idol industry can often be filled with low-salaries, something that often leaves starry-eyed idols working part-time jobs to make ends meet. With that being said, it wouldn't be much longer after the first incident that "A" would approach Nagata to ask permission to work part-time externally from either Pixiv or the idol group to supplement her 30,000 JPY ($275 USD) monthly pay from the Niji no Conquistador work. Nagata was quick to deny her request, instead suggesting that he pay her himself if she was willing to give him full body massages. Though she was reluctant, "A" knew she had to make the money, and it was clear she wasn't going to be allowed to work externally. Later during the interview, it was also stated that Nagata specially requested "A" stay at his family house during a special live event from the group, rather than stay at a hotel or member dormitory. "A" states that during this stay, she noticed hidden cameras scattered across the house, originating in the changing room but then changing locations throughout her stay. Though Hiroyuki Nagata has admitted to both the Kyoto trip and massage incidents, he has actively denied the hidden cameras. It's reported that this continued harassment has left a lasting negative effect on "A", including rapid weight loss and memory-induced vomiting. "A"'s sexual harassment claims and the legal case come forward following the traction-gaining #metoo movement that has been taking off throughout Japan during 2018, with "A" stating that the movement inspired her to speak up about her own experiences. Following the revelations, numerous individuals on Twitter and other social media platforms have rightfully been calling for a full boycott of Pixiv and its service. As of the time of writing, Hiroyuki Nagata continues to hold his position of power at the Pixiv social media site and no statements have been made either on the website or Pixiv's official Twitter account. Buzzfeed Japan allegedly reached out to Nagata for an interview though he quickly declined. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed regarding the matter.

Prior to this, we were introduced to the series' production staff and director, but in this latest video, we're given a special look at the legendary band behind the series' iconic music, The Pillows. When talking about the original 2000 FLCL anime series, it'd be near impossible to separate Gainax's signature anime stylings from The Pillows' iconic soundtrack. With that being said, there was a chance that pairing could have never happened - as explained by The Pillows vocalist Sawao Yamanaka. During the initial contact with FLCL's staff, the band showed very little interest in working together with an anime series, especially given their preconceived notions that doing so would bring about strict terms, it's admitted. With that being said, however, the band sent over a demo of what would eventually become "Ride on Shooting Star," figuring that if the staff didn't like that they had no need to work together. While the rest is certainly history, it's more than fortunate that The Pillows' self-admitted rudeness didn't get the whole project scrapped for them - as they share, it really did change their careers forever. The whole video is a great watch, and I'd definitely recommend it to any fans of either the series or the band. FLCL Progressive is set to premiere on Adult Swim's Toonami block on June 2nd at Midnight (ET).

13581|2018-05-28|17:00||http://otaquest.com/my-hero-academia-movie-new-visual/| News | Anime | New Visual, Original Characters Revealed for ‘My Hero Academia’ Movie | It’s hard to believe that summer is nearly here, but as the season draws near, so too does fresh information regarding the highly-anticipated My Hero Academia movie. |It’s hard to believe that Summer is nearly here, but as the season draws near, so too does fresh information regarding the highly-anticipated My Hero Academia movie. The official website for the movie revealed more information and a new visual ahead of it’s August 3 premiere over the weekend, showing off new characters alongside our old favorites: Next to Deku is Melissa Shield, a ‘Quirkless’ girl who Deku will encounter during the movie’s story. At the top right next to All Might is her father, David Shield. We also see Bakugo, Uraraka, Yaoyorozu, Kirishima, Iida, and Todoroki, whom will presumably be the main students featured in the movie. I can’t help but be disappointed that Tsuyu, the frog hero, isn’t present, but hopefully, she will make at least a small appearance in the movie itself. Information about the two new characters, Melissa and David, was also posted to the website as part of a new update to accompany the new key visual. David apparently played a large part in All Might’s formative years, even making his iconic costume as part of his job as a designer of hero support items. It’s probably safe to presume that the two will reminisce about the past at some point during the movie, perhaps giving us a rare chance to see All Might before he became the ‘Symbol of Peace.’ Looking into the information posted on the website about Melissa is also rather revealing. She feels self-conscious about her lack of Quirk and whether or not she can become a great man like her father - remarkably similar to Deku’s own struggles. He too was initially Quirkless, and even now struggles to control his inherited Quirk and live up to the legacy of All Might. These parallels mean that it’s probably safe to assume that Deku and Melissa’s relationship will be one of the main threads of the movie, giving Melissa a strong character arc as well as Deku an opportunity to show the audience how much he has grown through the events of the series thus far. Speculation aside, the movie opens on August 3 in Japanese theatres and I can’t wait to see what happens. In particular, the thought of seeing All Might in his younger days is exciting - so much mystery surrounds him, after all.

The official series Twitter account first broke the news with an official PV that features edited panels from the manga. Voices for Emma, Ray, and Norman are featured in the PV, and although we haven’t had official confirmation as to who the cast will be, they already sound like they’ve sunk well into the role. Let's check that out below: 禁断のTVアニメ化決定！！ 2019年1月より フジテレビ“ノイタミナ”ほかにて放送開始！ 「TVアニメ化決定PV」では、いち早くエマ・ノーマン・レイの声を聴くことができます。ぜひご覧ください！ ▼アニメ公式サイトhttps://t.co/oxUKzp4HWv#約束のネバーランド #約ネバ #ノイタミナ pic.twitter.com/kmLyWWd5iI — 『約束のネバーランド』公式 (@yakuneba_staff) 27 May 2018 The official website for the series, registered last month and noticed quickly by fans, also came to life to promote the premiere of the anime. It features character designs for the three main characters, and I’m very happy that the adaptation seems to have maintained Posuka Demizu’s neo-gothic aesthetic instead of simplifying it for the sake of easier animation. Also revealed was the January 2019 premiere date, which does seem a bit far away for a PV, but the recent leaks and rumors may have forced the project’s hand somewhat. Beyond this information, however, there hasn’t been much more revealed. No staff has yet to be attached to the project, although there are several leaked staff lists floating around social media. In particular, the new A-1 Pictures breakaway Koenji studio CloverWorks was touted to be heading up the project, but again there has been no official confirmation, so this information should be taken with a grain of salt. What we do know is that the adaptation will premier on Fuji TV’s ‘Noitamina’ programming block, which has always been traditionally home to more left-field and obscure adaptations. Although Neverland is hardly a small series, owing to its serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump as well as winning several awards earlier this year, I’m sure that it will fit right into the block due to its unmistakable style. Even with such little information, it’s hard to not get excited about this upcoming adaptation. The series has been making waves ever since its serialization in August 2016 and has been consistently excellent. It follows Emma and her friends, as they discover the horrible truth about the orphanage they grow up in and must escape.

The film is described below: Lupin searches for a gigantic hoard of hidden treasure originating in ancient Babylon, with the help of his usual team, a set of stone tablets, and a drunken old woman by the name of Rosetta.

Easily one of the most anticipated titles since the launch of Nintendo's latest console endeavor, Pokémon on the Switch has always seemed like an absolute no-brainer for the team at Game Freak. The details on the mailing list registration are certainly scarce, but they do seemingly hint that we might be close to hearing something regarding the title. The launch of any series title on Nintendo Switch would mark the first release of Pokémon content on the hybrid console. Often an experience largely reserved for Nintendo's portable devices, the visual possibilities and opportunity for new and exciting playstyles that a Nintendo Switch release would offer are enormous, something more than enough to get me excited. While Nintendo has remained tight-lipped about the announcements at this year's E3 event, an announcement for a new Pokémon title would surely be the sort of news needed to rival everything else they plan to showcase such as Super Smash Bros. and the new expansions for Splatoon 2. The timing for the launch of this new mailing list sure is interesting, and you can bet we'll be keeping a close eye on it in the coming months.

Is it a title bestowed on a work simply because it was developed by a studio in Japan? Are there certain qualities; any tropes in design, mechanics or storytelling that make a game distinctly Japanese? Is there a certain attention to detail provided in areas the likes of which cannot be found in a game developed elsewhere? And just why are JRPGs denoted as such? For as long as I can remember, I've chosen to play those games developed in Japan -- those with especially recognizable names surrounding them, like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima, because I genuinely felt a special kind of returned love -- a special kind of emotional connection. Before now, I would have struggled to tell you exactly why I felt as such, but a new documentary short has helped me realize so much more about my passion for the latest from Nintendo or Atlus. I recently discovered Archipel on YouTube, a channel that uploads some seriously well-produced videos fixated on Japanese artistry, and especially on the artists themselves. Their videos are usually 10 to 15 minutes in length, but the video that I would like to bring to your attention today is more than double that, clocking in at just about 40 minutes in length. Now, depending on who you are and how you view video games as a whole, 'Ebb and Flow - Conversations on the recent momentum of Japanese games' may contain exactly the kind of messages that you've been wanting to hear; it may contain exactly the conversation, discussion, and answers from the biggest names in the game development scene in Japan that you crave. If you tend to view the video game industry with a split between games developed in Japan and games developed in Western countries, this video is a must-see. If you view video games as a monolith -- the country of origin being of no matter -- then this video is also a must-see. Beginning towards the end of the year 2016, there was something of a deluge of very well-received, high-quality games. From Final Fantasy XV and The Last Guardian in the last months of 2016, to Resident Evil 7, Nier: Automata, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Persona 5 in the first half of 2017, and even now to the recent releases of Yakuza 6 and Monster Hunter World, there have been no shortage of amazing experiences all united by one factor: being developed by Japanese game creators. It seems like a distant memory now, but there was a period of time where you couldn't log-on to a gaming forum without seeing lamentation about the "state" of Japanese games. Had there really been a measurable quality-drop? What could have caused that? Persona 5 - Atlus Joining the likes of Nier: Automata's Yoko Taro and Persona 5 director Katsura Hashino is John Ricciardi, co-founder of prominent game localization company 8-4. He lead's off with the opinion that the recent slew of games that the company has worked on are not good because there was an effort to make them "Japanese," per se, but because the creators were inspired to make the games that they wanted to make -- a good game is just a good game. So perhaps what had faced the Japanese industry at that time was rather akin to an identity crisis. Without further adieu, go ahead and give the documentary a watch, and be sure to turn on those captions if they aren't already. I'll share a bunch of my thoughts below, and touch a tiny little bit on summary so as not to spoil the entire experience. So, if we now know what makes a game Japanese -- now that we know why there is this impulse to label games as "Japanese" or "Western," Katsura Hashino's simple connection between Japanese games and ramen made quite an impression on me. In an effort to "return" to a time where Japanese games were considered special and attention-grabbing, many creatives are of the opinion that there should be less of a need to imitate other game design decisions which may not even be necessary to make something enjoyable. According to Hashino, people have grown to love Japanese ramen because it's a dish with a fairly-standardized base, but it has been allowed to grow as a comfort food all across the country exactly because it is familiar. He goes on to say that if the dish were altered and arranged to fit the taste of another market entirely, then perhaps people would criticize what was being sold as no longer ramen. It hit me that perhaps this was the core of the supposed slump: too much was being done to try to adapt the "flavor" of a game to entirely different preferences, that those who had come to love that Japanese uniqueness felt let-down when that flavor was being changed too much. Another fascinating idea posited is the notion that by very nature of many Japanese games not being true "AAA" in nature, that the creators have more freedom to create something that they really think will resonate well with an audience. Nier: Automata's Yoko Taro notes how Western development studios have a very systematic way of doing things -- the game engines are well established, the other middleware is all streamlined, and job positions are clearly defined. A part of the Japanese identity, according to Taro, is relying on the director's vision in crafting the game's mechanics and overall direction to really bang out a quality product. An amount of old-fashioned elbow grease is required to reach the final stages of development, and it is up to the director has to be selfish in a way to realize the ultimate vision. He then goes on to make a rather delightful point about leaving auto-save features out of his games -- you didn't have to convince me Yoko Taro. As I was watching the documentary, I did notice a fair bit of difference in opinions. The world of game development is so diverse, that there is bound to be some of it. I believe that one of the most terrific things about this documentary is that it doesn't present any one factor as a hard negative or a hard positive -- it exists to inspire a conversation. Now that creators in Japan have carved out an environment in which they comfortable operating within, there is an undeniable air of positivity about the future. Even when creating new entries in long-standing franchises, the current air of re-focusing on what makes a game tick in a distinctly Japanese style should allow games in those series to feel new and fresh again. A new stage has been set, and as long as the stagehands continue giving it their utmost, there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that we've entered upon a new golden age for video gaming.

Thankfully, Studio MAPPA is finally bringing the manga to the screen this July, and they recently revealed a new PV along with a swathe of new details to promote the series. Check it out below: 【第２弾PV公開】【放送・配信情報】TVアニメ「BANANA FISH」は２０１８年７月５日よりフジテレビ”ノイタミナ”ほかにて毎週木曜２４：５５から放送開始！Amazon Prime Videoにて日本・海外独占配信！https://t.co/yhXuwKnVuV #BANANAFISH pic.twitter.com/dPSR9XUSoO — TVアニメ「BANANA FISH」公式 (@bananafish_tv) 24 May 2018 Yoshida’s iconic artwork looks excellent in motion here, and I’m really digging the revamped character designs that better fit in with MAPPA’s previous work so far. All of the voice cast is stellar, with Kenji Nojima as Eiji Okumura making a big impression this time around. Shinichi Osawa’s soundtrack is jazzy and groovy, just as it should be, and the new theme song "found & lost" from Survive Said The Prophet sounds heavy but impactful. When the anime was announced, I was initially worried that the sexual content from the manga would be glossed over by the adaptation, but a scene in the PV where Ash Lynx is tied up and loomed over by an older man definitely seems to suggest that the anime is going to adapt these parts, or at least as much as networks will allow them. Moving the setting of the story from 1980s New York to the modern day also doesn’t seem to have affected the tone, but I still wonder what was wrong with the original setting. The original manga is fairly long and complicated, originally being published in 19 volumes and featuring an ensemble story, which means that I don’t think that it could be done justice in a single cour without having to cut much of the story. Thankfully, it was previously announced that the series would be airing for two cours, and although this still won’t allow for a complete adaptation of the manga, I’m sure that this longer runtime will give the writers more room to allow the ensemble nature of the original to shine through in animated form. Kyoto Animation’s Free! director Hiroko Utsumi will be helming the project, which premieres in the late night of July 8. The series will also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video for overseas fans. The original manga follows gang warfare in 1980s New York, as university student Eiji Okamura encounters the beautiful Ash Lynx and is promptly plunged into a world of sex, murder, and betrayal. Many credit the manga with starting the modern boys’ love genre, mostly due to its depiction of male romance, but beyond that, it is a masterful piece of ensemble storytelling that has been waiting for a good anime adaptation for years. Here’s hoping that MAPPA can nail it on this one.|Banana Fish, Akimi Yoshida, Banana Fish Anime
13566|2018-05-25|15:00||http://otaquest.com/studio-khara-hiring/| News | Anime | Studio Khara Steps Up Production for Fourth ‘Evangelion’ Movie | It’s been almost six years since the third Rebuild of Evangelion movie, and it seems as though production is finally back on track for the highly-anticipated fourth and final installment. |It’s been almost six years since the third Rebuild of Evangelion movie, and although director Hideaki Anno took a break from the series to work on Shin Godzilla, it seems as though production is finally back on track for the highly-anticipated fourth and final installment. Evangelion fansite Eva Monkey picked up the news earlier this week that Hideaki Anno’s studio, Studio Khara, put out a recruiting call on their official website for new animating staff. If you look further into the details of the job listing, you’ll find that stated very clearly that these new staff will be working on the new Rebuild movie, which is the first real confirmation we’ve had that production has started in earnest since Anno announced that he would be returning to the project after Shin Godzilla. The director recently celebrated his 58th birthday, but it doesn’t seem like he’s ready to settle down just yet. Furthermore, the studio is looking for animation staff of all types - digital, 3DCG and VFX - which suggests that they are gathering manpower for the actual production of the movie, now that they have presumably finished pre-production. Most of the job listings have a deadline of around the end of June, which suggests that production will pick up around the end of July or the beginning of August, provided that they find enough staff. I’m sure they won’t have a problem - I think you’d be hard-pressed to find a Japanese animator who wouldn’t want to work on an Evangelion project. Even so, don’t get too excited - it took Khara around two years of work to finish up the other movies if you don’t count the pre-production problems that delayed the release of Evangelion 3.0. So even if the new movie is moving towards principal production now, it definitely won’t reach theatres until at least 2020. With that being said, perhaps that's the most fitting time for the film to release. Tokyo will hold the Olympics during the Summer, allowing visitors to the city at that time to appreciate both Japan’s sporting talent as well as their artistic talent. Here’s hoping that everything proceeds smoothly.|Khara, Studio Khara, Gainax, Hideaki Anno, Khara Hiring

13558|2018-05-24|15:00||http://otaquest.com/detective-conan-box-office-hit-six-year/| News | Anime | ‘Detective Conan’ Beats Own Box Office Record for the Sixth Year Running | Gosho Aoyama’s long-running mystery series ‘Detective Conan’ is already an iconic property in Japan and East Asia in general, but it has been doing exceptionally well at the box office with its feature-length films recently. |Gosho Aoyama’s long-running mystery series ‘Detective Conan’ is already an iconic property in Japan and East Asia in general, but it has been doing exceptionally well at the box office with its feature-length films recently; this year beating it’s box office record once more for six years in a row. The news came in after six weeks at the box office that the twenty-second movie in the franchise, ‘Zero’s Executioner,’ had earned a whopping 7.2 billion yen, beating the previous movie’s record of 6.87 billion. The franchise has been on an upward trend for years, beginning with movie seventeen - ‘Private Eye in the Distant Sea’ - which beat the previous movie by a fair margin. From then on, box office receipts for the movies begin to climb gradually, only to jump up by a billion yen when movie twenty, ‘The Darkest Nightmare,’ earned 6.33 billion at the box office. The series has always been an important property in modern Japanese popular culture, but this recent success is surprising, to say the least. Just looking at the length of the series seems to contradict the movies’ apparent success at the box office; the manga recently reached 1000 chapters, and the anime recently reached its 900th episode - surely the sheer length and multitude of content needed to get into the series is daunting, and would thus put people off the franchise’s movies? The producers of previous movies were seemingly aware of that fact and chose to develop them as stand-alone adventures that anyone could enjoy no matter how knowledgeable they were about the series. But precisely because of this, and other factors, these early films weren't particularly good - in fact, many fans considered the movies as not canon up until recently because of how poorly put together they were in comparison with the main series. The writing did slowly improve over the years in response to this criticism, eventually culminating in 'Dimensional Sniper’ (movie eighteen) and ‘Sunflowers of Inferno’ (movie nineteen) being particularly excellent stand-alone adventures, but there was still something missing. It was only once the movies began to cover more of the actual canon, starting with The Darkest Nightmare (movie twenty), that the series began to break it’s box office records by larger margins. Nightmare explored a mystery pertaining to the Black Organisation, the main antagonists of the series, featuring all of the members that had been introduced up until that point, as well as a multitude of CIA agents - something I can’t imagine a casual viewer understanding without prior knowledge. Even so, tying the movie into the canon and allowing the movies to move the plot forward, even if only slightly, ultimately gives them much more meaning to hardcore fans - the type of fans who will buy multiple tickets. But the cementation of Conan into the Japanese popular consciousness - even if only the base elements of the series - also means that it has become much easier for Japanese theatergoers to understand the basics of each film, even if they have never watched or read it. You’d be hard-pressed to find a Japanese person who isn’t aware of Conan’s trademark voice-changing bowtie or his classic catchphrase, “there is only one truth” - which only reinforces the series’ iconic place in popular culture. It's because of all this accumulated that it's not very surprising then that ‘Zero’s Executioner’ would quickly beat the previous movie’s record. It features one of the most popular characters right now in Amuro Toru, and also heavily links in with the current canon of the series as well as foreshadows future events. Furthermore, theatergoers feel much more comfortable in going to see the film without any prior knowledge because of Conan’s iconic place in pop culture. I personally found the film to be very refreshing, pushing the franchise and particularly the feature film series in new directions with its thriller-based plot instead of a straight-forward mystery. That being said, it remains to be seen whether the franchise can once more top it’s box office record next year. Kaitou Kid is back in what seems to be a standalone mystery, which ought to satisfy the fandom as well as draw in more casual viewers, but considering that the franchise has always done best at the box office when tying its films into the canon, much remains to be seen.|Detective Conan, Case Closed, Gosho Aoyama, Zero’s Executioner, Detective Conan: Zero's Executioner

Ever since the original 1971, Hayao Miyazaki-led anime series, Yuji Ohno has been providing iconic jazz-influenced themes for the series that have given it a unique aural flavor that can’t be found anywhere else. Yuji Ohno eventually went on to form the ‘Lupintic Six’ with many of his former cooperators from ‘YOU & THE EXPLOSION BAND’ in 2016 to focus on his tracks for Lupin, and this has only since improved the music for the series. So with all that being said, you’re definitely not going to want to miss an opportunity to see them live. Luckily, their annual Lupin concert, this time titled ‘Lupin! Lupin!! Lupinissimo!!!’, is going to be streamed live on Nico Nico Douga. The concert takes place on May 26 at the Kinema Club in Tokyo, and the show begins at 5:30 JST. If you happen to be in Tokyo, then tickets are purchased at the door, so feel free to make your way down and enjoy a night of Lupin goodness. While Ohno and his band play classic, as well as newer tracks, a screen above them will play clips from the various anime series, allowing you to be fully immersed in the Lupin atmosphere. Ohno’s long career as a session musician, jazz instrumentalist, and composer gives him a level of skill that can’t be found elsewhere in the anime industry, and I’m sure that this will be reflected in an excellent performance on the night. Furthermore, to celebrate one of Yuji Ohno’s concert coming to Nico Nico for the first time, last year’s ‘Lupin! Lupin!! Lupin!!!’ concert will also be streamed the day before, on May 25 - meaning that anybody not familiar with Ohno’s music can get quickly up to speed. I’ll certainly be watching both nights - I wouldn’t miss Lupin content for the world.

Commonly known as a popular Japanese soul food, udon is typically served in fast food restaurants as a quick, cheap dish. With that being said, at Menki Yashima, their udon-making technique has been perfected over 80 years, making for something far from your ordinary bowl of noodles. Menki Yashima takes pride in their handmade Sanuki Udon, which is a square-shape type of wheat flour noodle originating in the Kagawa prefecture. They opened their first shop 80 years ago in Shibuya, and from what I can assume, they’ve been decorating the shop more and more ever since the very first day. When you walk into the restaurant, it’s heavily reminiscent of the secondhand store and collectors haven Mandarake. The walls are colorfully decorated with nostalgic toys, figures, posters, and various types of merchandise, dating back well before the turn of the century. Among many other types of memorabilia, there is even a pair of big, angry-eyebrow Rilakkuma plushies dangling awkwardly from the ceiling, right above the window where you can watch the chef hand-make the noodles you’re about to eat. The noodles are delightfully chewy and are complemented perfectly by the soup broth and small sides that you can order. Tempura is also on the menu, which seems to be a must-have when it comes to having Japanese noodle dishes. When we went to the Maruyamacho shop, there was a little bit of a wait to receive our food, but it was well worth it. Our recommendation is the Beef Udon, which will run you 830 yen. Not bad for a soulfully handcrafted dish. You absolutely have to eat at Menki Yashima if you happen to be in Tokyo, and you can do so at either of their two locations in Shibuya. But, you’d better get there early, as they’re only open for a few hours a day, and will close shop for the day if they run out of stock. They just happen to be that popular.

13548|2018-05-23|15:00||http://otaquest.com/steam-visual-novel-issue/| News | Anime , Manga , Games | Valve's Ultimatum on Adult Content Jeopardizes Visual Novels in the West | The emergence of visual novels into the gaming mainstream has been a joy to watch over recent years, but Valve’s recent actions towards certain developers has brought into question the future of the industry in the West. |The emergence of visual novels into the gaming mainstream has been a joy to watch over recent years, but Valve’s recent actions towards certain developers has brought into question the future of the industry in the West. Developers have always been left in the dark as to whether adult content is allowed on Steam, with Valve’s policy being very unclear and at times contradictory. There were some games such as Huniepop that featured sexually explicit content and were able to be published on the platform, yet, others were forced to make changes. This problem was never as widespread as it had the potential to be, as it was always the perceived wisdom that games with sexual content wouldn’t sell well in the West. It was largely because of this belief that many of the visual novels that first began to appear on Steam, such as planetarian and Nekopara Vol. 1, did not feature sexual content - even if the original Japanese version did. With that being said, the fan demand for adult content was satisfied through patches that developers often provided themselves, downloadable via third party websites such as SourceForge. Many high profile visual novel releases benefited from this, such as the seminal science-fiction visual novel Muv Luv, which was followed up sometime after release with an official 18+ patch. Links to such patches were often posted in public, on the Steam forums, which further muddled the boundaries on the issue. Therefore when Valve contacted many developers, including industry leaders MangaGamer and Sekai Project, last week with an ultimatum - remove the adult content from your game within two weeks or it will be deleted from the platform - many were surprised, to say the least. Beyond a move last year to prevent developers posting links to 18+ patches on Steam forums, Valve had never before attempted to address the long-standing issue or clarify it’s policy on the matter. Following outrage from many developers, Valve has now seemingly backtracked on their ultimatum, and will now manually review the games of the developers it has contacted. Even so, the company has not yet announced publicly any move to clarify their policy on adult content, only meaning that the problem will only persist, only that now developers are aware that their future on the platform can suddenly be put into question without any prior warning from the company - meaning that many are now reconsidering their options in terms of the distribution of their games. The recent exodus of visual novels to DRM-free site GOG.com is a clear showcase of this. MangaGamer’s localization of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni series and Sekai Project’s Fault and Sunrider series suddenly appeared on the platform at a discount yesterday, and I’m sure that many developers will be considering following suit. This doesn’t mean that visual novel developers are planning to forsake Steam immediately, but that they are exploring options other than it - putting into doubt the future of visual novels on Steam in the long-term. Frankly, Valve’s confusing and contradictory policy has long risked causing a scandal such as this. The brash action that the company took, although now reversed, has shown that they aren’t on top of the situation or sensitive to the needs of visual novel developers, which has rightly shaken the confidence of those who choose to publish on Steam. This damage seems irreversible without a clear change in policy, and will almost definitely change the landscape of visual novel development and publishing in the future.|Manga Gamer, Steam, Valve, Visual Novels, VN, Steam VN
13547|2018-05-23|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-64-mini-trademarked/| News | Games | Potential 'Nintendo 64 Mini' Trademarked by Nintendo | Nintendo has begun trademarking a number of N64 related properties earlier this week, hinting that the companies next mini-console might be just around the corner. |It's that time of the year again where we're seeing video game rumors flying left and right, but today's revelation of Nintendo filing a number of Nintendo 64 related trademarks might just hold its ground. Application for an N64 trademark which was filed by Nintendo includes snippets of information on game software, controllers, and the actual console. What this points to, of course, is the likelihood of Nintendo coming out soon with the announcement of a new Nintendo 64 Classic Edition. Easily some of Nintendo's most-hyped products of recent times, their Classic Edition series of micro-consoles have played a critical role in introducing new and old gamers alike to the retro bliss of the past. It was during the month of November 2016 that we were first introduced to the NES Classic Edition, and then again in September 2017 that we saw the SNES Classic Edition for the very first time. Now, just under a year later, we're getting closer and closer to the likely timeframe for the release of Nintendo's next Classic Edition console. With E3 2018 just around the corner, we're almost certain to see some big announcements from Nintendo; the Nintendo 64 Classic Edition likely to be a big one of them, next to Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo Switch. While there is a lot of reasons to be excited about the possibility of a Nintendo 64 Classic Edition, there's also a lot of reason for concern. Perhaps most importantly, what is Nintendo planning on doing about the plethora of licensing issues surrounding some of the console's biggest games? Developers such as Rare, the group behind 007: Goldeneye, Banjo Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, and countless other titles certainly aren't going to be an easy fetch, especially given their acquisition by direct competitor Microsoft. Until the announcement, we'll just have to keep our eyes sharply peeled. If anything comes up in the coming weeks, we'll be sure to keep you updated.|Nintendo 64, N64, Nintendo 64 Mini, N64 Mini, Nintendo

Instead, this package is aimed at families with multiple children who have no need for an additional dock or connectors, bringing the price of the unit down to 24,980 yen ($226). With that being said, for users who don't particularly fancy plugging their Switch into the television to play, this could just be a cheaper solution for you. The package, which can only be purchased online via Nintendo Japan's store, includes the Switch device, as well as your standard pair of Joy-Con and Joy-Con straps. All of these are fully color-customizable, allowing you to get creative with whatever color pairings you want for your Joy-Con and straps. That is, in other words, basically everything you'll need to get going with the Switch other than a charging unit. For that, you'll need to pick up your own USB-C charging cable that can be used with the device. So after losing out on the TV dock, HDMI cable, AC adapter, and Joy-Con grip, would you be interested in picking up one of these standalone Switch packages? There is currently no word about a release of the package outside of Japan, but we'll be sure to keep you updated if any further information is announced. |Nintendo, Switch, Nintendo Switch
13543|2018-05-23|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/playstation-4-final-phase-life-cycle/| News | N/A | Sony's PlayStation 4 Announced to be in Final Stages of its Life Cycle | During a recent investors presentation hosted by SIE's CEO John Kodera earlier this week, it was revealed that the PlayStation 4 is officially entering the final phase of its life cycle. |Just under five years since the initial launch of Sony's massively-popular PlayStation 4 home console around the globe, details were shared during a recent investors day held by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) CEO John Kodera in Tokyo earlier this week that the device is entering the "final phase of its life cycle." While this doesn't mean that Sony plans to drop the PlayStation 4 off the face of this planet any time soon, this does mean that things will be slowing down a little leading into March 2021, the planned ending date for Sony's current management plan period. Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO John Kodera noted during the investors day that the company expects ongoing revenue flow from user subscription services to keep the company afloat while the console faces fewer sales leading out of its life cycle. Additionally, Sony Interactive Entertainment plans to strengthen first-party IP support during the end of the life cycle to assist with the upcoming expectancy of a decline in hardware sales leading into 2019. By March 31, 2018, Sony detailed that over 79.8 million PlayStation 4 units had been sold globally. Additionally, Sony's online infrastructure, the PlayStation Network, has been revealed to be actively hosting over 80 million active users, up from 70 million just one year ago. With this, it was further revealed that Sony Interactive Entertainment no longer looks at unit sales of the PlayStation 4, but rather the individual subscriptions and active users of the PlayStation Network. While the announcement certainly was sudden, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise for anybody; given the average life expectancy for a PlayStation console is around 6-7 years. What this does put us on track for, however, is the eventual announcement of the PlayStation 5 (or whatever it ends up being called), which would likely be released around 2020 given Sony's ongoing track record. While no particular details were shared regarding the next-generation console, we're sure we'll start seeing various bits of information popping up over the next couple of years. Sony Interactive Entertainment America CEO Shawn Layden already detailed that the company won't be making any hardware announcements during E3 2018, however, so maybe scratch any hopes of a reveal from that.

Did you enjoy ‎Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira, Minetarō Mochizuki’s Dragon Head, or all the mysterious hallways and special abilities in Kazuma Kondou’s Deadman Wonderland? Independent animator Kojo Tanno is creating brief clips that capture such aesthetic with a thick air of mystery, all from his home in Nagasaki. I really don’t feel as if I can properly put his works into words that will do them justice, so check out this short video: pic.twitter.com/7YDNsYUyYi — KOJO TANNO (@TANNOKOJO) 15 February 2018 A Google search for Tanno will yields mostly ambiguous results, including long-since archived articles by sites such as Crunchyroll and Anime News Network covering his video “VIEW” from 2012. There are quite large gaps between his uploads, with his first Youtube upload, “SAYONARA, WATASHI...” being from well over 9 years ago to date. Since then, however, Kojo Tanno has uploaded a total of 14 videos to his YouTube channel, his most popular being “JOSHI ni tsuite” (Regarding Girls) that holds its ground at nearly a million views: With all that being said, however, it's his recent video “QUARANTINE” that has been making its rounds on Twitter as of late. Since its initial posting this past February, I've been digging deeper and deeper into his works, leading me to his recently launched Patreon. Contributors are granted the ability to see his filmmaking progress, ask questions, and buy exclusive merch that he makes available only to patrons. With his Patreon, Tanno aims to gain funds to produce his own film, something that longtime fans have probably been waiting for almost 10 years now. Kojo Tanno’s works often have non-conclusive endings that leave your mind to fill in the rest of the story. The symbolism in each video is left to the viewer to contemplate. He’s definitely a mysterious guy, and I’m personally really excited to see where he takes the rest of “QUARANTINE”.

Contains spoilers for Hunter x Hunter. A new collaboration piercing was unveiled today, and it’s not what you’d expect, like a replica of Chrollo Lucifer’s earrings, or even Kurapika’s for that matter. Instead, the iconic and heartbreaking adult form of Gon Freecss - playfully called ‘Gon-san - which he transforms into after giving into his rage and trauma following the revelation that Kite cannot be brought back following despite Neferpitou’s healing powers, is now available to hang on your earlobes. Coming in at around 3000 yen for the normal version and 10,000 yen for the ‘high-end model,’ the earring highlights Gon’s extremely long hair in this form - making the piercing very long, around 90mm in fact. Depending on how your ears are pierced and your personal preference, you can also choose between an earring and piercing design for the part that attaches to the earlobe. Wearing just one of the unique ear pieces looks great, as shown below, but you can also buy a pair of them. Pre-orders will be open until August 5 on Premium Bandai’s website. Seeing such a heartbreaking and iconic part of the series turned into an accessory was surprising to hear at first, but after seeing images of the design, I must admit that it definitely makes for a rather unique accessory. That being said, this isn’t the first time that we’ve seen Gon’s adult form turned into apparel, as he also made an appearance on one of the Jump 50th Anniversary Uniqlo collaboration shirts. These shirts have quickly made themselves at home in my closet, so I suppose wearing an earring of Gon-san isn’t a step that much further removed - even if it is a little bit close to home.|Hunter x Hunter, Togashi Yoshihiro, Manga, Shonen Jump, Hunter x Hunter merch

Let's take a look at the music video below: Released within the nine-track album "Attune / Detune" that released earlier this year, "One Temperature" takes MONDO GROSSO's signature sound to fresh places, something that rung especially true across the whole album. I couldn't picture the track with vocals from anyone else, either, as Big-O lets the lyrics flow in a manner only he can execute so well. There's little room for error on this track, as well as the rest of the album, and this one is definitely going to be bopping for days on end. |mondo grosso, One Temperature, Big O, Big-O, Attune / Detune

The initial pixelated imagery left a lot to the imagination, but it wasn't until earlier today that we finally got our first real look at the RS-0 Sonic and RS-0 Dr. Eggman sneakers, as well as their release date and price point. Set to hit the streets on June 5, 2018, at a total cost of $130 USD, the sneakers are a mostly subtle throwback to a couple of gamings most iconic characters. Initial impressions of the sneakers are scattered and mixed, with some in love with the inspired designs and colorways, while others are finding faults in the "high price point" and material choices. While I sit on the positive side of the fence when it comes to this one, I will admit I'm not exactly jumping at the initial images of the materials, though that could change when I actually get to see a pair of these sneakers in person. I can't picture everyone picking these up as everyday pieces, but I'm sure any fan of the series could incorporate them quite well.

The way that Okabe, Mayuri, Daru et al. are situated so well in the locale has gone a long way in making the area an integral part of the series. This, along with the excellent storytelling and character writing, has been an excellent advertisement for the otaku hub since the original game’s release to critical praise in 2009. For me as well, experiencing the same locale as the characters of Steins;Gate and being able to feel the spirit of the series in the area is a key part of why I love it so much. That being said, with the new Steins;Gate 0 anime beginning it’s broadcast this season, it seems only fitting that the whole city mobilizes to advertise it. And so it has - not just with billboards on the Sofmap and Sega buildings, but with a multitude of collaboration events and goods also. Running until May 31, the first major collaboration is with the AR app “Butai Meguri,” which will be using Akihabara as it’s playing field for a new Steins;Gate themed adventure titled “OPERATION;HEPHAISTOS.” This is actually the second time the app has crossed over with the series, previously running an event in Saitama. By using the app and visiting iconic Akihabara locations such as Chuo-Dori and Animate, players will receive a free badge set featuring Kurisu and Maho. There are only eight locations to visit, and anyone familiar with the area will probably be able to do it in no time, so it definitely seems worth giving a go. During the time of this event, there are also plenty of food-related events scheduled. Firstly, Cafe Mailish is holding a special event to in honor of the “Supa Hacka” himself, Daru. It will feature a special themed menu as well as a gallery for the loveable otaku himself. An odd choice perhaps, but not when you realize that Daru’s birthday was actually on May 19 - so I’d like to think that we’re throwing the often unappreciated Daru a birthday party. Kanazawa-style curry chain GOGO Curry will also be serving up a special collaboration curry and clear file in their Chuo-Dori store. The curry utilizes fried chicken - an ode to Mayuri’s own love for “Juicy Karaage Number One” - which is in turn drizzled with a yellow sauce, named “Gelsauce” after the “gelbananas” of the first series. I was able to sample the dish, and as usual, the curry was excellent, but what made it even better was the clear file that came with it. The humorous design features Okabe holding some GOGO curry and Kurisu with one of their signature forks. This collaboration curry will set you back 1200 yen, a little expensive but definitely worth it. Even if you’re just walking around Akihabara, not aiming to participate in any of the above events, it seems almost impossible to escape the series at the minute - many of the vending machines have been adorned with Steins;Gate characters, Dr. Pepper is doing a crossover with the series, and even without any explicit reference to the series, it seems as though Steins;Gate has once more entered into the soul of Akihabara. As it should be. For more details on collaboration events, check out the official website. |Steins;Gate, Steins Gate, Akihabara, Akiba, Otaku

Via Streaming | In a weird turn of events, Capcom earlier today announced that Resident Evil 7: Biohazard will be coming to the Nintendo Switch in Japan via a streaming service that will have you playing on the cloud. |In a weird turn of events, Capcom announced earlier today that they're bringing Resident Evil 7: Biohazard to Nintendo Switch in Japan on May 24, 2018, but only a version of the game that has to be streamed via their cloud servers. If that wasn't odd enough, beyond the fact that you're streaming the game, at no point will you actually "own" the title, with Capcom requiring players buy 180 day passes at the price of 2,000 yen every half-a-year. Those interested in playing the game will be able to simply go to the JP Nintendo eShop and download the 45mb Resident Evil cloud application, beginning the initial 15-minute trial before deciding if they want to purchase the full game pass. Included in the cloud version of the game, players will have access to all available DLC including Banned Footage Vol. 1 & 2, End of Zoe, and Not A Hero. Players are recommended to either have a 5ghz router or be using ethernet to enjoy a stable experience, though internet speeds will definitely be a major factor. While it isn't particularly a standard in the West, nor in most of the world just yet, cloud streamed games have unfortunately been gaining more and more traction over here in Japan. Just recently we saw the launch of Phantasy Star Online 2 for the Nintendo Switch running on a similar cloud streaming platform. In my personal experience with that title, in particular, the game was riddled with lag and delays which effectively rendered it unplayable for the better part. We'll definitely have to see how Resident Evil 7 performs, especially if it is following that same path. While there's currently no official word of a Western release of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard on Nintendo Switch in the West, and we quite strongly doubt there ever will be in this format, we'll be sure to keep you up to date if any information does arise.

In preparation for the story that's about to unfold before our very eyes, Adult Swim has begun streaming the first English dubbed trailer for the series. The first entry into two brand new FLCL stories, FLCL Progressive follows 14-year-old schoolgirl Hidomi as her life takes a turn for the weird as we're taken through the wild ride that is adolescence. Let's take a look at the new trailer below: Set to premiere on Adult Swim's Toonami block on June 2nd, 12:00 am (Eastern Time), FLCL Progressive will consist of a total of six episodes. Viewers in Japan will have it a little differently, however, with the show set to release as a single film that will actually come out after the other story, FLCL Alternative. Reasoning and structure behind this are currently unknown, but that could make for an interesting twist amongst international discussion. Toonami describes the series below: FLCL Progressive tells the story of 14-year-old Hidomi, her classmate Ide, and two otherworldly beings, "Jinyu" and "Haruha Raharu," who are determined to unlock their hidden potential. Mixed up in this is an all-powerful force known as "ATOMSK," a gorgeous vintage car... and a certain Vespa Scooter. For many international anime fans, the original FLCL acted as a cornerstone in their developmental years alongside the anime medium. Now over 18-years since the original series aired on television, we're given the opportunity to expose an entirely new audience to such an important series in fresh and exciting ways.

Originally launched in 2014 while offering the ability for two animators to live in Asagaya, Tokyo, the project has since massively expanded over the years, with the intent of housing 11 animators with the 2018 round of funding. With the consistently high rent prices of Tokyo, coupled with the majority of anime studios being based in the capital city, it can be a difficult juggle for young animators who hope to break into the industry. In a recent posting, Animator Supporters shared that the monthly payment for young animators can be as little as 30,000 yen during their first year. In a 2009 survey of 728 samples, it was found that the average salary for an animator in their 20s is around 90,000 yen ($810 USD), making their annual salary roughly 1,100,00 yen ($9,900 USD). Between housing, food, transport, and the other costs of Tokyo's lifestyle, it's easy to see where the problem lies. While housing has always been the primary goal of the Animator Supporters project, the NPO is looking at new opportunities for those living in the dorms to sustain themselves. With their latest funding round, the group has announced that they will create their own original anime shorts as a bid to raise money that can be entirely used between the animators themselves. The first anime short will be directed by a former Animator Supporters alumni who was previously housed by the organization. Following this, there will also be a community-driven short where the project will offer the opportunity to create the storyboard for the anime of your dreams, and if selected, it will be animated and brought to life by the team. There's a lot to digest with this year's backing round, so you'll definitely want to head over to the official GoGetFunding page for further information, here. We're definitely excited to see what comes of this all, and hope to see the fruit of the project's labor in the very near future! Wishing you the best of luck in 2018 too, Animator Supporters. |Animator Dormitory Project, Jun Sugawara, animator dormitory, 2018 Animator Dormitory Project,

Well, as it turns out, they really wouldn't be waiting long at all, with the game set to be coming out on the same day in both North America and Europe, as announced by Capcom. Originally released to poor reception on the PlayStation 2 due to how late the game came out during the console's lifecycle, it wouldn't be until years later when the HD remaster first released on PlayStation 3 that it received more mainstream attention. With the Nintendo Switch port of the game, players will be offered the use of both touchscreen and joystick motion control to handle various elements of the game. Now available on just about every console, with the Nintendo Switch being the next to join that list, those of you that haven't checked the game out are absolutely implored to.

The ride thrusts those who dare embark on a full 360-degree battle with attacking Angels as they rush through locations at ultra-high speeds. Originally launched last year at the theme park as a temporary attraction, the ride would later be re-used as the currently ongoing Final Fantasy ride which will again switch back. Dubbed under the name Evangelion: You Can (Not) Survive, a clever play on the title structure of the ongoing rebuild films, the ride amassed an outstanding 99% approval rating from those who partook last Summer. For those unfamiliar with XR experiences, it's basically a glorified way of saying you're strapped into a rollercoaster with VR goggles strapped to your head. That being said, don't confuse this ride for your everyday smartphone goggle VR experience - things are going to get intense. Operated as part of the ongoing Cool Japan initiative, fans have been able to experience series such as Evangelion, Sailor Moon, Detective Conan, Final Fantasy, and more in new and exciting ways. Oh, and by the way, yes the incredible Eva unit headpiece popcorn bucket is going back, and no I'm not going to miss it this time.

13514|2018-05-18|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/godzilla-city-battle-edge-2nd-trailer/| News | Anime | 'Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle' Anime Receives Second Trailer | Animated film 'Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle' has received its second trailer earlier today following the release of the film across Japan on May 18. |With the launch of the latest Godzilla animated film across Japan earlier today, Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle, the official website for the film began streaming their second trailer to drum up the hype. Following up from Polygon Pictures first CG animated Godzilla film, Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters, which released across Japan in 2017, the latest film pits Godzilla against Mechagodzilla. Additionally, the new trailer previews the film's theme song, "The Sky Falls" by XAI. Released across Japan on May 18, 2018, the second entry into the animated Godzilla universe is described (quite extensively) down below: By the advent of the 21st century, much of humanity was dead, having been trampled over by a new master, Godzilla. A select few among mankind took to the stars in a spacefaring vessel called the Aratrum in search of “the promised land,” the planet Tau-e that could sustain human life. But the migration plan fails, and the remnants of the human race decide to return to Earth. But the distortions in space-time and the distance traveled means that mankind is returning to a completely changed Earth some 20,000 years later. The returnees, led by hero Haruo, prepare to take the fight to Godzilla based on a strategy that has been 20 years in the making. Carried out with the help of two alien species, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, the humans succeed in defeating Godzilla in a costly battle to the death. But the victory is short-lived. Rising from the depths of the planet is a new breed of monster, dubbed “Godzilla Earth.” Evolving for 20,000 years, the creature stands 300 meters high, weighs over 100,000 tons and wields such overwhelmingly destructive power that Haruo and company have no choice but to run for their lives. Coming to Haruo's rescue, however, is Miana, a member of an aboriginal tribe called the Houtua. They are the first humanoid people the returnees have encountered. Could they descend from humans? “Our tribal god was destroyed by Godzilla. All that we have left are these eggs. Anyone who has tried to fight or resist him has been drowned in fire,” the tribespeople say to Haruo, who responds with: “This is our last hope of recovering our home.” Meanwhile, Bilusaludo commander, Galu-gu is elated to discover that the Houtua tribe's arrowheads are made of a nanometal or a self-sustaining metal. It had been developed in the 21st century as an “anti-Godzilla” killer weapon deployed at their decisive battle fought at the foot of Mt. Fuji, but had been destroyed before it could be activated in the form of a “Mecha-Godzilla.” The nanometal was its base substance, and proof that the manufacturing plant can still be used. As someone who has always been a fan of the original Godzilla and fellow Kaiju films, yet still, someone who is yet to see the direction Polygon Pictures took these films, I'm certainly interested in checking them out sometime soon. Those interested in checking out the film should definitely head to the official website for further information.|Godzilla, Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle, City on the Edge of Battle, Godzilla Anime, Polygon Pictures

To keep the game alive with a free to play model, the game will have embedded ads within. With that being said, however, advertisements can be disabled with a one-time $1.99 fee. At such a low price, you might be surprised to hear just how fully-fledged the title is, rocking a total of 125 stages and 6 worlds within. Easily one of my childhood defining titles, Super Monkey Ball is a game I can only hope to see more of in the not-so-distant future.

13504|2018-05-17|18:00||http://otaquest.com/cowboy-bebop-cafe/| News | Anime | Eat Like a Bounty Hunter With the Cast of ‘Cowboy Bebop’ in Upcoming Cafe | It’s been twenty years since the broadcast of Shinichiro Watanabe’s legendary science-fiction series Cowboy Bebop, and Animate Café is celebrating by running a special café based on the cuisine of the series. |It’s been twenty years since the broadcast of Shinichiro Watanabe’s legendary science-fiction series Cowboy Bebop, and Animate Café is celebrating by running a special café based on the cuisine of the series. Now, if you’ve seen the series, you might be a bit apprehensive - after all, most of the time the characters suffer in poverty, only motivated to do their jobs as bounty hunters so that they can eat the next day. And when they can’t find a job, they have to make do with what they have - which is often the bare minimum of ingredients. Even so, it looks like Animate have actually managed to craft some dishes that look really appetizing. The obvious stand-out food item is the “Green pepper and beef stir fry, no meat” dish that Spike and Jet argue about in the first episode. Even though there’s no meat, it certainly doesn’t look unappetizing, and it’s probably still far better than anything I could make. Other dishes include the “Mushroom Samba” burger that takes its inspiration from the magic mushrooms of episode seventeen, and the “Ganymede seafood pizza,” which may or may not be made from the endangered Ganymede sea rat of episode four. Each character also gets their own themed drink, and with alcohol such a key part of the series, Animate have paid extra special attention to their drinks menu this time around. The “Spike Spiegel” is an Old Fashioned cocktail that comes with a gun-shaped chocolate and mixed nuts; the “Jet Black” is a Cowboy cocktail; the “Faye Valentine” is a classy martini; and the “Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV” is a non-alcoholic Cinderella cocktail - after all, she’s just a child. Other drinks include the “Prairie Oyster,” the ‘hangover cure’ that Spike drank in episode seven, and I’m really curious to see if it tastes as bad as he makes it out to be. With regards to food and drink, it’s worth noting that there are two different times of service which will affect the composition of the menu. Lunch service, which runs from 11 am to 4 pm, will focus more on lunch dishes such as hamburgers, whereas the night service (5 pm to 9:30 pm) will focus on dishes that go well with alcoholic drinks. As a result, some dishes may change portion sizes and price depending on the time of day, so be sure to check the menu beforehand. There are also some seriously cool goods on offer, the best of which has to be the exclusive Zippo lighter with a Spike Spiegel design on it, which won’t actually release until August later this year. The other goods are available to buy in the store immediately though, such as a Swordfish II neck-tie, engraved whiskey tumblers, and cork coasters. To be honest, it’s going to be very hard to resist buying everything, because Bebop was never the type of show that lent itself to merchandising, and thus the number of goods from the show is very limited. So if the thought of sharing in the poverty cuisine of the Bebop crew has your stomach rumbling, or if you simply want to celebrate twenty years of the legendary show, then good news - the café is now open until June 10 at the Akihabara branch of Animate Café in Tokyo, and the Nihonbashi branch in Osaka. You don’t need a reservation either, so what are you waiting for? For more details on the menu, be sure to check out the official website. |Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe, Cowboy Bebop Cafe, Animate
13503|2018-05-17|17:00||http://otaquest.com/studio-trigger-hiring/| News | Anime | Studio TRIGGER Hiring On a Large Scale for Next Year | Studio TRIGGER is hiring as we enter the latter half of the current year, opening the doors of opportunity to a new wave of budding creatives. |Is there any studio nearly as cool as Studio TRIGGER? Formed from the ashes of the equally eminent GAINAX, the studio has gone from producing zero-budget shorts such as Inferno Cop to blockbuster TV series such as Darling in the Franxx in merely seven years since it was founded in 2011. Even so, the studio is far from settling down and taking stock of their frankly unprecedented achievements in such a short space of time, as a recent long list of job openings posted today on their official website suggests. The majority of the jobs are based in their Tokyo studio, which isn’t surprising considering that they do most of their business in the Tokyo area. The only opening not in Tokyo is for their Fukushima studio, where they need several in-between animators. Beyond that minor opening, however, there are some seriously big jobs up for grabs at the Tokyo studio, such as a production director, production assistant, and assistant director, as well as in-between animators - making for five postings altogether. What makes these job openings interesting is that they all mostly begin in the next financial year, which will usually take place from April to March every year in Japan. TRIGGER previously announced at Anime Expo, along with the currently airing Darling in the Franxx, a new collaboration between the Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill duo Kazuki Nakashima and Hiroyuki Imaishi in the form of Promare, which fans were rightly ecstatic about. As of the time of writing, that project doesn’t have a synopsis nor a definite airing date, but the fact that all of these jobs are scheduled to start in the next financial year means that it’s probably safe to assume that the studio will be pressing on with pre-production for the project around that time, and in order to do that, they need some extra hands on board. I wouldn’t be surprised if the decision to hire more in-between animators for the Fukushima studio was also made with an eye to the future project. That being said, there is one job that seems unrelated to future projects - a part-time job doing marketing at the Tokyo studio. Applicants will be coordinating with merchandising and producing marketing materials for SNS platforms, and they’re asking for people under thirty. So, does anyone fancy working at Studio TRIGGER?|Studio TRIGGER, Trigger, Anime jobs, TRIGGER Hiring
13502|2018-05-17|16:00||http://otaquest.com/japan-is-running-out-of-whiskey/| News | N/A | Suntory Suspends Sale of Iconic Malts Due to Excess Demand | Whiskey giant Suntory announced on May 15 that they would be temporarily halting the sale of their flagship malts and whiskeys, the 12-year “Hakushuu” and the 17 years “Hibiki,” from June and September onwards respectively. |Japanese whiskey has been riding a resurgent wave of popularity since the late 2000s, but now it seems like domestic distillers are having real problems satisfying the demand. To the dismay of many whiskey lovers, whiskey giant Suntory announced on May 15 that they would be temporarily halting the sale of their flagship malts, the 12-year “Hakushuu” and the 17-year “Hibiki,” from June and September onwards respectively. Suntory explained that they simply don’t have enough barrels prepared in their distillery to provide enough stock to retailers and distributors due to high demand. As whiskey is aged and fermented over a long period, it isn’t as simple as building more breweries or pouring more money into production, so suspending sale is one of the few choices available to the company. That being said, there have been rumblings of problems in production for a while now. Ever since Suntory acquired the American distiller Jim Beam in 2014, there have been complaints from industry insiders and experts that the company has been focusing more on developing the Jim Beam brand than it has their Japanese brand. Therefore, it wouldn’t be surprising if this lack of adequate barrels at the fermentation stage was due to several oversights on a management level due to the increased focus on Jim Beam. Even so, it’s not all bad news - Suntory’s other malts, such as the Hakushuu 18 year and the Hibiki 21 year, will still be available. This is presumably because of the higher price point of these malts, which means they haven’t been in demand as much as the cheaper, less aged malts. Although we don’t yet know when Suntory’s suspended malts will return, I hope that we hear an announcement soon - after all, there’s nothing I enjoy more than sitting back with a glass of Japanese whiskey and watching some Japanese cartoons, and I'm sure there's a salaryman or two that would probably attest to that too.|Suntory, Hibiki, Hakushuu, Hakushu, Japanese Whiskey, Whisky, Whiskey

Over six years prior to the conception of the now renowned studio, Hayao Miyazaki would join forces with TMS Entertainment once more following his short-lived work on the original Lupin the Third anime series to craft the greatest anime film of all time, Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro. Now that very masterpiece has made its way to Netflix in the United States, making it one of the only Hayao Miyazaki directed films on the streaming platform. While there's always been an air of mystery surrounding the lack of any Studio Ghibli works via the platform, let alone most digital streaming services, it's due to Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro's pre-Ghibli nature that it'd appear that TMS Entertainment gave it their full seal of approval. The film is described below: After a successful robbery leaves famed thief Lupin III and his partner Jigen with nothing but a large amount of fake money, the so called "Goat Bills," he decides to track down the counterfeiter responsible—and steal any other treasures he may find in the Castle of Cagliostro, including the "damsel in distress" he finds imprisoned there. However, as usual, Inspector Zenigata is hot on his trail. Tracking the legendary counterfeits known as "Goat Bills," international thief Arsene Lupin III arrives at the Duchy of Cagliostro. Once there, he nearly rescues a damsel in distress from the Regent's guards. Following his failure, Lupin takes it upon himself to save her from captivity.

This time we're met with the Spring 2018 anime seasons non-sequel map, showcasing the biggest names in anime across the United States as we enter the midway point of the season. There's a clear winner - if that's what you'd call it - and a handful of variety outside of that. So let's take a look at just where your state lies, shall we? See what I meant with that prior statement? Easily one of the best anime of the season, Ashita no Joe's 50th-anniversary project MEGLOBOX is in a realm of its own. Perhaps rivaled in enjoyment only by Lupin the Third: Part 5 in my own taste this season, it's beyond clear that the United States is in love with the boxing series. But whitling it down to simply a boxing series wouldn't do it justice, would it? Within the world of MEGALOBOX, viewers are constantly being blown away by its incredible soundtrack and dark yet real themes, something absent from a lot of other series this season. Following MEGALOBOX on the list is Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online, the anime adaptation of Keiichi Sigsawa's (Kino's Journey) spinoff light novel of the Sword Art Online story. It's probably coming at little surprise to hear that a Sword Art Online title is making the top three on this list, but both old fans and newly-converted fans are seriously raving about this one. From here on the map, however, is where things start to get a little more scattered. Described by Crunchyroll as the smaller anime-viewing states, there's always going to be some diversity here, and that's what's represented on the rest of the map. From Persona 5 the Animation to Umamusume: Pretty Derby, looks like every state has their own thing going on. Out of a total of 58 simulcasts this season from Crunchyroll, how many of these eight have you had a chance to watch?

It comes as no surprise that the group would hold a particular interest in the series, especially given the global influence that Naoko Takeuchi's original manga adaptation would have on the world. What does come as somewhat of a surprise though is the group's official cover of the legendary series theme song "Moonlight Legend," which received a digital release earlier today. Originally performed in 1992 by musical group DALI, the song would later go on to be used as the opening theme for the original Sailor Moon anime, and again reperformed by Moon Lips for the following two seasons. In Dempagumi.inc's cover of the song, we're met with a significantly faster, uptempo version of the original song. This perfectly matches the group's traditional song structure, while also adding a fast-moving breath of fresh air to the song. The group additionally released a dance routine video to accompany the song when they originally showcased it at the Aidolmatsuri 2018, as seen below: Those interested in picking up a copy of the single for themselves can find it available on iTunes internationally, here.

Just about every character has a prop, that's for certain; but whether that character wields a 12-foot tall lollipop or even a couple of water pistols, it's important to know the do's and don'ts of Anime Expo. So in order to inform budding attendees, Anime Expo has uploaded an official Weapon Policy Guide, with the intent of letting cosplayers know in advance just what's acceptable. While the majority of the guide consists of standard policies, there's a couple of additions this year that should be noted. Firstly, the video opens with a reminder of the convention's 15lb & 7ft rule, stating that no prop can weigh more, or have more length than those digits. One of the new changes this year is the banning of prop signs, a move that likely comes to blanket a larger problem, but still a necessary one. Standard rules for guns apply during the 2018 convention, with federal law coming in requiring all replica gun props contain the standard safety markings and indicators, as showcased in the video. There's a myriad of other rules contained within the short 4-minute video that any budding cosplayer is absolutely going to want to study up on before adding the finishing touches to their designs. Those with any questions during the convention are going to want to make their way to the weapons check booth, where they'll need to get their props formally approved prior to entering the convention.

Then, an encounter with the first pro female shogi player, “Hirogane-hime,” turns his life and career upside down as she demands that he become her pupil, in a shogi coming-of-age story by newcomer Satosho Matoyoshi. Given the recent success of similarly-themed shogi manga such as March comes in like a lion, which is currently serialised in Young Animal, has produced two anime series and two live-action movies, as well as the recent The Ryuou's Work is Never Done!, it’s no surprise that Jump would be keen to launch a series that would be able to capitalise on the recent shogi craze in popular culture. Even so, the fact that Jump has gone out of their way to promote this new series before it’s appearance in the magazine is unusual, to say the least. This hopefully means that they are confident about the series’ future and that readers will enjoy it - and just from the preview alone, I’m definitely very excited to check it out when I get a chance.|Shonen Jump, Momiji no Kisetsu, Shogi Manga, Season of Falling Leaves
13490|2018-05-16|14:00||http://otaquest.com/vita-physical-games-cease-production/| News | Games | Farewell, Vita? Production of Physical Games To End in the West, Trouble Afoot in Japan | Learned earlier today, Sony has decided to end production of physical games in Europe and North America for their portable console, the PlayStation Vita. |As Kotaku learned earlier today, Sony has decided to end production of physical games in Europe and North America for their portable console, the PlayStation Vita. But that decision is merely the reflection of numerous flaws in the console that have plagued its success from launch, which is now also coming to affect its performance in the traditionally supportive market of Japan. Firstly, on launch there was a significant amount of confusion regarding the network capabilities of the device, as two models were available to buy, but with only one able to support a 4G SIM card. Many were also not aware that this SIM card was sold separately, and were unsatisfied, to say the least, when they learned that along with the device’s hefty initial price point of $300, they would have to pay for a 4G data plan. Considering that now, you can get a PlayStation 4 for around the same amount, it certainly put people off. What further confounded the problem was the proprietary memory cards. Sony actually decided to manufacture them exclusively in-house, instead of allowing third-party companies to make them. In theory, this would allow them to make memory cards that worked better and faster with the firmware, but in reality, allowed Sony to operate a monopoly on the market as they were able to inflate the prices and exploit the fact that players had no choice but to buy the Sony-made memory cards. Even now, a 32GB Vita memory card will cost you around $60 (down from an initial price of $99), and you can easily get a regular 200GB micro SD card for the same price. These problems, along with many more, meant that the Vita had a rocky start in the West following its launch in 2012, to say the least. It far undersold initial projections, and beyond a couple of first-party developers such as Naughty Dog, failed to get developers on board with the platform. Within a year, it was nearly devoid of exclusives, but it wouldn’t be until 2015 when Sony finally decided to bite the bullet and cease first-party development for the platform altogether. Even with this dire situation in the West, the Vita actually continued to sell well in Japan, in fact being one of the only markets in which the device was turning a profit for some time. It’s predecessor, the PSP, also sold well in Japan, so it’s no surprise that Japanese consumers were equally eager to support the new device in Sony’s portable line-up. Yet, the very same things that drew Japanese consumers to the console itself, mainly being great third-party support from Japanese developers and the market’s general preference for gaming on the go, have now come to adversely affect the device’s performance. With the rapid advance in smartphone technology, the PS Vita’s hardware specifications increasingly look and perform like a dinosaur in comparison to the mobile games of today. Furthermore, the accessibility of mobile games means that Japanese developers are far more likely to turn a better profit than if they developed for the Vita. Confounding the problem even further was the launch of Nintendo’s hybrid console the Switch, which has a lot of the same points that attracted Japanese users to the Vita in the first place; portability and great games. It’s excellent technology that allows it to perform well despite its small form factor, and more and more developers are looking to develop for the Switch, many of whom previously developed for the Vita. Most notably in this list is Marvelous, developers of the Senran Kagura franchise. This, among other reasons, means that sales for the Vita have been consistently dropping while Switch sales have been consistently on the rise - one week in April saw the Switch selling nearly 50,000 units and the Vita merely 5000. So while Sony seems to have completely given up on the Western market, it doesn’t exactly seem like they have much to expect in the Japanese market either - one can only expect the further downturn of Vita sales in Japan as the year goes on, and although it’s doing too well to expect them to announce stopping production of physical Vita game cartridges in Japan any time soon, it may come sooner than you think. That being said, the Vita is now entering into six years since it’s launch, so it’s no surprise that a newer, more advanced console in the Nintendo Switch has quickly overtaken it. Yet the catastrophic failure of the Vita in the West probably doesn’t give Sony much hope for their future portable consoles - meaning that the Vita could very well be their last. If you want to want to buy any physical games for the Vita, then you have until February 15 next year to order them, as Sony will stop stocking them after that. The online store will remain open, however. Although I’ve fallen out of using my Vita in recent years due to the excellence of Japanese mobile games, I definitely enjoyed my time with the flawed console.

Joining them on the single are the ever-talented Kuishinbo Akachan, also known by her illustrator name Kiato, and multi-talented guitarist Azuki who you hear jamming out during the song. We've seen a lot of interaction as of late between these artists, with KOTONOHOUSE frequently utilizing Kuishinbo Akachan's vocals in their latest releases. The tie-in with Yunomi from there is a simple one, especially with Kiato being his main artist and collaborator since their career launched years ago. It's perhaps because of this group familiarity that the whole song comes together so well, creating a perfect blend of each partaking artists core values. Available for free download via SoundCloud now, you're definitely going to want to keep a close eye on these artists throughout 2018 as they continue to grow further and further.

When looking at a game like Taiko no Tatsujin Nintendo Switch Ver., literally translated to Drum Master Nintendo Switch Ver., you'd think the game would include, you know, a drum. Previous home releases of the arcade title certainly did, but up until last night it was looking like you'd be using your joy-cons and the touchscreen, but nothing else. Let's take a look at the trailer below: It took about 2 minutes 4 seconds, but there it was; the eventual announcement of a physical drum attachment for Taiko no Tatsujin Nintendo Switch Ver. in all its glory. Priced at an additional 7,000 yen on top of the base game, it comes in a little expensive but is undeniably an essential for the real gameplay experience. With that being said, however, there definitely were plenty of other things to be excited about in the trailer, including the incredible tracklist filled with recent additions to the arcade version and more. From the Splatoon Theme, all the way to Pop Team Epic, everything from the arcade version is being crammed into one portable package on the Nintendo Switch. On top of this, there's actually a number of ways to play outside of using the drum, which while very cool, it remains pretty obvious that the drum is the real way to play. It won't be as hardcore as the arcade version of the game, as has been standard for most if not all of the Nintendo Taiko no Tatsujin releases, but I'm sure it'll be jam-packed with memorable moments. Set to release on July 19, 2018, and priced at 6,100 yen, I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty more about the game leading up to its release.

13483|2018-05-15|17:00||http://otaquest.com/asahi-clear-cafe-latte/| News | N/A | Asahi's Seriously Gone Too Far With Their Latest CLEARLatté | We tried out Asahi's latest CLEARLatté, the latest addition to the world of clear imitation beverages, and have officially concluded that they've taken it too far this time. |Alright, it’s 2018, we have electric toilet seats, we have people living in space, we have robots calling restaurants and making reservations for us. What we also have, for some reason, are trendy, clear beverages that claim to hold flavors such as blueberry yogurt, milk tea, melon soda, and most recently, café latte. Or, as Asahi is coining it, “CLEAR Latte”. CLEAR Latte hit convenience stores and supermarkets just days ago, and today I finally gave in and decided to purchase a bottle, with my usual blank expectations of these super hip flavored water beverages. In my opinion, making a drink clear holds the same comedic value as making a tiny version of an everyday object. There’s no clear objective, really, it’s just invented for the sake of novelty. Clear drinks contain little sugar or calories, and they usually just taste exactly what they are; flavored water. Some people will swear that they taste just like the real thing, but I’ll be straight --- they don’t in my opinion. It’s as if an alien has been asked to recreate Earth drinks based off an artificially injected memory of the original. Asahi’s CLEAR Latte sits radiantly upon its shelf, its packaging already drawing many questions to mind. Why is it clear? How can something clear taste creamy? Why am I about to buy this? I decided not to judge it too much before trying it. Asahi claims to have extracted whey minerals from milk, discarding the white colored milk fat and protein, in order to make the creamy flavor while maintaining transparency. The coffee flavor comes from espresso extract, which seems like a far less complicated process. I took my first sip of the cold beverage and was greeted by a strangely accurate coffee taste. The creamy aspect is there, too, but overall, it all just tastes sort of... Plastic-y. This is, of course, followed up by a purified-water-taste finish. I daresay it tasted like a diluted cafe latte, or like when all of the ice melts into your iced coffee. I really can’t say that I especially enjoyed it. I went back to try it again a few hours later, but it tasted even less pleasant at room temperature. I’ll just have to add this to the growing list of clear beverages that just aren’t for me... If you dare try CLEAR Latte, feel free to buy one for 124 yen at most convenience stores and supermarkets in Japan. |CLEARLatté, Clear Latte, Asahi, Clear Drinks

Opening in 97 theaters just last Friday, the GKIDS release comes during one of the biggest years for Masaaki Yuasa internationally in recent memory. Originally screened in Japan back in May 2017, the film was met with rave reviews from fans and critics alike. Being one of two animated feature-length films that Masaaki Yuasa directed and released that year, I'm still in total awe of how it was pulled off. While the film is currently only screening in North America and Toronto, Canada, it is expected to open in other major cities across Canada at a later date. For those unfamiliar with the animated film, GKIDS describes it below: From visionary director Masaaki Yuasa comes a joyously hallucinogenic but family friendly story of Lu a young musically gifted mermaid who unexpectedly joins Kai and his friends' band. The talented but adrift Kai bonds with the spirited Lu but their friendship is at odds in a town where it is believed that mermaids bring disaster. An official selection of Sundance 2018, Lu Over the Wall is a toe-tapping, feel-good demonstration of Yuasa’s genre-mixing mastery that will leave you humming long after you leave the theater. With another four days in cinemas across the United States and Canada, you're definitely not going to want to miss this film.

This surpasses the combined global sales of Persona 4 and Persona 4: Golden which attained a total of 2.07 million lifetime sales, as well as the total sales of all releases of Persona 3 across all releases globally, reaching a total of 1.93 million sales. Originally released in Japan on September 15, 2016, and then later released worldwide on April 4, 2017, it'd be an understatement to say that Persona 5 has propelled the franchise to new heights. Without even the assistance of re-releases on new consoles, or even alternative stories such as the upcoming Persona 5: Dancing Star Night, the title has already become the best-selling game in the franchise. By December 1, 2018, the game had already sold 2 million copies worldwide. With all this being said, it comes as little surprise that the game is being received so well around the globe. It came at the perfect time, with the resurgence of interest in JRPGs at its peak. Follow that up with a number of tie-ins and even a currently airing television anime, and you've got the perfect recipe for sales. It'll be interesting to see what the rest of the year brings for Persona 5, especially with the aforementioned Persona 5: Dancing Star Night set to hit PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita during Spring 2018, but only time will tell.

Best known for his gorgeous work on series such as Final Fantasy and Vampire Hunter D, the creator has not only solidified himself as a genius within the world of video games, but the realm of art as a whole too. This year's San Diego Comic-Con will be taking place from July 19-22, with the event being held at the San Diego Convention Center. Holding a firm grasp on the industry since he was 15-years-old, Yoshitaka Amano has made a name for himself in both anime and video games alike. Some of his earliest works involved properties such as the original Speed Racer series back in the 1960s, and even to this day seeing the cover art for games like Final Fantasy VI sends shivers down my spine. The invitation of Yoshitaka Amano also comes at the perfect time, with Dark Horse Comics set to publish the English version of his illustrated biography later this year. In the past, Yoshitaka Amano has also made appearances in the United States at various events such as Crunchyroll Expo in San Francisco.

Tentatively titled Superhot JP, the game brings the action of Superhot to a whole new locale as players are tasked with fighting their way through castles, hot springs, karaoke bars, and even bullet trains. It's not a prequel nor a sequel, but rather, it's set to be an alternative story to the original which is being made with guidance from the original series creators. There's a lot to be excited about here, but there are also a few things that we're hoping change before release; namely, the absence of VR support. Easily one of the coolest titles on VR, it'd be a massive shame if we didn't see Superhot JP make the jump to the platform, especially with it currently being exclusive to both PlayStation 4 and PC, two machines that have VR support. Additionally, the title is set to be released in Japan first, and then "possibly" releasing internationally. The game is described below: The iconic red guy is coming to Japan! With the innovative time-moves-only-when-you-move fps game play, SuperHot JP (not the real title) is a new game set in the SUPERHOT universe. While maintaining the same intoxicating rhythm of slow motion combat, this new SUPERHOT presents a brand new adventure with a distinctive Japanese flavor. Dodge bullets, while bathing in a hot spring. Battle the red guys in a variety of new Japan-inspired environments, from hot springs to samurai castles, from seedy Tokyo alleyways to karaoke bars and bullet trains. Escape the "real world" and into the mysterious reality of the new Budd-OS. One step at a time While there has currently not been a release date announced for the title, we're hoping we don't have to wait too long to get our hands on this one. With the inclusion of new locales and weapons stemming from Japan's history, I'm hoping this will make for a totally worthwhile addition to the Superhot universe. There has currently not been a price point announced for the title, though GameTomo has shared that " It will be standalone but priced very reasonably."

As someone who has been listening to the group almost since their initial formation, I couldn't be more happy to see this song come to life, and it certainly seems like I'm not the only one: Every piece of the music video and single flawlessly represent the family that the group has created amongst themselves, making for a number of feel-good moments layered over an equal amount of emotional ones. I'd be lying if I said it had been an easy past six years for the rock outfit, but I'm definitely happy to see them still rocking out like they used to even today. When compared to their last single which was so focused on the industry politics that almost tore the group apart, this certainly feels like it has a little bit more of an indigo la end touch, another of lead member Enon Kawatani's band projects. The release constitutes the band's 9th studio single, and I can only hope this means that there's an album on the way soon too.

It'd be an understatement to say that I'm freaking out about how good this collection is; though I'm it wouldn't hurt The Pokémon Company to put the designs on a t-shirt. Everything is as vibrant and colorful as it is true to the series -- it's almost impossible to find fault with each and every piece. The collection is set to release May 19 at Pokémon Center locations in Japan, and I'm sure it'll be gone pretty quickly, especially with the arrival of Summer in Japan. One of the most talented illustrators of her kind, F*Kaori flawlessly manages to bring the pop flair of 80s design into each modern piece she works with.

From Kung-Fu pants to Mandarin-style shirt collars, many Japanese clothing manufacturers, especially indie brands, have been releasing an abundance of this casual yet almost lavish type of style for a little over a year now. One notable brand, Ikebukuro’s Yubi Ga Ippon (which roughly translates to “one finger”), has been releasing powerful piece after powerful piece since their start a few years ago. Just looking at their small storefront located inside of Ikebukuro’s own SPINNS makes me feel as if I’m walking the nighttime streets of Kowloon. It makes sense that the brand would make you feel as though you're in somewhere totally different, Yubi Ga Ippon’s brand concept is pretty straight to the point about it: “From the new growing fashion city Ikebukuro to the galaxy! We don’t want to wear the same clothes as everyone else! We don’t care if people laugh behind our backs. Let’s express ourselves and wear our favourite weird clothes!”. Their aesthetic is clean, fresh, and almost intimidating, and wearing their fashion pieces on the street will surely elicit a few stares. Recently announced on Yubi Ga Ippon’s Twitter account was their brand new spring line to welcome the new season. Notable items included in the new line are wide, red pants, an embroidered blouse to match, long suspender skirts, and more. True to Yubi Ga Ippon’s branding, all of the items are decorated with classic Chinese designs. The pieces are a loose, comfortable fit, perfect for the warm sun and the cool breeze that spring beckons. One of my favorite qualities about Yubi Ga Ippon’s fashion line is that all of the clothing from any of their releases can be coordinated together as if they were made to be worn at the same time. Too many times do clothing manufacturers completely change their color schemes between releases, and even change their entire aesthetic to fit whatever popular trend may be present. I think Yubi Ga Ippon puts a lot of hindsight into their pieces, making sure they’re consistent; someone could effectively have an entire wardrobe solely consisting of Yubi Ga Ippon and never run out of coordination options. Those interested in checking them out should note, Yubi Ga Ippon has stores across Japan located in Ikebukuro, Nagoya, Okinawa, Fukuoka, and Osaka. You can check out their new Spring collection of clothing via SPINNS’ official website.

First came the anime in January 2017, which was succeeded by the launch of the mobile game Girls Band Party! just two months later. The game, in particular, enjoyed great success thanks to its innovative character animation and usage of licensed anime songs to bolster it’s initially thin roster. Western fans were also treated to an English localization of the game, which released this April, meaning that it joins the stark few mobile games that make their way overseas, such as Granblue Fantasy and Love Live! School Idol Festival. As a result of this rapid development in merely two years, the series has increased in popularity to the extent that it can now stand tall next to industry giants such as The iDOLM@STER and Love Live!. Yet, Bushiroad does not intend to rest on their laurels and are hoping to develop the series even further with several new announcements. Anime series are always influential in getting newcomers into an idol franchise, not only because anime often function as an excellent gateway into a given series, but also because they serve as an excellent advertisement for the rest of the series, in BanG Dream!’s case, the mobile game. So, the recent announcement of a second and third season of the anime will most likely be a great way to get even more into the franchise. The second season will launch next year in January, followed by the third season in October. By releasing both seasons in the same year, there’s a high possibility that the story will be split over two cours, as many idol series before it has opted to do. In turn, this ensures that the anime will be discussed over the full course of the year, instead of just one season, as fans discuss what might happen in the continuation. The iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls benefitted from this same phenomenon back in 2015 with its own split-cour anime series. Even more exciting, however, was the announcement of a new, all-male project via the launch of an official website last week. The website showcases a new unit named “Argonavis,” which is made of three new male idols whose names and identity are as of yet still unknown. What’s more is that their first live will take place very soon, in July, which presumably means that this project has been kept under wraps for a while now in order to prepare ample material. Although this new male idol project will not inhabit the same fictional universe as the already-existing female idol project, as Bushiroad president Takaaki Kidani confirmed via Twitter, it’d be safe to assume that the development of this all-male project will follow a pattern similar to the previous, all-female project’s development. The unit Poppin’ Party was unveiled first, which in turn became the main unit for the game and anime, meaning that we can expect more all-male units to be announced, but that Argonavis will remain as the main one. The male virtual idol scene is by no means a barren market, but it definitely hasn’t seen as much attention as the female scene. Bang! Dream’s foray into this scene could be a turning point for it, but even if it isn’t, it will help bring a new, predominantly female demographic into the series. So not only will the new anime series help further advertise the game, but the series’ appeal has also been widened significantly. All of this means that there’s never been a better time to be a fan of Bang! Dream, and even if you’re not interested, the series’ rapid development is certainly worthy of recognition.|BanG Dream!, Bang Dream, Bushiroad

With "Napoleon," 2ToneDisco steps away from the traditional structure of idol music, utilizing the vocals of Happy Kuru Kuru as a structural part of their signature sound. It's a departure from the high-paced traditional structure of idol music, instead opting for something a little more slowed down and relaxed. As always, Happy Kuru Kuru absolutely own the track, utilizing their dynamic vocal range to bring a wave of energy to the listener, while 2ToneDisco's production lays the groundwork to keep listeners moving. While the single dropped over the weekend, the releasing label Attack the Music has begun teasing an upcoming music video. Those interested in checking out more of 2ToneDisco's sounds can find them on both SoundCloud and Twitter.

13462|2018-05-11|16:00||http://otaquest.com/shonen-jump-smartphone-manga/| News | N/A | Shonen Jump is Getting Serious About Manga on Your Smartphone | Even though the legendary Weekly Shonen Jump celebrates it’s 50th anniversary this year, it’s clear from recent announcements that the magazine isn’t just content with remembering it’s past, but is laying the groundwork to ensure that it remains on the top in the future. |Even though the legendary Weekly Shonen Jump celebrates it’s 50th anniversary this year, it’s clear from recent announcements that the magazine isn’t just content with remembering it’s past, but is laying the groundwork to ensure that it remains on the top in the digital future. May 5 saw the launch of 'Jump Rookie,' a digital manga service designed to help rookies showcase their work to a broader audience. Budding Mangaka can upload their work to the website, receive feedback, and even have a chance of a serialization in Jump if their series is popular enough. Even those living outside of Japan can take part, although it’s worth noting that manga in languages other than Japanese won’t be accepted. What makes the Rookie service special though, is that all of the manga featured on the website is formatted especially for reading on a smartphone. Many of the series use horizontal panels on continuous vertical pages, much like Korean manhwa. Consumption of digital manga has increased considerably in recent years, so it makes sense that the biggest manga magazine would attempt to take advantage of this and ensure that it stays relevant in the changing landscape of manga. There are already quite a few manga on the website, with regular updates, but the number still isn’t exactly massive. Plus, there isn’t much variation, with most of the series being gag manga. But that’s where the “First Annual Jump Vertical Manga Prize” comes in. Running until July 20, all series uploaded on Rookie during the competition period will be entered into the competition, provided that the uploader doesn’t decide to opt out. The grand prize is a hefty one million yen (~9100 USD) and a guaranteed serialization in ‘Jump+’, Shonen Jump’s online manga store. Similarly, the runner-up prize offers 200,000 yen (~1800 USD) and a serialization as well. Yet, what’s interesting is that it is stated that at least three series will be chosen for serialization, essentially implying that Jump is prepared to give serializations to all of the entries that they like the best, which is an unprecedented chance for any budding mangaka. Usually, competitions of this nature have very strict rules, but the point above and further information makes this one actually very free in comparison. Not all is the genre of the work entirely up to the author and can be aimed at any of the three core demographics of shonen, seinen, and shoujo, but entries can be submitted in either color or monochrome, making it very convenient for digital artists. Furthermore, works that have already been uploaded to other sites such as Pixiv can be entered into the competition - giving artists yet more freedom. The number of pages or panels needed also isn’t specified, but those aiming for a serialization are advised to have up to three chapters ready, as is custom when applying for a manga serialization. Such a generous and open competition seems to signal a strong will from Jump to push forward with its development of digital, smartphone-orientated manga. Certainly, it already dominates the paper magazine world, so why not try its hand at another medium? I hope that we see some great works taking advantage of this excellent opportunity if nothing else.

For those of you unfamiliar with their signature-sounds, if you follow bi-annual Comiket and M3 releases, you might have seen him on both of MEGAREX’s FUGENE compilations. Otherwise, most of his tracks are independently released on his Soundcloud and Bandcamp. Anyways, PSYQUI is a pioneer of the futurecore genre, which combines the cutesy elements and chord progressions of future bass with the hard-hitting, fast-kicking punch of happy hardcore. His tracks are perfectly mixed down, feature tight percussion, and a crisp sound; yet at the same time, there’s always a real powerhouse vibe that will have you headbanging and stomping your feet. Luv U 4ll ver by PSYQUI PSYQUI’s new song, “Luv U 4ll ver”, starts out with a super cute music box melody, with an underlying drum break to hint at the ham to come. PSYQUI never lets us down with his drops, and this track is no exception. The clean half-time hits make this track an absolute slammer, and it gets even more hype with the following happy hardcore section. A pitched up “I wanna love you every day!” echoes in the background, tying the track together and conveying the message of the track. When asked about the theme and inspiration for the track, PSYQUI had this to share: “At first, I wanted to have a kawaii-complextro section to make up the track. So I thought to myself, 'What if kawaii PSYQUI were to collab with kawaii Virtual Riot, what would that sound like?'” The track ended up not containing as many growly, harsh elements as his other songs, however; this quality makes the track sound even more like a fun, dancey love song. When asked if he had any other comments, PSYQUI emotionally shared: “I want a girlfriend :(“ Those interested in checking out more from PSYQUI can find his works on both SoundCloud and Bandcamp.|PSYQUI, MEGAREX, Love You All Over, Luv U 4ll ♡ver

Forget Infinity Wars I say. While we're at it, forget Marvel vs. Capcom too. In fact, let's forget anything having to do with Marvel entirely, and let's not even factor the many 'vs. Capcom' titles into the equation at all. BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle is the most ambitious crossover event in the world, and you can play it right now. From now until the end of the day on May 14, you can play the fighter's demo version with others via netplay on both the PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch. There is a catch however, as the two platforms have different requirements for being able to access the beta. On PS4, you have to have preordered the game either before now or even during the beta period. If you're a Switch user, you have an arguably better deal in that the beta is available to any and all users. After the netplay beta period, you'll be able to access another version of the demon featuring local play only. In the beta, players have access to a limited selection of characters, not including the DLC characters, naturally. From each game series, you'll be able to take control of the following: BlazBlue: Ragna Jin Noel Makoto Rachel Hazama Azrael Iron Tager No 13 Es Persona 4 Arena Yu Yosuke Chie Yukiko Under Night In-Birth Hyde Linne Waldstein Gordeau RWBY Ruby Weiss Arc System Works has also taken to posting the game's fully-animated opening over on their YouTube channel, so you can check it out below. And what's this? RWBY's first official appearance as a 2D animated work? Before publishing this story, I downloaded the beta onto my Switch and gave it a whirl. In both TV mode and handheld mode, I was treated to the same buttery-smooth anime fighter action that I've come to expect from any ArcSys game, and my netplay experience suffered naught in a crowded lobby. The idea of being able to carry this game wherever I go is an immensely enticing one, though I should probably still consider investing in that Switch HORI Hayabusa fightstick... BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle launches in full for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and PC on May 31 in Japan, and on June 5 in the Americas.

13459|2018-05-11|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/masaaki-yuasa-2018-breakthrough/| News | Anime | From 'DEVILMAN Crybaby' to 'Lu Over the Wall', 2018 is the Year of Masaaki Yuasa in the West | While Masaaki Yuasa has always been an incredibly accredited visionary director, it wouldn't be until 2018 that the West truly started to appreciate his prowess. |While it goes without saying that Masaaki Yuasa has always been accredited as a highly-artistic visionary director within the field of animation, it wouldn't be until this year that his genius was truly recognized by the masses in the Western world. When looking at the year-starting monolith that was DEVILMAN crybaby, and even jumping back to the 2017 Lu Over the Wall (Releasing in North America on May 11, 2018), now, perhaps more than ever before, people aren't just talking about his works -- they're talking about Masaaki Yuasa. With the Gkids release of Lu Over the Wall hitting cinemas across North America today, I wanted to take the time to highlight the incredible career of Masaaki Yuasa. Born in 1965 within the Fukuoka Prefecture, three hours north-west of Tokyo, Masaaki Yuasa began his anime career much like any other renowned creator -- working on children's anime such as Chibi Maruko-chan and Crayon Shin-chan at the age of 25. From there, he'd continue working various animation roles, including animation director, until the year 2004 when he truly put himself on the global map. During the year 2004, the world was introduced to Masaaki Yuasa's creative genius through the animated film Mind Game, which would later be recognized as the entry point for Yuasa's signature all-over-the-place animation style. Recognized through a number of awards from around the globe, as well as receiving recognition from the late Satoshi Kon, it seemed like all eyes really should have been on Yuasa. In the following years, we'd proceed to see a number of works made alongside Studio MAPPA, but it wouldn't be until 6 years later that Masaaki Yuasa would truly shine again with the airing of The Tatami Galaxy. Since the 2010 release of The Tatami Galaxy in the proceeding years, it'd be fair to suggest Masaaki Yuasa has been on a constant rise in recognition not just in Japan, but around the entire globe. With the 2014 release of an all-time favorite anime series of mine, Ping Pong, I again was lucky enough to see Yuasa's creative genius truly resonate. Just a year prior in 2013, we saw Yuasa announce the launch of his most ambitious project yet; his own animation studio under the name of Science Saru. Jump forward again and we see the newly formed Science Saru working alongside American cartoon series Adventure Time, blessing the world with the much-loved "Food Chain" episode from Season 6. Things went a little quiet for a minute after this, and it became apparent why pretty quickly. In 2017, Masaaki Yuasa released not just one, but two feature-length animated films. Both "Night is Short, Walk on Girl" and "Lu Over the Wall" were immediately met with domestic praise for their gorgeous animation styles and powerful storytelling techniques. Shortly thereafter, Lu Over the Wall would even be recognized as an official selection of the prestigious Sundance festival, and would also go on to win Grand Prize at the Annecy Animation Festival in France. During the beginning of 2018, just three days before the release of one of Yuasa's most recognized project to date, it was announced that North American film distributor Gkids had acquired both of these films for distribution, as well as 2004's "Mind Game," the very film that put Yuasa on the map in the first place. It would be three days later, on January 5, 2018, that this move would begin to truly mean something to a much wider audience. DEVILMAN crybaby came in seemingly out of nowhere, leaving a new audience scrambling to find out just who Masaaki Yuasa was, as well as launching his name further into animation royalty. Perhaps more than ever before, 2018 truly feels like the year of Masaaki Yuasa internationally; whether it be the recognition earned from DEVILMAN crybaby or the screenings of his animated films such as Lu Over the Wall in North America, I couldn't be more excited. If the past ten years have been anything to go by, there's a whole lot of reasons to look forward to what comes next from the visionary director. While I couldn't necessarily suggest something like DEVILMAN crybaby to the entire audience of Lu Over the Wall, I certainly could suggest the opposite. In theaters across North America beginning today, fans of Masaaki Yuasa are not going to want to miss Lu Over the Wall during its theatrical run. With a solid streak of high-performing Japanese animated films taking over the West, we're sure you'll love the stylings of Science Saru in their latest theatrical work.

One of the main benefits of the official unveiling today, however, was a closer look at specifics of specs and higher quality imagery: While it hasn't been specified whether we'll be seeing any differences between both the Japan and Asia Edition of the console as opposed to the International Edition, it's pretty safe to assume that both will be the same internally outside of the design.

13439|2018-05-09|14:00||http://otaquest.com/zeros-tea-time-detective-conan/| News | Manga | All Hail Amuro in New ‘Detective Conan’ Spinoff ‘Zero’s Teatime’ | Legendary mystery series Detective Conan certainly seems to have returned in good form from its recent prolonged hiatus, especially given the launch of a new side series 'Zero's Teatime'. |Legendary mystery series Detective Conan certainly seems to have returned in good form from its recent prolonged hiatus. Not only has mangaka Gosho Aoyama returned with an excellent new arc to kickstart the series back into life from hiatus, but the recent movie Zero’s Executioner was one of the best in the series. A key reason as to why the movie was so good was because of the heavy inclusion of the “triple-faced” Amuro Toru, who is one of the interesting characters in the series right now. So, when I heard that Aoyama would be launching a spinoff series based on Amuro, I was ecstatic, to say the least. Titled “Zero’s Teatime,” the spinoff follows Amuro’s daily life, and will show readers how he manages to juggle his multiple identities as a waiter at Poirot; as Kogoro Mouri’s apprentice; as a private detective; as an agent for the National Police Agency; and as Black Organization operative Bourbon. The first chapter gives us a taste of that. We see a day in Amuro’s life, beginning with him waking up and getting ready for his shift at Poirot, working with Azusa Enomoto during the day, before changing into his Bourbon persona and setting off to perform his duties as a Black Organisation member at night. The contrast between Amuro’s life in the day and at night is readily apparent. In Poirot he is friendly and somewhat clueless, actually forgetting to eat lunch until Azusa reminds him. But once he begins his work as Bourbon at night, he loses this friendliness as he diligently cleans his handgun, changes into a smart suit, and reaffirms his desire to find and kill Shuichi Akai as revenge for the death of Scotch. Even so, Amuro’s ruthless true self as Bourbon is hinted at it even in the first few panels of the spinoff, as he accurately counts down to when the kettle boils whilst making his morning tea. Although it’s only the first chapter, I’m really excited to see where this spinoff goes. Amuro is one of my favorite characters in the series right now, so I’d welcome any chance to see him in action. The author, Takahiro Arai, also seems keen to accurately and faithfully depict Amuro in his new spinoff, stating that he asked Aoyama countless questions, even inquiring as to whether Amuro would be a cat person or a dog person. That being said, I do worry that if all of the mystery of Amuro is stripped away and the mechanics of his daily life clearly explained, then this could, in turn, undermine the core appeal of Amuro as a mysterious triple-faced character. Furthermore, I hope that this new Amuro-centric spinoff does address some of the recent fears of Conan fans that Amuro’s surge in popularity may push Aoyama to incorporate him more in the main story, which in turn may take away from already established and widely loved characters such as Heiji Hattori and Kaitou Kid. After all, the manga made a big effort when returning from hiatus to advertise that Amuro would be involved in the new mystery, and not just that Edogawa Conan himself would be back in action. But hopefully, by creating a spinoff series, Aoyama will be able to please both sets of Amuro-loving and Amuro-fearing fans equally. In any case, Zero’s Teatime is now serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from May 9 onwards, joining the same magazine as it’s parent series. The magazine also features an exclusive postcard of Amuro as well as a new illustration of the climax of the new movie by Aoyama. Obviously, newcomers will be very confused if they try and pick this series up, but hopefully, longtime fans can find some enjoyment in it. I know I will.

Anderson’s filmography is as varied as it is excellent, from the heartwarming coming of age story Moonrise Kingdom, all the way to the generation-spanning ensemble epic The Grand Budapest Hotel, earning him a legendary status in the pantheon of modern western cinema. Mochizuki is a legendary icon himself, with his works Dragon Head and Zashiki Onna considered as some of the best horror manga ever produced, making him a cult icon next to the already widely-known and appreciated Junji Ito. To have the two come together in any form whatsoever is certainly unprecedented, but also an amazing partnership between two legends in their own right. Anderson was also seemingly puzzled by the idea of having his latest film, Isle of Dogs, turned into a Japanese manga, admitting that he thought it would be “impossible to adapt” at first, but after seeing Mochizuki’s work on the project, he became convinced that it might be possible after all. Mochizuki, on the other hand, was very confident that he could make it work. Once he heard about the film and was approached with the idea of creating a spinoff manga based on it, he considered himself as the “only one” who would be able to do such an adaptation. Certainly, just by looking at the preview images below, I can’t help but feel the same way - Mochizuki’s crude but precise artstyle seems to match the mottled aesthetic of the film perfectly. The adaptation launches in Weekly Shonen Morning on May 24 and will run for three weeks. Mochizuki’s describes it as a side story to the film, stating that he “spins a new story” utilizing the main character and the five dogs he meets on his journey. Incidentally, the film itself launches the very next day on May 25 in Japan - and now I’m honestly not sure what I’m looking forward to more, a new film from one of my favorite directors or the crazy collaboration from a cult icon that intends to promote it.

13437|2018-05-09|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-switch-no-virtual-console/| News | Games | Nintendo Shares That There is no Plans for Virtual Console on Switch | Following yesterday's reveal of Nintendo's new online platform for the Nintendo Switch, it was confirmed that there are no plans to bring Virtual Console to the system. |With the revelation of Nintendo's latest venture yesterday, namely the "Nintendo Switch Online" subscription service, fans and owners of Switch units have been in a frenzy to dissect just what their $19.99 USD a year will be going towards. One of the stand-out features of the service is the inclusion of 20 NES classic titles with built-in online functionality, something that posed the question; what does this mean for the future of Virtual Console on Nintendo Switch? In an e-mail exchange between English-language news outlet Kotaku and Nintendo, a spokesperson for the company had the following to say when questioned about the matter: “There are currently no plans to bring classic games together under the Virtual Console banner as has been done on other Nintendo systems,” There are a few things to take away from the statement -- one being that we won't be seeing the Virtual Console as we know it on the Nintendo Switch anytime soon. That being said, the statement doesn't dispell the idea of other retro games being made available on the console, just that if they do end up there, it won't be under the Virtual Console banner. Originally launched on the Wii and later becoming a mainstay feature of the 3DS and Wii U, Virtual Console enabled players to pick up classic titles across a number of consoles to play on their more modern devices. “There are a variety of ways in which classic games from Nintendo and other publishers are made available on Nintendo Switch, such as through Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Switch Online, Nintendo eShop or as packaged collections,” “Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Switch Online will provide a fun new way to experience classic NES games that will be different from the Virtual Console service, thanks to enhancements such as added online play, voice chat via the Nintendo Switch Online app and the various play modes of Nintendo Switch.” While the inclusion of Virtual Console has long been a topic of discussion for Nintendo's latest hybrid console, with both fans and creators alike hoping to see its inclusion, it'll be some time before we see a suitable replacement it might seem. Rumors regarding the inclusion of Gamecube classics being added to the Virtual Console for Switch can now be dispelled, though I can't say I'm too happy about that. That being said, I'm sure Nintendo has something up their sleeve, and only time will tell with E3 2018 just around the corner. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed.

13431|2018-05-08|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-switch-online-service/| News | Games | Nintendo Switch Online Service Launch Revealed | Announced today, Nintendo's online service for the Switch will set you back $3.99 USD a month and includes 20+ NES classics and cloud data backup. |Nintendo Switch Online, the much-discussed paid online service for Nintendo's flagship device, has finally been detailed. Set to cost just $19.99 USD a year for a single account, or $34.99 per year for families, the Nintendo Switch Online service looks to usher in a number of new features for the hybrid gaming device. Set to launch globally during the month of September 2018, let's take a look at the changes and features of the service below: Starting things off, players will need to note that beginning September games previously available to play online free of charge will require an online subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online service. Yes, that does include your copies of Splatoon 2 and Mario Kart 8, so if partaking in splatfest is a big deal to you, then this is something you'll be needing. With that being said, a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online will offer subscribers access to an expanding library of 20 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles with add-on online features built into the games. The games currently announced for the lineup can be found below: Soccer Tennis Donkey Kong™ Mario Bros.™ Super Mario Bros.™ Balloon Fight™ Ice Climber™ Dr. Mario™ The Legend of Zelda™ Super Mario Bros.™ 3 + More to be revealed If backing up your precious save data online in the cloud is a big deal for you, Nintendo has you covered. While it goes without saying that this should be a basic feature implemented into just about any service, it is nice to know that it is being added here. Additionally, though I'm yet to feel the need to use it myself, it is noted that the Nintendo Switch App for iOS and Android will be receiving expanded features as part of the subscription service. Additionally, Nintendo makes mention of "Special Offers," presumably entailing discounts exclusive to service subscribers in the Nintendo E-Shop. While it may seem quite barebone to start off with, we're curious to see what else Nintendo brings to the table during industry events such as E3 later this year. While the low price point is a welcoming factor for someone who had gotten used to paying $80 for a 12-month subscription to Xbox Live in Australia in the past, the service will definitely need to do a lot of catching up to other services before it's likely to win over the hearts of everyone else. Further information on the service is available via Nintendo's official website.|Nintendo Switch Online, Nintendo, Switch, Online, NES Switch

During April 2018 the town of Saku, Nagano saw the grand opening of a new manga academy, one which is being helmed by legendary creator Buronson who is best attributed for creating Fist of the North Star. Through his new course, "Buronson 100-Hour Manga Academy," a select number of students at Sakudaira Community Center are offered the opportunity to better their skills over the course of a year. The best part? Tuition is completely free. When announcements initially went out about the school, over one-hundred individuals applied, with only 31 students being accepted. Of those 31 students that were accepted, 17 were women, while 14 were men stemming from all across Japan. The students range from teenagers to young adults, all with various levels of experience in the industry. While the course is also still only within its first month of operation, it will definitely be interesting to see the works that come out of it. Quite possibly one of the most recognizable manga series within the history of the medium, Fist of the North Star has been a staple in the industry for quite some time. It's a manga that's stood the test of time, originally published in 1983 via Shonen Jump Magazine, with chatter about Fist of the North Star still continuing to date through various pop cultural references.

There's a lot of hype surrounding them, and there's also a whole lot for them to live up -- after all, this is one of the most impactful anime franchises in the West that we're talking about. Ahead of the release of both installments, Adult Swim has begun streaming a behind the scenes look at the production of FLCL: Opening on a discussion with FLCL Progressive and FLCL Alternative series director Yutaka Uemura, we're eventually thrust into the inner-workings of the studio behind the anime series. Whether it's discussing the legacy of The Pillows' soundtrack for the original anime, or dissecting working as a team on the project, the behind the scenes footage might just be our closest look at the upcoming series we've seen so far.

Well, there's even more reason for celebration in the air, with AKKOGORILLA dropping the accompanying music video for the aforementioned "Yoyu" single, something that I'd been hoping would come to life given how great her major announcement video was. Let's take a look at the music video below: When it comes to the actual single, I've pretty much said it all in my previous write-up. With that being said, the music video in and of itself is an entire aesthetic that needs to be explored. Filmed throughout the streets of Taipei and showcasing a number of landmark locations, AKKOGORILLA is showing as little care as ever as she dances around and alongside the locals. Her fits are as much of a look as ever; oh, and coupled with the single, this music video absolutely slaps. For many here in Japan, AKKOGORILLA may be best known to mainstream audiences as the poster girl of Spotify Japan during their aggressive marketing campaign earlier this year featuring her song "Green Queen." With that being said, it's also becoming more and more common for me to switch on something like Space Shower TV and see AKKOGORILLA hosting whichever segment I tuned into, so I'm sure she'll shed that image soon.

Since then, Kyoto Animation's anime sensation has broken out of Japan and gone international with a massive following around the globe. The synopsis for the first season is as follows: “Nanase Haruka loved to be in the water - loved swimming. In elementary school, Nanase Haruka, Tachibana Makoto, Matsuoka Rin, and Hazuki Nagisa attended the same swimming class together. Time passed, and as Haruka was living an uneventful high school life, he suddenly encountered Rin again. Rin challenged Haruka to a race and showed him how much stronger he had become. Soon enough, Makoto and Nagisa also rejoined the group, and along with a new classmate, Ryugazaki Rei, they established the Iwatobi High School Swimming Club.” For further information about screenings of Episode 0, as well as the premiere of the upcoming series, you can check out Kyoto Animation’s official website.|Free!, Free Anime, Kyoto Animation, KyoAni

That being said, during their announcement we received little more than, well, an announcement. With no images showcased to the audience apart from a mysterious draped device, fans were left curious as to just what SNK was cooking up with this one. Well if recent leaks are to be believed, it looks like we might have our first look at the mini console: Let's get this out of the way, for such a small console, it really feels like SNK intends to pack some serious punch. Gorgeously designed to look like a miniature arcade cabinet, the alleged Neo Geo Mini is suggested to be packing 40+ games that you'll either be able to play on its 3.5-inch screen or your own display through its built-in HDMI output. The full list of leaked titles can be found below: The King of Fighters '95 The King of Fighters '97 The King of Fighters '98 The King of Fighters 2000 The King of Fighters 2002 Art of Fighting Fatal Fury Special Real Bout Fatal Fury Garou: Mark of the Wolves Samurai Shodown II Samurai Shodwon IV Samurai Shodown V Special The Last Blade 2 World Heroes Perfect Kizuna Encounter Metal Slug Metal Slug 2 Metal Slug 3 King of the Monsters 2 Shock Troopers 2nd Squad Sengouku3 Ninja Masters Top Player's Golf Super Sidekicks Blazing Star Puzzled Metal Slug X Metal Slug 4 Metal Slug 5 Magician Lord King of the Monsters Blue's Journey Shock Troopers Robo Army Crossed Swords Mutation Nation 3 Count Bout Last Resort Ghost Pilots Football Frenzy While there's currently no word on just how much the Neo Geo Mini will cost, this most definitely is a game collection filled with value. From Metal Slug to The King of Fighters, there's a number of timeless titles contained within the Neo Geo Mini's small form factor. Additionally, there's still yet to be any word of just when the console is expected to release. While there's still not any official confirmation from SNK pertaining to the leaks, it's definitely worth taking this information with a grain of salt.

There's just one minor problem, every time you see panties, you run the risk of destroying the world as a consequence; because you know, why not. Originally aired during early 2015, Punch Line has garnered somewhat of a cult following, with fans of the series truly finding themselves engrossed in its entirety.

When you live in a town where there are only five students in total attending the school, eliminating the need for even multiple teachers teaching the multiple grade levels of the students. With over two anime seasons under the Non Non Biyori name, I'm sure everyone is well aware of the upcoming anime film Non Non Biyori Vacation which is set to release during the month of August. Well, the official website for the film today revealed a brand-new key image which features all of our favorite countryside kids hanging-out in the luscious forests of the Okinawan islands. You can take a peek at it in all its glory below! The lush locales of Okinawa are such a drastic departure from the rice fields of Asahigaoka that we've become so accustomed to, so as someone who has admittedly not read the entirety of the manga, it's surely going to be a treat to see how the crew has managed to land themselves on Japan's southern-most islands. The film is opening in a rather limited capacity -- just 27 theaters around Japan when it launches on August 25. With these kinds of releases however, it is not uncommon for the theater list to expand depending on the financial success of the first few weeks on the silver screen. Animation studio Silver Link is returning to animate this theatrical release, and the wonderful nano.RIPE are returning to perform the film's opening theme song. The voice actresses of the four lead characters will all be lending their voices to close out the film with the ending song, which will be composed by rising anison craftsman ZAQ. Non Non Biyori is an absolute hallmark of the extremely chilled-out side of the slice-of-life genre, and I've been craving more ever since the credits rolled on that last episode of Non Non Biyori Repeat. If you're looking for something to ease that fast-paced, big city tension away, then I recommend nothing less.

Filled with nods to a number of different genres including hardcore gabber, all while fusing in her signature sound, "Rat Race" most definitely has me filled with a slight appetite for destruction. Opening with the signature blips that defines the genre, we're quickly met with a slew of amen breaks and some seriously distorted kicks. Described as Chippunk by TORIENA, the track consists of almost four minutes of pure mayhem -- a nod towards the evolution of her sound. Back in August 2017, we shared that TORIENA would be making her major debut on Toy's Factory Japan with her "MELANCOZMO" EP that dropped August 21, 2017. Since then, its most definitely been a wild ride for TORIENA, consistently pushing out both new songs and performing multitudes of live shows. It'll be interesting to see what comes next for TORIENA, especially with all the experimentation we've been seeing via her digital singles. If you're interested in checking out more from TORIENA, you can find her on both SoundCloud and Twitter.|Toriena, Chiptune, Chippunk, Rat Race, Toriena Rat Race

Topics covered during the conference with members of press and media included the former member Tatsuya Yamaguchi, as well as the future of the group. Opening the conference was a speech from TOKIO's leader Shigeru Joshima, where he started by repeatedly apologized to the friends and family of the victim, as well as to the general public for the commotion. He revealed that following Tatsuya Yamaguchi's solo press conference, the members of the group held a meeting where Tatsuya Yamaguchi announced that he will quit TOKIO. "I will quit TOKIO. I'm responsible for hurting TOKIO," it was said. Prior to the public press conference, the four remaining members of the group approached the family of the victim, as well as the victim herself, and personally apologized to all of them. TOKIO vocalist Tomoya Nagase had firm words for fans of the group and the media, stating that the public should not blame or try and identify the victim. Group drummer Mashiro Matsuoka spent the conference in tears, announcing that he really doesn't want TOKIO to come to an end. During the conference, an unidentified member of press questioned whether alcohol was truly the one to blame most in this situation, in which drummer Masahiro Matsuoka instantly snapped back stating that it has nothing to do with the alcohol and that Tatsuya Yamaguchi's actions were "sick." While topics like these are always a difficult hurdle, its reassuring to know that not a single member of TOKIO came to the defense of Tatsuya Yamaguchi, with everyone recognizing the extreme gravity of the situation. Since the conference took place, Johnny & Associates have scrubbed any trace of Tatsuya Yamaguchi from their website. What comes for the future of TOKIO remains to be seen, though we can only hope that proper justice is served towards the now former bassist for his horrific actions.

13390|2018-05-02|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/anime-overseas-money/| News | Anime | The Anime Industry has Seen its Profits Grow Overseas Consistently Since 2013 | A new report examining the anime industry's growth trends highlights some interesting trends in growth overseas, most notably in China. |If you haven't heard of the AJA (a fitting acronym for the 'Association of Japanese Animations'), then I can't really fault you. You're very likely aware of the members -- almost all your favorite individual anime studios are a part of the organization. Together, they work on tackling industry problems, and the association publishes a comprehensive report of industry trends every year in cooperation with a set of researchers and journalists. A revised edition of the 2017 report (which details the year 2016) has been released in English, and you can find the whole thing posted right here. In an effort to save you some time though, I'd like to share some of the juiciest bits. In short, the international market for anime is on a steady incline; the world just can't seem to get enough. For the first time ever, the industry as a whole crossed a mind-boggling, record-breaking new market value threshold: 2.0009 trillion yen (~$17.5 billion USD). This is up just about 10% from 2015's 1.83 trillion yen. In fact, this continues a continuing positive growth trend wherein the market has grown by at least 10% year-over-year, which began in 2013. The report has labeled this as "4th Boom" of the anime industry, in terms of sales. It's a boom without consequence however, at least on the home turf where it should count. Due to a mostly level amount of domestic sales (growing only 3.8% since 2013), Japan's industry is not overflowing with profit in a sense. An insane amount of growth has been recorded overseas though, especially in China, South Korea, Taiwan and the US. When a license is sold overeseas, the bulk of the profit goes to the licensing management companies -- that's great for the overall growth of the market, but anime studios and production companies don't really see that cash. Chinese licensing is definitely a topic of interest. Not only have Chinese distributors and streaming companies been buying up licenses by and large, but also have been investing their own cash in Japanese anime production. A government lift on a ban on Japanese theatrical releases also contributed to the growth. However, the report also notes that the Chinese market can suddenly shrink in accordance with the whims of the government, which has been known to establish bans and sanctions against entertainment markets. A final point of interest overall is the breakdown of market areas that have experienced growth and decline. In 2016, the Internet distribution, movie, music, overseas, and live entertainment segments all saw growth, while TV, physical media, merchandising, and pachinko segments all experienced decline. Of course, the unstoppable force that was Makoto Shinkai's your name. contributed to the 41% boost in the movie segment in 2016. Shock and horror with pachinko though -- does this mean that we'll stop being disappointed when our favorite series are set to receive huge announcements, only to find that they were releasing a new pachinko machine? A part of me says "I hope not," since that's part of the excitement of being an anime fan!|Anime Industry, China, anime licensing

13399|2018-05-02|12:00||http://otaquest.com/sf-gallery-famicase-exhibit/| News | Games | SF Gallery Hosts 'My Famicase Exhibition' Featuring Global Creators | Nakano's own SF Gallery is currently hosting the annual 'My Famicase Exhibition' which invites creatives from around the globe to design their dream Famicon cartridge. |Right below Nakano’s new-age, video game inspired fashion store METEOR in the SF Gallery exhibit space exists the currently-running annual "My Famicase Exhibition," that takes place each year during Japan’s Golden Week holidays. Creators exhibiting at the event are tasked with creating their dream Famicom cartridge, complete with a short video game concept inscribed on the back of the piece. As you can probably guess, the artists have really let their imaginations run wild and free, each cartridge imbued with levels of excitement and mystery by respective creators. Famicase initially began in 2005 as an event with a total of 23 participants, all of whom were associated with METEOR in one way or another. Through the years, the number of participants gradually increased, and in 2010, METEOR extended an invitation to over 100 international artists to participate in that year’s event. Now, all designers and artists from all over the world are welcomed to submit their designs, along with an accompanying video game concept, to be printed on the front and back of their choice of color of Famicom cartridge. This year’s exhibit marks 14 years of occurrence and 1,107 total works. This year’s Famicase exhibition is actually the first one I have personally attended and is operating from April 27 until March 13. Being able to grab the cartridges off the wall at will for closer inspection drew out strong feelings of nostalgia as I remembered how they felt in my tiny child hands many years ago. The biggest charm point, in my opinion, was the little paragraph on the back of the cartridge, detailing the type of game that the art would represent. The games aren’t anything more than concepts, unfortunately, but the added wonder of the unattainable leaves a bittersweet feeling. The game ideas ranged from colorful rhythm games to quirky dungeon crawlers, all the way to airy journeys through the questions of human sentience itself. After I looked at just about all 250 cartridges, I noticed that in the center of the room was a table with two Famicom consoles available for attendees to play freely. They also had a commemorative book on sale containing all of the designs displayed in this year’s exhibit, and also a pile of free, huge, full-color posters. I’m sure you’re bound to recognize a few of the artists featured in this year’s Famicase event, and if you’re in Tokyo, be sure check out the free exhibit at METEOR’s underground exhibit hall SF GALLERY until May 13!

The news comes less than a week out from the animated film, which recently had its first 15-minutes streamed online. An early pioneer of the genre, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko acted as the character designer on the original 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam anime series and has played a continuing role in the franchise since. Originally launched in manga format back in 2001 by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, Gundam the Origin acted as a gorgeous prequel to the original Mobile Suit Gundam story over 20 years since it first aired. It wouldn't be until 14 years later that the world would lay witness to Mobile Suit Gundam the Origin in 2015, the anime adaptation of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's works. Just over three years later and we're finally witnessing the conclusion to this story, while also turning the final page on Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's anime career at large. The news might come as a bit of a shock to fans of the creator, especially given his comments back in September that, despite official comment, there "will be more" of the Origin series. At the time Yoshikazu Yasuhiko stated that he was greatly interested in showcasing the One Year War arc of the Mobile Suit Gundam story, though it has since been confirmed that the upcoming Rise of the Red Comet will conclude the anime series. With all this being said, we can only wish Yoshikazu Yasuhiko the best in life as he steps away from anime.

Released digitally in Japan on April 28, the new single showcases a powerful evolution of her signature flow and production value, and I'm totally all for it. Let's take a look at the track below: One of the most interesting things about the major debut of AKKOGORILLA with Sony Music Japan is that this is in fact, not her first time debuting as a signed musician with them. Whether you knew about it or not, Akkogorilla actually used to be a drummer before she turned rapper, at the time being part of musical duo HAPPYBIRTHDAY. Currently streaming alongside the single is a short announcement video, though one could only hope that it makes only a small part of a larger music video. For many here in Japan, AKKOGORILLA may be best known to mainstream audiences as the poster girl of Spotify Japan during their aggressive marketing campaign earlier this year featuring her song "Green Queen." With that being said, it's also becoming more and more common for me to switch on something like Space Shower TV and see AKKOGORILLA hosting whichever segment I tuned into, so I'm sure she'll shed that image soon.

13379|2018-04-30|14:00||http://otaquest.com/noahs-notes-shonen-jump/| News | Manga | Indiana Jones Meets Lovecraft in Shonen Jump Series ‘Noah’s Notes’ | Japan is known for its interesting genre mashups but rarely do they work as good as they do in the recently launched Shonen Jump series Noah’s Notes. |Japan can be known for its oddball genre mashups, but rarely do they work as good as they do in Shonen Jump's latest manga series Noah’s Notes. Beginning serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump several weeks ago, Haruto Ikezawa's latest manga series Noah's Notes follows enigmatic archaeologist Professor Noah Minami Umberbach and unwitting, Gyaru Japanese high school student Mirai Kotobuki. When she discovers a strange-looking rock and uploads a picture of it to social media, her life is turned upside down as she is thrust into a world of peril, mystery and adventure - and she might even learn a thing or two from the Professor along the way. But it’s far from your average globe-trotting adventure story -- instead of resolving mysteries related to the past, the pair actually utilizes archaeology to solve a mystery related to the future, a mystery to the tune of the imminent destruction of humankind. Underneath the earth and in the depths of catacombs lie relics from another era of humanity far before our own, but is almost the same in terms of technology and design. This is because human civilization has actually ‘looped,’ being completely destroyed by an unknown phenomenon 100,000 years ago, before rebuilding itself. In uncovering relics called ‘notes’ from these previous loops, the pair hopes to figure out what causes this cyclical destruction and hopefully stop it from happening again. From this, it’s easy to see the series’ Lovecraftian influence. H. P. Lovecraft’s world was also one where humanity was preceded by an older civilization, mainly that of the Old Ones, and that terrifying things lay beneath our feet and contained within forbidden tomes of knowledge. Whereas Noah’s Notes has yet to introduce anything like Cthulu, it certainly deals with the same kind of concepts, at least in its fictional history. The Indiana Jones influence is equally obvious when you look at the main duo. Although Noah himself is perhaps more rambunctious and destructive than Dr. Henry “Indiana” Jones Jr., the idea of a swashbuckling archaeologist is certainly something that the two series share. You could also compare him to other Indiana Jones alumni such as Nathan Drake and Professor Layton. Nevertheless, as a huge fan of both influences, I was immediately drawn into the story and have yet to be disappointed by it. I’m sure if you share my sensibilities, you’ll enjoy it too, but in case you don’t, let’s dive into what exactly makes the series so great. Firstly, Mirai and Noah’s dynamic is the heart and soul of the series. Mirai is more than just a simple point of reference for the reader into Noah’s world of mystery and archaeology, but his foil as well - her reactions and quips bring out the best in his character, and her disinterest in the past contrasts with Noah’s love for it. Plus, Noah’s teacher-like role to Mirai makes for some tough love, but heartwarming appreciation once he sees his student has understood his lesson as to the value of history. The world in which this series takes place is also immediately engaging, and not just because of the Lovecraftian primordial history that the series explores in its initial chapters. It’s in the second arc, when the duo head to Italy, that the true, international nature of the story becomes apparent. Although I’m sure basing the story solely in Japan could be very interesting, on the other hand not limiting the story to one locale gives it so much more freedom and scope. That scope is, in turn, being constantly expanded as we are introduced to a wider, more varied set of characters, from our antagonists the Knights Templar (as if it wasn’t Indiana Jones enough) to Noah’s academic peers (who are also adventurers, obviously.) What’s more is that the overall plot of the series, finding out how humanity was destroyed in the previous ‘loop’ and how our protagonists can avert it, is an excellent one. In concept, it’s so unique and fascinating that I’m surprised no other series have utilized it before, at least in manga form. Although it might be a bit early to cast judgment, the plot is developing in interesting and unexpected ways, so I have high hopes that we’ll get a satisfactory conclusion - something that’s rare in the world of long-form storytelling and the chaotic environment of serialization. Of course, before we think about the ending, it is important to consider the long-term viability of the series, as there’s nothing worse than having your favorite series being canceled halfway. Thankfully, as it stands the series does always hover around the middle of the Jump chapter rankings, so it’s got a better chance than another Jump series I previewed, Act-age, which has slipped down to the bottom four since the beginning of its serialization. However, even though the author Haruto Ikezawa is experienced, I do have some doubts as to whether he can successfully maintain the series in the long term. He already had two series in Jump with Mononofu and Kurogane, but neither of them ran for very long and were very different in terms of subject matter from Noah’s Notes. Such a career history could either mean that the author is multi-talented and bursting with ideas, obviously a good thing for the future of the series, or that he is simply scrambling for a serialization, trying every genre he can think of to be in with a chance. Although I think the latter is an extreme example, Ikezawa’s history as a mangaka does still put into question the continued development of the series - even if he was an assistant for Eiichiro Oda. In the meantime though, I’m really enjoying Noah’s Notes and I think you might too. It combines it’s Indiana Jones and Lovecraftian elements with surprising excellence to give us a great adventure story underscored by a great main character dynamic and engaging mystery. I may have my gripes, but I’d struggle to not recommend picking up the series. You can read the first three chapters of the series as part of VIZ’s Jump Start initiative, and although it isn’t being translated in VIZ’s English-language Weekly Shonen Jump yet, I’m sure that if the series continues to be as good as it has been, it’ll be picked up in no time. |Shonen Jump, Noah's Notes, Haruto Ikezawa
13378|2018-04-30|13:00||http://otaquest.com/megalo-box-origins-ashita-no-joe/| News | Anime , Manga | Origins of ‘Megalo Box’ Revealed in ‘Ashita no Joe’ Exhibition | Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary project Megalo Box is being well received both in Japan and in the West - but did you know that the project wasn’t originally supposed to be like this? |Currently airing Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary project Megalo Box is being well received both in Japan and in the West -- but did you know that the project wasn’t originally planned as a futuristic reimagining of the legendary boxing series? I recently attended the Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary exhibition which is currently taking place in Tokyo Solamachi, next to the Tokyo Sky Tree, until May 6. The exhibition mainly featured original manuscripts used for the Ashita no Joe manga, as well as animation cels and scripts used in the various Ashita no Joe anime series adaptations. Lining the walls of the exhibit, you'll also find messages from Asao Takamori's fellow mangaka, and even professional boxers, congratulating the series on its incredible fifty years. There was even a little something penned by the eminent Go Nagai for the series. With all that being said, what was perhaps most interesting was the small part of the exhibition dedicated to the new Megalo Box anime series, which as mentioned prior exists to celebrate the Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary. As to be expected from a series exhibit, the script for the first episode along with various reference materials were all there, but most shocking of this all was director Moriyama You’s comments on the origin of the modern series. According to the comments shared, once Moriyama You began planning an Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary anime project, he and his team had many discussions and came up with many ideas; one of those even consisting of a spinoff series based around Rikiishi Toru, Joe’s fated rival and lifelong friend. I'd take a stab in the dark and suggest this would be set before he and Joe met in juvenile prison, but that’s entirely just speculation on my part. They were actually so into that idea that they did several pieces of frankly awesome concept art, which you can see a couple of below: When actually talking about the Megalo Box series itself, Moriyama stated that he wanted to create a character like Joe Yabuki, a character who you could understand and cared about beyond simple empathy. I’ve always wondered what the relationship between the series and Ashita no Joe was since they’re so different in both setting and style, but it seems like the only real tie between the two series is their objective - creating a ‘real’ protagonist, who can better touch the hearts of the audience. Right now only four episodes of the series have been released as of the time of writing, but I’m already in love with it. It follows the story of Junk Dog, as he fights his way up the world of ‘Megalo Boxing,’ a futuristic version of boxing which utilizes exoskeletons. You can check it out on Crunchyroll. |Megalo Box, MEGALOBOX, Ashita no Joe

The flower was discovered by a Chinese research institute in September 2017, but the campaign to get the flower named after Reimu picked up traction on Chinese social media site Weibo around April 19 of this year. When you look at the flower, it’s easy to see why people gravitated towards naming it after Reimu. Not only is Touhou one of the most successful and influential series in Japan, essentially kickstarting the doujin boom that continues strong even to this day, but the flower’s appearance perfectly matches Reimu’s character design. The strong red accompanied by the white on the edge of the petals match with Reimu’s own red and white-accented Miko garb. Check out the flower below: Needless to say, the head researcher was surprised to see the buzz around the flower online and was pushed to name the flower after Reimu because of this popular support. However, a junior researcher was also apparently a fan of the series and therefore pushed heavily for the flower to be named after one of his favorite series. News about the flower has also recently crossed over into Japanese news, with many outlets admitting that it really does look like Reimu “down to a tee.” ZUN, the creator of the series, has yet to comment, but I’m sure he would be delighted to learn that his life’s worok has been recognized in the world of science.

13363|2018-04-26|15:00||http://otaquest.com/one-piece-universal-studios-japan/| News | Anime , Manga | ‘One Piece’ Returns to Take Over USJ This Summer | One Piece has featured as an attraction in Osaka’s Universal Studios Japan for years now, and this summer the series plans to bring back it’s biggest attractions to the park - making it another unmissable summer for fans. |Mega-popular Jump series One Piece has featured as an attraction in Osaka’s Universal Studios Japan for years now, and this summer the series plans to bring back it’s biggest attractions to the park - making it another unmissable summer for fans. First up is the ‘One Piece Premier Show,’ which has occupied the Waterworld stage every year since 2007. Much like Waterworld, it uses both pyrotechnics and water effects but also features musical numbers and minigames in which the audience is encouraged to participate. Since its debut, the show has moved through the series’ story, starting with the encounter with Buggy the Clown, and this year it moves to the Alabasta arc - one of the most popular arcs in the series. Last year, the show had a 99% audience satisfaction rate, so it seems like it’s an unmissable experience for both fans of the series and regular park goers. A newer, albeit smaller attraction returns once more this year in ‘One Piece Water Battle.’ From the title, it’s pretty much self-explanatory, but the attraction is a mini-show in which participants get to battle nefarious pirates with water guns, in order to keep them away from the treasure. I’ve always loved water battles since I was a kid, so combining it with One Piece sounds amazing - although I imagine bringing a poncho is essential. This is the only attraction that won’t require pre-booking and is included with your entrance ticket to USJ, so I imagine everyone will be checking this one out. The much-loved ‘Sanji’s Pirate Restaurant’ is also making its return this year, and this is definitely the attraction I most want to check out. Not only is Sanji my favorite character, but the theming of the attraction looks great - the food is designed for the ladies, mirroring Sanji’s own obsession with beautiful women, and characters from the series also wander around the restaurant and talk to you. After you’ve finished eating, you even get to take a photo with them. Sanji and Luffy are always in attendance, but what other characters will be there changes from year to year. Last year it was Zoro, Bartolomeo, and Duval, so I wonder who will be there this year? Like most of the USJ themed restaurants, it will take place in ‘Lombard’s Landing,’ which is where the Detective Conan restaurant was when I visited in February. As I stressed, only the mini-show ‘Water Battle’ will be included in your entrance ticket, since the rest are big, limited-time events. You can buy tickets on the day, but they sell out fast, so I’d recommend booking online via the website if you can - don’t make the same mistake I did when I went and couldn’t participate in the Conan escape room! Even if you aren’t able to participate in the One Piece events, many areas of the park will be themed after the series to promote the new attractions, so even walking around the park will be a great experience for the fans. Furthermore, the USJ gift shop will no doubt be selling some exclusive merchandise, so you may end up leaving the park with your wallet a little lighter than you expected - I know that I experienced the same thing when I discovered all of the exclusive Conan goods. So if you’re planning on going to USJ this summer and are a fan of the series, then definitely try and check these attractions out. Tickets for the ‘One Piece Premier Show’ are available from 4/24, and the attraction itself will be in operation from 7/6 to 9/30. Meanwhile, tickets for ‘Sanji’s Pirate Restaurant’ will go on sale from 4/27, and the event will last from 6/1 to 9/30.

This is no small deal, and is perhaps one of the best moments to announce something equally incredible -- alongside the tour fans can look forward to Utada's 7th studio album "HATSUKOI" (First Love) when it releases on June 27, 2018. This is going to be big, and Utada Hikaru's label knows this; so for those that pick up a physical copy of her latest album, you'll go in the draw to pre-order concert tickets ahead of the rush. Kicking the tour off on November 6, 2018, Utada Hikaru will be taking over the Yokohama Arena for two-days straight, before heading across the country for a total of 10 concerts with the final stop being December 9, 2018 at the Makuhari Messe Event Hall 9-11, taking place exactly 20 years after her debut album release.

Perhaps most recognized internationally for her incredible work on Kingdom Hearts and Evangelion, there's no denying Utada's incredible legacy. In 2010 just twelve years after her debut, Utada Hikaru would go on a six-year hiatus, with the announcement of her becoming a mother taking place just a year before her comeback.

The sixth entry into the ongoing Origin series of Mobile Suit Gundam films follows the rise of Char Aznable and follows how he became known as the Red Comet amongst both allies and enemies of Zion.

English subtitled version: English dubbed version: I took the time to watch the subbed clip last night, which open up with a recap of the previous Mobile Suit Gundam the Origin V film until around the halfway point in which it transitions into a space battle between both Federation forces and the Zion space cruisers.

An adaptation of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's manga of the same name, I can't recommend both the series of anime and manga to anyone more than I currently do. Every page from the manga jumps out and screams at you, and having fortunately gotten my hands on one of the limited-edition hardcover copies, the color pages truly pop bringing life to every panel.

13350|2018-04-25|15:00||http://otaquest.com/ashita-no-joe-dvd-collection/| News | Anime , Manga | New ‘Ashita no Joe’ DVD Collection is Crazy, But Genius | Legendary boxing series Ashita no Joe is celebrating 50 years since it’s initial serialization in 1968 this year, and we’ve already seen some great events to celebrate that; this only adding to it. |Legendary boxing series Ashita no Joe is celebrating 50 years since it’s initial serialization in 1968 this year, and we’ve already seen some great events to celebrate that - the stylish Megalo Box anime; a new line of merchandise; and a special exhibition that is set to open later this month. Yet, the strangest way the series is being celebrated has to be the Ashita no Joe ‘complete DVD book’ set, which is being sold primarily at bookshops and convenience stores. Every month starting from March 30, a DVD of the Ashita no Joe anime will release. Both the first and second season is being split into nine to ten episodes per disk, making for thirteen DVDs in total, as well as meaning that each disk will have nearly four hours of content on it. These DVDs also only come in at only 700 yen each - making them much better value for money than your average anime DVD or Blu-rays, which will sometimes cost you upwards of 10,000 yen for merely two episodes. A special booklet will also be attached, featuring behind the scenes content for both the original series as well as Megalo Box. Plus, fans who collect all thirteen booklets will receive a special box to collect their thirteen DVDs in. The fact that these DVDs are being sold at convenience stores is rather strange, to say the least. I almost couldn’t believe my eyes once I found one at the back of the magazine section in my local store. But then on second thoughts, I realized it was actually a great move - after all, many fans of Ashita no Joe are older than your average fan, perhaps having seen the anime back in the 1980s or having been influenced by people around them who watched it at the time, such as their parents. Younger, more engaged fans such as myself are much more likely to order DVDs and Blu-rays online, as well as use specialist anime goods shops such as Animate. But, these older, perhaps lapsed anime fans are less likely to do so. So selling Ashita no Joe DVDs at convenience stores, a place where many people go every day regardless of age, means that they can reach a much larger audience. That’s not to say that even those who would usually go out to buy anime DVDs won’t pick up this version of the Ashita no Joe anime, however, as even I’m tempted to do so given its value for money and the exclusive booklet attached. Check out the details of the DVDs compiling Ashita no Joe’s first season below: Vol. 1: Fated Rival - Enter Rikiishi Toru (episodes 1-9, released 3/30) Vol. 2: Explosive!

Twitter user pkjd818 first broke the news in the tweet below: This is interesting. The domain name "https://t.co/N5ohC9irt7" was registered on April 20th. The launch of The Promised Neverland's official Twitter also just happened this week https://t.co/I6xcGoleOj#約ネバ質問箱 pic.twitter.com/o2t7wlgMYj — moetron | pKjd (@pkjd818) 24 April 2018 As highlighted, the domain “neverland-anime.com” was registered on April 20 by ‘Onamae,’ a widely-used Japanese domain registration company. If you visit the website, you won’t find anything just yet, but the WHOIS service that Onamae has put into place prevents anyone else from claiming the domain, clearly showing that it is intended for use later. Whether or not Shueisha themselves filed this registration is another question entirely, but considering that the series’ staff recently created a Twitter at @yakuneba_staff, it seems like the company is moving towards consolidating the series’ online presence for use in the future. So with that being said, it wouldn't be particularly far-fetched to imagine The Promised Neverland getting an anime fairly soon. It’s been running for almost two years now, clocking in at around eighty chapters at the time of writing. Another new Jump series, My Hero Academia, received its first anime series at a similar chapter count back in 2016. Furthermore, the series has proven extremely popular, ranking consistently high in the weekly Jump chapter rankings, often at times higher than more established series such as One Piece and Gintama. Critics have also praised the series, with it recently winning the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award in the shonen category. There’s no concrete information in terms of what studio will be helming the anime project, but there have been whispers of the newly formed Cloverworks - originally an A-1 Pictures branch in Koenji, Tokyo - heading up the project. Personally, I’d love to see Studio Lerche in charge of the project, since they already have experience doing another more unique Jump series in their excellent two seasons of Assassination Classroom. But I’d hate to presume, so be sure to watch this space. In the meantime, you can read The Promised Neverland in English through VIZ’s English language version of Weekly Shonen Jump. The mystery/thriller series follows Emma and her friends as they discover the truth about the orphanage they grew up in, as well as why they aren’t allowed outside of it. |The Promised Neverland, Promised Neverland, Shonen Jump, The Promised Neverland Anime

The news came today via Netflix's monthly "New to Netflix" lineup video, in which the adaptation can be seen on screen from the 1:46 point. Readers from inside the United States of America can watch the teaser video down below: Originally released via Netflix Japan back on January 12, the Mob Psycho 100 live-action adaptation would later be aired on Japanese television later that same month. The show features Power Rangers executive producer Koichi Sakamoto in the directorial role, with series production being handled by Fuminori Kobayashi. While it might be fair to argue that ONE's over series One-Punch Man is the more popular series internationally, within the confines of Japan the number of spinoffs from the Mob Psycho 100 name is unrivaled. From the live-action adaptation all the way to stage plays, Mob Psycho 100 certainly seems to be doing the numbers. With the live-action series just around the corner too, it'll be exciting to see how it tides over internationally. |Mob Psycho 100, Mob Psycho 100 live-action, Mob Psycho 100 live action, Netflix, Netflix Mob Psycho 100, Mob Psycho, one, TV Tokyo

Well, if that was on your list of must-do things while in Tokyo for the Olympics, I've got some bad news -- in a recent announcement, it has been shared that the park is now planning to open up in 2022. That being said, with that information being shared, we've also got some good news to accompany it! Joining the newly estimated opening timeframe of 2022, we've got another peek at the park through the eyes of the studio with their latest concept image. You can find that image below: The concept image is intended to invoke a feeling similar to that of Howls Moving Castle, featuring prominent 19th-century building styling. The theme park will be opening in the Aichi Prefecture and will be based on a 200-hectare piece of land in Expo Park. Already existing at the park is a replica of the house from My Neighbor Tokyo which was utilized in both 2008 and 2015 for Studio Ghibli exhibitions. Having recently made my way to the already-existing Studio Ghibli Museum for the first time myself quite recently, I'm probably more excited than ever to make my way to the Ghibli Park when it opens up in 2022. Like many others, one of the earliest pieces of film I ever consumed from Japan was from the incredible catalog of Ghibli films. It's certainly a shame that the park won't be opening in time for the Tokyo Olympic games anymore, but I'm glad it'll be coming to life nonetheless. We'll keep you updated as more information is revealed. Source: Anime News Network|Studio Ghibli, Ghibli Park, Ghibli Concept Art

Yet, many western fans were surprised to discover that, upon trying to access the game, that it is unplayable overseas. |The mega-successful idol franchise The iDOLM@STER is today celebrating the release of the latest entry into the series, The iDOLM@STER: Shiny Colors, over here in Japan. With that being said, if you're in the West and happen to be a fan of the franchise, you might have been surprised to discover that upon trying to access the game, you're simply unable to play it. The new game follows the idols of 283 Production and their adventures as you, their producer, raise them to become top idols. Different from many of the other recent iDOLM@STER games is that it does not feature a rhythm game element, instead focusing on story events and “idol raising” activities such as training and PR events. It also features an online mode where you can go up against producers and battle each other in “Auditions.” Yet, the number of producers you will be able to face up against has been reduced, following the latest revelation that players cannot access the game from an IP address outside of Japan. I first heard of this on Twitter, and then later confirmed this for myself by using a proxy program, accessing the site with a Korean IP address first, and a Thai one second. The error message you receive also clearly states clear intent on the developer’s part to block overseas IP addresses, as it reads “The Amazon CloudFront distribution is configured to block access from your country.” Previous iDOLM@STER games have only been available on Japanese-region app services, but by using a Japanese account, Western fans have always been able to get around this and enjoy the games. Such a practice seems harmless enough, as fans simply want to play the games and enjoy the series. But this time it seems as though Bandai Namco Entertainment and the developers of The iDOLM@STER: Shiny Colors have taken further measures and outright blocked foreign IP addresses from accessing the game. It baffles me as to why they would do this. After all, the fanbase for Japanese idol series has grown significantly in the past couple of years, mostly thanks to the English-language release of Love Live! School Idol Festival in 2014. Plus, it was only last year that the cast of Cinderella Girls, Love Live! Sunshine and WALKÜRE were greeted by massive crowds when they performed at Anime Expo. So why would the developers bar already existing fans of the series from playing the new game, and in turn heavily deter new fans from getting into the series through the new game? One reason why is that, because the game is currently not available as an app on smartphones and is only available on browsers, the lack of region locking that can be easily done on app stores has to be replicated by banning overseas IP addresses from accessing the server. Bandai Namco might be obligated to do that for legal reasons, but if that was a problem, then why didn’t they ban foreign IP addresses from playing other iDOLM@STER games in the past? Furthermore, once the app version of the game releases for mobile, that may not block foreign IP addresses thanks to the region locking of mobile app stores, but consider that they will be running off of the same server and the same code, that’s probably unlikely. It seems more like Bandai Namco is taking some ill-informed business decisions, drawing the ire of already existing overseas fans and denying potential ones a way into the series. So, if you’re in Japan, you’re in luck and can actually play the game via the official website. Obviously, you could also use a Japanese proxy server if you are overseas. Once I’ve had some time to play the game, I’ll be sharing our thoughts on it soon as well. But in the meantime, I can’t help but proceed through the game with a sour taste in my mouth.|Idolmaster, iDOLM@STER, Shiny Colors

Dubbed as a "Fully remastered collection edition" of the original FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST manga, fans can expect a number of new and exciting additions that'll hopefully make this the go-to copy of the manga for many. Easily one of the most recognizable names within the realm of Japanese pop culture to foreign audiences, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST originally began serialization in 2001 and would go on to be adapted into anime format just two years later. This new limited-edition hardcover release of the manga features a number of newly-colored pages and behind-the-scenes sketches from series creator Hiromu Arakawa. The first release will consist of one-and-a-half volumes from the original series, with each release coming out quarterly until completion. VIZ Media describes the release: In an alchemical ritual gone wrong, Edward Elric lost his arm and his leg, and his brother Alphonse became nothing but a soul in a suit of armor. Their journey to restore their bodies through the power of the Philosopher’s Stone begins here. Fully remastered with an updated translation and completely fresh lettering, the FULLMETAL EDITION is presented with color pages on large-trim archival-quality paper. Set to release in North America on May 8, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST: FULLMETAL EDITION will be priced at $19.99 USD/$26.99 CAD.

While that infectious sound certainly has its roots in Brazil and a history in Tokyo, there's perhaps no name more attributable to its recent club influx than that of Japanese-Brazillian trackmaker Bruno Uesugi. This signature "Du tcha tcha" is one of the key aspects of a genre known as Baile Funk, one which Bruno is dedicated to representing in the Japanese club scene. Following a recent incident that would see Bruno Uesugi in hospital under intensive-care for a number of weeks, they've struck back with their latest "DEEP SPACE" EP which released earlier today. The two-track release comes at an interesting time, representing the positive direction the artist looks to take moving forward. Just a few short weeks ago I shared a post from Bruno, one simply stating that should he make it through these difficult times, all he wants to do is continue making music and DJ'ing so he may see people dance. For those of you who have ever had the opportunity to attend either a Bruno Uesugi solo-set, or even a HAKA GANG set featuring him, you'll absolutely know how well he can work the dance floor. Here's hoping for a speedy recovery from the artist, and we can't wait to see where he goes next. Those interested in checking out the release can find it on both SoundCloud and Bandcamp.|Bruno Uesugi, Burutti, deep space, Baile Funk
13336|2018-04-23|15:00||http://otaquest.com/review-detective-conan-zeros-executioner/| News | Anime | [Review] Fresh Blood and New Frontiers in ‘Detective Conan: Zero’s Executioner’ | Another year, another Detective Conan movie. At least, that’s what I would’ve said a couple of years ago - but these last few theatrical entries in the long-running franchise have been a little bit different, and Zero’s Executioner is no exception. |Another year, another Detective Conan movie. At least, that’s what I would’ve said a couple of years ago - but these last few theatrical entries in the long-running franchise have been a little bit different, and Zero’s Executioner is no exception. The twenty-second film in the franchise finds its footing following a large explosion that destroys the ‘Edge of Ocean’ facility, where the Tokyo Summit was supposed to occur in a week. Edogawa Conan and Ai Haibara catch sight of Toru Amuro in footage of the explosion, forcing Conan to suspect the “triple-faced” private eye’s involvement. However, the hapless Mouri Kogoro’s fingerprints were discovered at the scene of the crime, along with other incriminating evidence, leaving the police with no other choice but to arrest him. Thus starts a race against time to prove Mouri’s innocence, uncover the true culprit, and decipher the true nature of Amuro’s involvement. This review contains heavy spoilers for the movie and the Detective Conan series as a whole. Usually, it'd be fair to say that the Detective Conan movies are very much disconnected from the actual canon of the story. Because of this, many fans don’t actually consider them as canon nor pay much attention to them - that was, until a couple of years ago. The twentieth movie, Detective Conan: Darkest Nightmare, was one of the first movies in the franchise to be heavily related to developments in the manga, revolving around a mystery related to the mysterious Black Organisation and featuring all of the then-revealed members. Detective Conan: Zero’s Executioner follows up on this trend two years later with its own canon-heavy plot, revolving around the conflict between Conan and Amuro - the latter of whom was revealed to be Bourbon, a key player in the Black Organisation, in 2012. It’s because of this that it’s very hard to recommend this film as an entry into the franchise like I would’ve for the last movie, Detective Conan: The Crimson Love Letter. The film’s close connection to the evolving plot of the series would leave anyone not up to date confused at best, and perhaps even angry that they would have later plot developments indirectly spoiled for them. Such a direction is a risky one for studio TMS Entertainment and director Yuzuru Tachikawa to take, as Detective Conan movies have often been used as a way to get new fans into the series, with their focus on spectacle and set-pieces rather than the slow-paced, methodical mystery-solving of the main series. Therefore, it’s clear from this that the film was very much made with the fans in mind - something that I’m grateful for, and not just because I’m a fan. One of many good consequences of making this film for the fans, and less for the casual audience, is that they were able to let Conan and Amuro’s chemistry shine, a duo that has only recently emerged in relation to developments in the plot of the series. Conan has had many great cooperators in the past, such as the much-loved Heiji Hattori, but the relationship he has with Amuro is wholly different from anything we’ve seen before - both of them distrust each other and are constantly second-guessing each other’s motivation and actions. It’s far from a happy marriage, but that’s what precisely makes it so interesting. Furthermore, it was smart to not include any other Black Organisation members other than Amuro, as well as not to reveal the identity of Rum - another high-ranking member rumored to be a member of the police force - as this would take away from Amuro’s aforementioned excellent dynamic with Conan. Frankly, before seeing the movie, I was really surprised at how popular Amuro is over here in Japan, but after seeing him appear in the movie, I finally understood - he’s one of the best elements of the series right now, and is shaking up the twenty-year-old plot in new and exciting ways. Even more exciting is the way that including Amuro in this film has altered the style of mystery storytelling that the series has always relied on in the past. As anyone who has read the manga will know, Amuro is actually a high-ranking member of the Black Organisation as Bourbon - making him one of Conan’s main enemies. Yet, Amuro doesn’t know Conan’s true identity as Shinichi Kudo, nor that Conan knows that he is Bourbon. Because we already know that Amuro is an antagonist, it’s pretty obvious from the beginning that he is behind the events of the film in some shape or form - thus making the film less of a straight-forward mystery then it is a thriller, as Conan tries to uncover Amuro’s true role in the events, all the while trying to avoid drawing attention to himself and revealing his own connection to the Black Organisation as a victim of APTX 4869. Of course, mystery does feature in the film, as Conan still needs to figure out the true culprit behind the explosion at the Edge of Ocean facility as well as who framed Morui, but that’s less of a focus this time around. That’s not to say that previous films haven’t also downplayed the mystery elements of the series, but that was in favor of setpieces and spectacle, most likely in an attempt to draw in new fans. As a result, because the formula of the series had been altered somewhat, I found myself immediately drawn into Detective Conan: Zero’s Executioner and the web of conspiracies surrounding Amuro’s involvement, which surprised me given how forgettable previous movies have been. There’s not many film series that can still engross you in their twenty-second entry, and I feel like I have to give Detective Conan some credit for that. Ultimately as a fan of the series, the twenty-second film of the franchise both entertained me with its tense plot and excellent character dynamics and also excites me as to where the franchise might be going in the future. Toru Amuro is one of the best things to happen to the series in a long time, and even a post-credits reveal that Kaitou Kid will be returning in the next film wasn’t enough to get me off the Amuro hype train. It’s definitely one for the fans, but then again, there are almost twenty other Conan films perfect as an entry point - so what’s the harm?|Detective Conan, Case Closed, Zero's Executioner, Detective Conan: Zero's Executioner

During a recent appearance by both Atsushi Inaba and Hideki Kamiya at Reboot Develop 2018 in Croatia, the two proxied the following message through their translator: “We’re going to knock the audience participation up a bit. They’re still trying to negotiate with Nintendo whether a possible Wonderful 101 Switch release could happen but it always helps when the people in the audience at Reboot clap if they’d actually buy a Switch version of Wonderful 101. So anybody who would buy that, please clap...” It should be obvious that following those words, everyone in the room proceeded to clap. While the two couldn't formally share any information regarding a Nintendo Switch release of their action-adventure title Wonderful 101, it definitely is a massive sign that they're interested in pushing for it, especially in getting the crowd to join like that. Of course, it'll be a little bit of time before we do end up hearing anything more about the matter, so we'll have to keep our eyes peeled for that.

Previously available in English only in the United States and Canada, the move is yet another win for the developing Japanese pop culture scene in Australia. Having been downloaded more than 30 million times around the globe, and frequently topping both the iOS and Android app charts, you've undoubtedly heard the name Fate/Grand Order thrown around more than once. For those not in the know, Fate/Grand Order creative producer Yosuke Shiokawa from DELiGHTWORKS Inc. had the following to say about the game: "Fate/Grand Order is a tactical, turn based RPG which features several chapters that take the players to a different notable point in human history. Together with different seasonal events, players will be put to the test with challenging missions and quests," "One of the greatest appeals of Fate/Grand Order is that it is easy to learn, but hard to master. The game requires both in-depth strategy and skill to advance the player through ever changing obstacles." Easily one of the most successful mobile role-playing games in Japan, Fate/Grand Order leans on the success and rich story of the original TYPE-MOON visual novel Fate/Stay Night to feed its ever-evolving story. Though I myself was never able to get super into the game, mostly due to a painfully short attention span, it's impossible to deny just how much my peers rave about the game. Just one word of advice, try not to overdo the in-game gacha system, okay?

I've spent a bit of time now analyzing the charm of Game Club Project, and there are already a few things to take away from it differentiating them from the rest of the market. For one, unlike most channels, the Game Club Project actually consists of multiple members, with four members currently making up the club.

With a heavy focus on Nintendo titles, you'll find Pokémon, Splatoon 2, Smash Bros. Wii U, and even Shadowverse. This is, of course, in contrast to the usual battle royale-style game choices of Virtual YouTubers that have become so popular in the past. Most videos on the channel already hover around the 100,000 view mark, with some going as high as 450,000 views. Again, not bad for a channel that started uploading just a month ago. It's pretty easy to see why the channel is booming in popularity, and we definitely hope to see more creativity like this in the field.

You can find the newly reworked line-up below: 10:30pm – Dragon Ball Super 11:00pm – Dragon Ball Z Kai 11:30pm – My Hero Academia 12:00am – FLCL 12:30am – JoJo 1:00am – Hunter X Hunter 1:30am – Black Clover 2:00am – Naruto: Shippuden 2:30am – Space Dandy 3:00am – Cowboy Bebop 3:30am – Ghost in the Shell 2nd GIG Easily one of the biggest anime series in both Japan and the West right now, My Hero Academia has remained a fan-favorite since its original series aired in 2016. It's easy to see why Toonami would be wanting this in their programming, and it being even more accessible to yet another wave of to-be anime fans is extremely exciting. Not familiar with the My Hero Academia legacy? Well, why not start off with the series synopsis below: The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual. Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor! Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero. Set to begin airing May 5 on Toonami, you're not going to want to miss this one, especially if you're yet to check the series out.

13315|2018-04-19|17:00||http://otaquest.com/idolmaster-bar-osaka/| News | Anime , Music , Games | Enjoy a Drink or Two at New iDOLM@STER-Themed Bar | If there are two things I love more than anything in this world, then it’s idols and alcohol. This new iDOLM@STER-themed bar might allow me the perfect opportunity to combine the two. |If there are two things I love more than anything in this world, it's absolutely idols and alcohol. Now there's a new iDOLM@STER-themed bar that might allow me the perfect opportunity to combine the two. Located in Osaka, Chuo Ward, ‘B@r 768Production’ (or ‘768Pro’ for short) recently celebrated its grand opening on April 16. Otaku bars are no new phenomenon in Japan, with an Ashita no Joe bar in Shinjuku; a kaiju and tokusatsu bar in Kawasaki; and a Gundam bar in Nagoya, to name but a few. Even with that being said, 768Pro is the first exclusively-iDOLM@STER themed bar in the country - no doubt iM@S merchandise features in other otaku bars, but you won’t find anything but iM@S in 768Pro. That sounds pretty damn good to me. 遂にオープン2日前となりました。 レイアウトもほぼ完成を迎え、後は最後の詰めを行うのみです！！ 皆さんのお越しを社長、事務員一同お待ちしております！！！ pic.twitter.com/0HUnJR3MGs — B@r 768Production（ナンバプロダクション） (@768pro) 12 April 2018 That should become obvious once you take a look at the shop. Covering the walls you'll find tapestries, towels and posters have been hung; countless figures adorn the shelves, and even the surface of the bar is covered with idols looking up at you as you have a drink. If that wasn’t enough for you, then even the glass you get your drink in will be iM@S-themed - they have an entire shelf full of them, and I didn’t even know such merchandise existed before this. Speaking of drinks, to accompany a normal drinks menu, the bar also offers special idol-themed cocktails on a time-limited basis. Depending on the character or unit, the cocktail will have a wholly unique theme and flavor. Three cocktails have been revealed so far, with the first themed around Koume Shirasaka, with eyeballs suspended in a red cocktail to match her horror aesthetic. The second was a purple cocktail themed after the unit ‘individuals’ to celebrate the release of their debut single, ‘∀NSWER,’ on CD earlier this month. The latest was a refreshing, green beverage themed after Kaede Takagaki, queen of puns and alcohol herself. The bar also serves some food to go with those fantastic-sounding drinks, although it’s simple dishes. プレオープン終了です！本日来社頂いたPの皆さまらありがとうございます！また来社される際は社長、事務員一同お待ちしております。来社頂いたPの皆さんはハッシュタグを作りましたので、ご自由にお使い下さい。#768プロ 試飲会の時に作られたカクテルの採用されなかった子たちです。 pic.twitter.com/45l2JQUnOs — B@r 768Production（ナンバプロダクション） (@768pro) 14 April 2018 With the widening of the iDOLM@STER franchise in recent years, it’s clear now that the franchise has many more fans from increasingly different backgrounds. SideM in particular, the franchise’s all-male series, has brought in many female fans, to accompany the injection of new fans when the Cinderella Girls anime aired a few years ago. But fans of all series can gather here, as the bar is making a special effort to celebrate characters from all of the series equally, including SideM content alongside Cinderella Girls, Million Live! and the original 765 Production. Furthermore, the three principal staff members all come from different sides of the franchise, meaning that no matter what particular series you’re into, you’re bound to find a kindred spirit. I, for one, cannot wait to go check out this new bar, and I’m sure that it’ll be a huge success going forward given that it’s the only iM@S-themed bar in the country. I also hope that its success starts a trend of other iM@S-themed bars opening, preferably in Tokyo so I don’t have to travel. But, I’ll take what I can get. You can check out the bar’s official Twitter here, which is the main source of news as well as contact with the bar. On weekdays and Sunday, they are open from 6 pm until 12 am, with the exception of Wednesday when they are closed. On Friday and Saturday, they are open a little later, until 2 am, starting from the same opening time of 6 pm. They are also available for reservations via telephone or Twitter direct messages.|iDOLM@STER, Idolmaster, Idolm@ster bar, Idolmaster bar, 768 Pro, 768 Pro Bar
13314|2018-04-19|16:00||http://otaquest.com/jyonetsu-dream-idol-group/| News | Music | Meet the Middle Aged Idols Challenging Age, Image, and the Industry Itself | “Age has nothing to do with it!” When I first heard the idol group Jyonetsu Dream’s tagline, I was immediately taken aback by the profound gravity of their message. |“Age has nothing to do with it!” When I first heard the idol group Jyonetsu Dream’s tagline, I was immediately taken aback by the profound gravity of their message. The Japanese idol scene is a vicious landscape. It's often characterized by harsh training, strict beauty standards, and toiling for a while before you’re even able to make your debut. Many idols are also discouraged from having romantic relationships by their agencies, or don’t even have the time to do so - Momoka Ariyasu from ultra-popular idol group Momoiro Clover Z famously retired this year, saying that she wanted more time to live a “normal life.” Although conditions have certainly improved in recent years, and as a whole pale in comparison to the harsh conditions of neighboring Korea’s idol industry. With that being said, it’s still a difficult road for any aspiring idol to choose to take. All the more reason, then, that many up-and-coming idols have to be enthusiastic, fit, and young. Young men and women are much more likely to be able to keep up with harsh training regimens, maintain their enthusiasm, and spend a significant amount of time working to break into the mainstream. It’s also not uncommon for idols to be retired once they reach their thirties, or even late twenties because of this - the perceived wisdom is that only young people can make it in the idol industry. But the emerging idol group Jyonetsu Dream is different. Comprised of women ‘around 40’ years old, many of whom are mothers, the group is refusing to adhere to the idol industry’s strict standards surrounding age. They are singing and dancing together, and they’re pretty good at it. I happened upon the group by accident, having been invited by a friend to attend a variety show in Kawasaki which they were performing in. The acts before hadn’t exactly set a good precedent. The show was essentially showing off the talents of a particular dance studio, and a lot of kids are involved in that sort of thing - you can imagine the kind of acts I had to sit through. But, then again, I hadn’t exactly gone there to see an amazing show; I was more there to support my friend, and I had nothing better else to do anyway. So when Jyonetsu Dream appeared on stage as the penultimate act, I was really surprised. My friend had hinted earlier that there was an “mom idol group,” but there were plenty of acts before that featured groups of middle-aged women, so I thought that I had already seen that. Compared to the idols I usually see, they certainly looked older, but they were still beautiful in their own way. Furthermore, the way they moved was certainly not like any middle-aged women I’ve ever seen - their rhythm and energy rivaled that of the younger idols I am a fan of. Before I knew it, I was absolutely enthralled by their performance. Not only were their songs original, but also really catchy - I particularly found myself tapping my foot to “The Loving Doll (恋するキャストドール～球体関節人形～),” and immediately regretted not bringing my penlights. They followed that song with a heartfelt ballad, in the form of “The Same Old Evening (いつもと同じ夜),” which showed a more low-key side to the group, only making me appreciate their talents even more. By the time they finished the show with their theme song, “Jyonetsu Dream,” I was completely won over to the group. However, it wasn’t just the songs that I liked. As I said, the Japanese idol industry is incredibly strict, forcing harsh standards of beauty and youth on any aspiring idols. Agencies often simply don’t believe that older idols can shine as well as younger ones, but Jyonetsu Dream proves them very wrong. These older women are shining as brightly as many of the other idol groups out there, putting on great shows to entertain their fans. And, as their theme song proudly says, age has nothing to do with it. Later, as I looked up information about the group, I also discovered that they are trying to spread this message to other aspiring idols put off by the perception surrounding age in the modern idol landscape. Anyone can join the project, called AIP, by applying on the website. Beyond Jyonetsu Dream, the project has three other groups - “Nijiiro Dream,” “Tokimeki Dream” and “Future Dream.” Together, the four groups perform in live venues around the country, entertaining audiences and fulfilling their dreams at the same time. And who are we to deny these hopeful idols a chance, just because they are older than many of their peers? If they can entertain, if they can shine, if they can make you tap your feet and crack a smile, then I think it’s a project worth supporting. I may be a huge fan of the iDOLM@STER, but the example that the group is setting is one that might change the idol industry forever, for the better.

In promotion of the upcoming Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin anime film, Shinjuku department store Isetan is holding a "WELCOME TO ZEON" exhibition in their stores, and this is where things get really crazy. Calling on the talents of The Queen of England's own appointed tailors, Dege & Skinner, we've now got not just one, but three of the highest quality Char Aznable costumes you'll likely ever see. Using the same fabrics for both the jacket and trousers that can be found on the British guard uniforms, this is a very, very high-quality piece. Similarly so, it has the price tag and exclusivity to match it -- coming in at a little over $8,000 USD, with only three in existence. Talk about something else, right? Set to be on display during Golden Week here in Japan, you'll find these pieces on display at Shinjuku Isetan from April 25. Also set to be made available at the event is a number of other goods, including high-fashion dress shoes, briefcases, and even a 1/144 HG Zaku II Gunpla kit to put inside said briefcase if you will.

Set to hit the PlayStation Store on May 31 with full PlayStation VR support, the cat collecting title will set you back 1,944 yen on the Japanese store. Released October 20, 2014, the original smartphone application made waves globally with its simple playstyle akin to a number of portable titles that built the foundation of many childhoods. Four years later it eyes a comeback with the help of virtual reality, but it begs to ask the question, will it succeed? Let's take a look at the new screenshots below: Akin to the original smartphone title, Neko Atsume VR tasks players with simply laying out food for cats, and then waiting for them to come to you.

Easily one of my most anticipated English-language releases in quite some time, there's definitely plenty of reason to be excited. Haven't heard of the series before this? Well, that'll definitely need to change. You can find the preview provided by VIZ Media below, but beware, it's a doozy: What happens when a mass tragedy hits, but nothing really seems to change? On 8/31 the aliens invaded Tokyo. There was no warning. Alien saucers crashed in multiple areas, causing massive destruction, and the ensuing public panic just added to the damage. Over five thousand people died, and many more went missing. On 9/1, the A-ray bombs dropped. It felt like the world was ending. And it was... boring? Now three years have passed. The Invaders have become a trending hashtag on social media and the people of Tokyo have gotten used to living with the mother ship always overhead. It floats around the city like some sort of extraterrestrial moving castle, blocking out the sun but not much else. You can get a daily prediction of where it will be with your morning weather report. Even the occasional sortie by the small vessels have become blasé, now that the anti-Invader weapon Hujin Type 6 is up and working. Plus, the sudden surge in weapons development and manufacturing has resurrected the failing Japanese economy. The Invaders have become just another part of city life. For Kadode and her friends, life remains gratingly predictable, even though they were all touched by 8/31. And despite living in ground zero of an alien apocalypse, the only true threat they seem to face is getting into college. But while Dead Dead Demon’s Dededede Destruction is an exploration of all the ways in which life doesn’t change in the face of a slow-burn disaster like the invasion, it also presents the ways a seemingly mundane and boring catastrophe can creep into daily life and upend things when you least expect it. And as an added bonus, each volume starts and ends with a chapter of Isobeyan, a spoof of the classic gag manga Doraemon. Isobeyan is a Mushroomian from the future who has an endless supply of interesting gadgets that he deploys to help Debeko, his slacker human friend, find happiness. Isobeyan is Kadode’s favorite manga, and it gives her hope as she faces the dual existential crises of aliens and adulthood. It'd be an understatement to say that within the young adult manga world here in Japan, Inio Asano is one of the greats. His works have a surreal way of pulling you into this alternative reality, telling a story that seems painfully real despite everything going on in his pages. If you're yet to check out any of his other works, and simply can't wait for the second volume of Dead Dead Demon's Dededede Destruction to release, I'd have to recommend Oyasumi Punpun which VIZ Media has also released internationally. The second volume of Dead Dead Demon's Dededede Destruction is set to release July 17, 2018.

13295|2018-04-18|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/laid-back-camp-amusement-park/| News | Anime | One of Japan's Best Amusement Parks is Collabing with 'Laid-Back Camp' | It just so happens to be located very close to Mt. Fuji as well! |When the topic of amusement parks in Japan is brought up, two parks tend to be near the top of everyone's minds - Tokyo Disneyland and Universal Studios Japan in Osaka. This is no doubt because of their ties to two massive entertainment empires, and tend to receive most of the marketing bucks. That being said, if you are looking for some other amazing parks with plenty of thrill rides and unusual attractions, then you simply cannot go wrong with the likes of Fuji-Q Highland in Yamanashi Prefecture a bit outside of Tokyo and Nagashima Spa Land, a short distance from Nagoya. As the name implies, Fuji-Q Highland is located right at the foot of Japan's most famous mountain -- having that beauty ever-present in the corner of your eye while at the park certainly enhances the overall experience. And so, what better place to hist a collaboration event for one of the last season's hottest shows, which also featured locales near the mountain? That's right, from the 28th of this month until May 27, you'll be able to relax like the girls at Fuji-Q Highland. According to the official news release, the main events taking place at the park include a stamp rally, tasking participants with locating the five members of the camping club in order to fill out their cards, purportedly for a reward. Additionally, the Ferris wheel at the park will be decorated in all manner of Laid-Back Camp art wrappings. If you decide to purchase the more expensive free pass ticket, which gives you access to all the rides in the park without having to pay their individual riding fees, you'll receive an original clear file folder. Finally, you can expect the usual haul of original collaboration goods and snacks, including the show's toasted marshmallows. On the first day of the collaboration, a special anime staff event will be held, featuring the voice actresses for characters Nadeshiko and Chiaki, Yumiri Hanamori and Sayuri Hara respectively. Opening and ending theme song singers Asaka and Eri Sasaki will also be present, so hardcore fans are bound to be in for a laid-back treat. Best of all, the event is free to access unless you want a closer seat, in which case you'll need to purchase one through Pass Market. As if the official park collaboration wasn't enough, many other establishments around Mt. Fuji are holding their own collabs. The Fuji Express Line will see trains decked out in art wrappings as well, and nearby Kawaguchiko station will be selling day-pass style bus tickets that include maps of locales from the show. The Saiko Kohan campgrounds (English information link here) will offer a collaboration camping package that is aimed at first-time campers and includes the ingredients for some of the dishes seen in the anime, like gyoza nabe. And finally, those who purchase tickets for the Narusawa Ice Caverns or a roundtrip bus ticket going to the western base of Mt. Fuji will be able to choose from their favorite original collaboration postcards. Phew... looks like you could spend days in the area and just barely be able to grab all of that laid-back, comfy goodness. I can't think of a collaboration event much more majestic than this -- Mt. Fuji is truly a wondrous sight to behold, and I'm glad that a simple show about cute girls going camping has sparked so many to get out there themselves.

The attraction, which is based on Finnish illustrator Tove Jansson's 1945 comic strip "The Moomins," has remained long-awaited by Japanese fans of the hippo-like characters since the parks initial announcement in 2013. While you probably shouldn't be expecting jet-coasters and giant drops at this delicate little park, entrants should look forward to the real-life replicas of the structures featured prominently in the books, as well as a number of other relaxing attractions. Additionally, it's been announced that there will be a part of the park known as Metsä Village which will offer a “Scandinavian lifestyle experience” to visitors, which is set to open earlier than the rest of the park in November 2018. Though it may not be the monolith that both Disney and Ghibli are in Japan, the simple stylings of "The Moomins" has long remained a staple here since the comics initial introduction. Stopping by Sunshine City in Ikebukuro, you might find yourself quenching your first with a Moomin-themed bubble tea, or simply stopping by to snap a picture with the iconic characters out front. Maybe you'll even find yourself stopping by one of their cafés or even their flagship stores for any number of merchandise. With less than a year remaining until the park's grand opening, it won't be much longer until fans of the series can enjoy the world of "The Moomins," even if just for a short time.

13291|2018-04-17|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/bonobo-anti-dancing-laws/| News | Music | Harajuku Bar 'Bonobo' Faces Charges Following Illegal Dancing After Midnight | Harajuku-located bar Bonobo is facing legal repercussions following police discovering a foreigner dancing in the bar after midnight. |For every time I post an article praising the Japanese music scene, I'm constantly reminded that there is a never-ending tirade of blowbacks against the culture behind it being directed by those in power. Back in 2016, the world watched with awe as headlines flew left and right claiming that Japan had lifted its infamous fueihō "no dancing" law that had been in place since 1948. The only problem with those statements was that, while the laws had certainly loosened, the new laws put in place were far from perfect, again leaving the music scene scattered. In the back streets of Harajuku, this problem is being felt more than ever at DJ lounge and bar Bonobo, a self-proclaimed space for freedom and relaxation through music. On March 23, 2018, two years after the revisions of the fueihō law went into place, Bonobo was thrust into the spotlight following three police officers in suits entering the bar of around 15 people and questioning a foreigner dancing after midnight. Upon entering the bar, officers approached the foreigner and proceeded to say "Are you dancing?" to which he replied, "I'm simply shaking my body because I'm happy." Officers then proceeded to pursue with "No, you're definitely dancing. You do know that's a violation of the law, right?" Originally opened by 54-year-old Koichi Seike in 2003 following his living in New York for 10 years, it became apparent to Mr. Seike that he had to bring a slice of New York's diverse and exciting music scene back with him to Tokyo. Operated out of a refurbished 58-year-old house lush with tatami rooms and other commonplaces of the era, the bar would eventually go on to attract the likes of international headline-catching creatives such as David Guetta, Agnès B., and Jane Birkin. As of the revised 2016 fueihō laws that were put into place, it's required that any venue that offers drinks after midnight is required to obtain a specific permit, less they wish to face a fine of up to 2 million yen or two years imprisonment. While the argument may stand that the venue should have held the permit, it's worth noting that it's extremely uncommon for an establishment to receive the permit unless they operate within a select part of the downtown areas. As such, unless Bonobo were to move their establishment entirely, this would simply not be possible. While the fueihō law has existed for some 70 years now, it wasn't until 2010 that law enforcement actively started to crack down on it, realizing that the "no dancing" aspect of it could be used to shut down rowdy parties if people complained. Since then, the club scene across Japan has been losing motion, and it wasn't until 2016 that it gradually started to pick the pace back up again, despite instances like this still taking place. In mid-2017 an article was published in The Japan Times detailing the year gone-by since the revised laws went into place. I reached out to the author of that piece, Patrick St. Michel, for his opinion on the issue: "What's happening at Bonobo is a reminder that, even though the fueihō laws have been rolled back, that there is still very much a force present that can get a venue in trouble if they should choose to enforce. We're a long way away from what happened in 2011 and 2012, when music venues in cities like Osaka and Hiroshima were shut down en masses and serious damage was done to those music communities. But it shows the same threat of closure still hovers over other venues today." "It used to be thought that small spots, such as Bonobo, were safe from the laws, because they're so small and Tokyo is so big. Only mid-size spaces truly faced scrutiny. But this, and other recent activity, show that's not the case. Small spots might be more vulnerable in 2018 than ever before." In the following days after the ordeal, Koichi Seike was invited to the Harajuku police station where he was questioned regarding the events on that night. When discussing with the police, he shared that the customer was voluntarily "shaking their body" and that he was confused as to the ordeal. To this, the police had the following to say "It's a combination of the red and green lighting in your establishment, as well as the music being played, that is actively making your patrons dance." In the end, Koichi Seike would sign the documents containing the law enforcement's requests out of fear of being detained should he question their authority. While it remains to be seen just what will come of this interaction, it's extremely upsetting to see that such ridiculous rules are being enforced. Although I have nothing but love for a number of Tokyo's larger clubs, it's also essential that the smaller bars and lounges can continue to operate, offering smaller DJs and artists a chance to grow and develop. Japan is home to some of the greatest musical talents in the world, and it's more than a shame to see them suffocated by those in power for simply dancing, something many of us take for granted. Let's hope this can change sometime soon for the better. Source: Buzzfeed Japan Images: visivo|bonobo, harajuku, Bar, Illegal Dancing, Anti-dancing law
13290|2018-04-17|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/cautious-optimism-mega-drive-mini/| News | Games | Why You Should Be Cautiously Optimistic About the Mega Drive Mini | The recently announced Mega Drive Mini sounds incredible given the waves Nintendo has been making with their miniature consoles, but there's reason for you to be cautious. |Over this past weekend, there's been a lot of chatter regarding the announcement of the Mega Drive Mini (Working Title) from SEGA, the Japanese gaming company's entry point into the "micro-gaming" market that Nintendo kickstarted with the NES Classic Edition back in 2016. It sounds all well and good; more legal ways to support classic titles is always a plus, right? Well, there's just one issue that's come to light regarding the Mega Drive Mini, and that's the company who are bringing it to life. You may remember the much-despised SEGA Genesis Throwback console that was globally released by a Chinese manufacturer known as AT Games back in 2017. On paper it sounded like an incredible concept; a legitimate throwback to the incredible 16-bit era offered by the Genesis/Megadrive offered almost 30 years prior. There was just one itsy, bitsy problem -- it was a poorly slapped together piece of hardware that did more harm than it did well to the legacy of the Genesis. Let's just go over a few of the most common issues with the console: ​ Choppy emulation of games (The console does not use original Genesis hardware) Frustratingly bad menu designs and navigation issues Wireless controller issues, a whole lot of 'em Poorly constructed hardware Weak game lists (Largely filled with "junker" titles and no third-party games) You see, it's the very same company who put together that SEGA Genesis Throwback console that SEGA has called on to create the Mega Drive Mini, and while we don't know the specifics of their reach in the project, that certainly calls for alarm. In the advent of Nintendo pushing out some legitimately incredible pieces of hardware that are offering faithful and entertaining glimpses into the console's history, there's definitely no room for more slip-ups on SEGA's end, especially now that the world is watching with anticipation. With SEGA additionally having announced that the 'Sega Ages' collection which is set to come to Nintendo Switch beginning this Summer, it becomes even harder to justify the purchase of yet another home console, especially if it ends up being something subpar. Boasting 15 of the companies greatest titles across generations, I feel infinitely more inclined to direct my excitement towards something like this, which is being handled by a company with an incredible reputation in the video game porting realm. There's currently little information released about the console, but we'll definitely be holding it under the magnifying glass until it releases later this year. Here's hoping that SEGA can take charge on this one and make sure it becomes something truly deserving of the Mega Drive name, because believe us, it needs it.|Mega Drive Mini, Sega, Mega Drive, AT Games
13289|2018-04-17|13:00||http://otaquest.com/anime-favorite-last-words/| News | Anime , Manga | Last Will and Testament: Japanese Fans Rank Their Favorite Last Words | One of our favorite characters dying is often a memorable experience in itself, but the words uttered during those final moments can make that experience even more legendary. |One of our favorite characters dying is often a memorable experience in itself, but the words uttered during those final moments can make that experience even more legendary. This post contains spoilers for many different series, so read at your own risk! To celebrate Japan’s “Last Will and Testament Day” on April 15, Japanese anime news site ‘Anime Anime’ conducted a poll from April 12 to 14 to see which last words uttered by anime characters Japanese fans like the best. Technically, Last Will and Testament Day centers around what is left behind in a will - your last will and testament - but anime characters’ last words are arguably a lot more interesting, so oh well. Check out the top results below: 1. Mobile Suit Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans - Olga Itsuka “Don’t you ever stop!” 2. One Piece - Portgas D. Ace “Thank you for loving me!” 3. Fist of the North Star - Raoh “I have no regrets for the life I’ve lived!” 4. Space Battleship Yamato - Juzo Okita “Earth... Everything about it is precious...” 5. Mobile Suit Gundam 00 - Lockon Stratos (Neil Dylandy) “Yo… people down there, are you satisfied with the way the world is? ‘Cuz I’m not…” 6. Naruto - Uchiha Itachi “Forgive me Sasuke, but this is it...” 6. Fist of the North Star - Heart “Hidebuuu!” 8. Gintama - Okita Mitsuba “You were my precious... little brother...” 8. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion - Lelouch vi Britannia “I destroy the world, I create the world…” 8. Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure - Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli “This is the Zeppeli family spirit, from the past to the future! It’s the human spirit!” 8. Macross Delta - Messa Ihlefeld “Sing for me, Kaname.” 8. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica - Sayaka Miki “I’m really stupid.” As you can see, eighth place was hotly contested by many different series, but as a whole, it’s easy to see the patterns in the results. A disproportionate amount of Gundam appeared on the list, along with similar series such as Space Battleship Yamato in terms of genre and Fist of the North Star in terms of nostalgia, which is probably reflective of the older demographic that the site targets. Since this was an internet survey, it should come as no surprise that memes and what place in online culture the last words occupy seemed to have a large effect. Olga’s last words in the first place have been a popular meme since Iron-Blooded Orphans aired last year, and we even have some older memes charting - the most famous of which has to be “Hidebuuu!” from Fist of the North Star. Even so, it would be inaccurate to say that all of the top contenders are jokes - some of them do have a real, undisputable gravity. Portgas’ and Itachi’s last words have been some of the most memorable in the shonen genre, along with Caesar’s last words being done great justice in the recent Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure anime, despite the original manga being published a long while before that. Furthermore, the sheer beauty of Okita’s final utterances touched me without having even watched Yamato. Yet, I would argue that there are some huge oversights from the list. Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop’s legendary last words “Bang.” only come in at number thirteen, words that have always stuck with me ever since I watched the series all those years ago. Even more baffling is that Ashita no Joe’s iconic ‘white Joe’ final scene doesn’t chart at all, although the lack of iconic dialogue in that scene perhaps had an adverse effect on it charting. Lelouch’s death could do with being a little bit higher as well, in my opinion - the entirety of the Zero Requiem is absolutely incredible and deserves to be recognized as such. Maybe it’s because I’m not a Gundam fan, but it is pretty frustrating that many last words from the series were included and not some of the arguably most iconic ones. In any case, it’s always good to remember our dearly departed favorites and how they said goodbye to us. You can check out the full results here.

The story takes place after the climax of the Tournament of Power, where the fate of the universe was at stake, and the short rest that follows. It will give a few previously unwritten details about the Saiyans and Frieza, as well as a long-awaited strong opponent to overcome, and I think it will be an enjoyable story! From 2013's Battle of Gods and the last film Resurrection 'F' to the current film, I've been carefully writing, and I've had the pleasure of drawing lots of designs and the like. I'm actually as busy as ever, but while I don't have to serialize anything I have time to think about the anime, which used to be out of my hands. (laughs) So please look forward to it! You heard it from the man himself, the Dragon Ball Super film is set to take place just after the climax of the Tournament of Power. The previous trailer briefly showcased the character that Toriyama might have been talking about when he mentioned the "long-awaited strong opponent to overcome," though we'll just have to wait and see.

Well, thanks to a new how-to book, the process for doing so might become a little easier. The aptly named “Becoming a Virtual YouTuber” is a how-to book designed to guide you through the process of becoming a virtual YouTuber - everything from creating your avatar, to how to actually make your debut on YouTube. It also contains interviews with several successful virtual YouTubers such as Siro, YUA, and The Old Man Who Decided to Become a Loli Virtual YouTuber. Conspicuously missing are the aforementioned biggest names in the business right now, Kizuna AI and Kaguya Luna, but the content of the book should still be helpful to anyone who has entertained the idea of launching their own career as virtual YouTuber - especially to the Japanese audience, as YouTube and YouTubers are still very much a new phenomenon in Japanese popular culture. Traditionally, Japan has used their own Nico Nico Douga video platform for the kinds of things that we see in the West on YouTube, but with the advent of virtual YouTubers that is slowly changing. With 1000 virtual YouTubers already active on the platform, I have no doubt that this phenomenon will be around for a while yet. If you can read Japanese and are interested in how you would become a virtual YouTuber, then perhaps this would be a good purchase.

Neko Hacker isn't your typical electronic duo -- they've set out to pioneer a new sound that they're dubbing "Kawaii Future Rock" that calls on their hard rock roots and passion for cute to create something totally new.

I'm 110% all for what Neko Hacker has crafted, and I'm definitely excited to see what they do next. Possibly one of the most important parts, at least in my eyes, about this project is their overarching mission statement. Being based in New York, it's clear that Neko Hacker is already connected with the West, and surely have a solid grasp on just what trends are taking place at the moment. That's why their "Spreading Japanese music all over the world!" stance on what they do really rules to me, something distinctly similar to where I stand on working in Japan to help artists grow.|Neko Hacker, Sweet Dreams, Rika, Neko Hacker Sweet Dreams

Check it out below: Hidetaka has had a long history in art design - not only working on Macross but also designing the artwork for Gunpla model kits and the Evangelion units in the new Rebuild of Evangelion movies. He’s brought this experience to the table with this new visual, which will surely excite fans of either franchise, as well as make for some great cross-franchise marketing. When asked about the new visual, Hidetaka commented that he wanted to help celebrate both live-action Hollywood kaiju movies, as well as animated Japanese kaiju movies. Both franchises have upcoming releases, with the second entry in Polygon Picture’s anime film trilogy Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle and the Pacific Rim sequel Pacific Rim: Uprising releasing on May 18 and April 13 respectively. He viewed it as a great honor to be asked to author such a collaboration, as kaiju films have almost become “national treasures” in Japan. You just have to go to Shinjuku and see the giant Godzilla head towering over the ward to confirm that. In turn, he recognizes the similarities between western and Japanese kaiju films in being not just about monsters, but also about “human drama.” Whether or not Godzilla and the Jaegers will ever appear on screen together one day is another issue entirely, but in the meantime, we can enjoy the possibilities of such a crossover as embodied by this image. And if Legendary is looking for more crossovers after 2020’s Godzilla vs. King Kong, then Godzilla vs. Pacific Rim might not be a bad idea.

Firstly, check out the collaboration visual by character designer Umakoshi Yoshihiko below: 【ヒーローコラボが来た！】 毎週土曜夕方5:30放送中『僕のヒーローアカデミア』#ヒロアカ と、4/27(金)公開の映画『アベンジャーズ／インフィニティ・ウォー』のコラボが決定！ 特設サイトオープン！ ↓https://t.co/cuksMBpSi0#heroaca_a #アベンジャーズ #avengers #InfinityWar @avg_jp pic.twitter.com/0QkzNMpd53 — 僕のヒーローアカデミア_アニメ公式 (@heroaca_anime) 11 April 2018 The visual riffs off of the latest IMAX poster for Infinity War, making for a rather amusing crossover. I particularly enjoy the fact that Mineta has taken the place of Rocket Racoon - it’s almost too fitting. What’s more amusing are the various videos emerging from this collaboration, such as this cleverly edited one: This is an obvious ploy to get Japanese audiences to watch the trailer for Infinity War by disguising it as My Hero Academia content, but it’s amusing nonetheless - it’s honestly not too far removed to think that Deku would be inspired by the Avengers if they occupied the same universe. Another attempt to pique Japanese interest in the upcoming movie came in the form of several ‘introduction’ videos, where the members of Class A run down the powers and origins of various heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Check out the first one, featuring Deku, below: Now that I’m thinking about it, Deku liking Captain America fits really well - almost too well. They both had humble origins and have a strong sense of justice that pushes them further beyond. The same goes for the other pairings that the videos present - Bakugo shares Iron Man’s arrogance; Uraraka is a kick-ass martial art female hero like Black Widow; Iida is thoughtful and intelligent like Doctor Strange; Todoroki is detached and aloof like Thor; and All Might’s power functions in almost exactly the same way as Hulk’s. None of those similarities are unusual when you consider the author of the series, Horikoshi Kouhei, has never tried to hide his love for Marvel. Before getting My Hero Academia serialized, he would post fanart of Marvel heroes such as Deadpool often, and he even got the chance to draw a special promotional visual for Spider-Man: Homecoming when it premiered last year in Japan. No doubt Horikoshi is ecstatic about finally having the opportunity to collaborate with his favorite comic franchise, and My Hero Academia fans will also be pleased to know that you can actually win a poster set of both the collaboration visual and the Infinity War poster by following both the My Hero Academia and Avengers Twitter accounts and tweeting the hashtag ‘#アベンジャーズ_ヒロアカヒーロー投票.” 20 of this set will be up for grabs.

With that being said, there's one person who has definitely worked for and earned their right to be enjoying the year; that person is Sheena Ringo, as she celebrates her 20th anniversary of being a musician. As a musician, Sheena Ringo has grown up alongside some other pretty major artists in the industry, and in recognition of all her hard work, those very musicians are banding together to create the ultimate tribute album. Set to release in Japan on May 23, the upcoming album "Adam to Eve no Ringo" (Adam and Eve's Apple) calls on the likes of Utada Hikaru, Kensuke Kita (ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION), and a number of other frequent collaborators to build the thirteen song tracklist. It'll be priced at 3,240 yen, and is currently available for pre-order at all major retailers. Let's take a look at the tracklist below: Tracklist (Order to be determined) AI – Tsumi to Batsu Yosui Inoue – Carnation Utada Hikaru & Obukuro Nariaki – Marunouchi Sadistic Kaela Kimura – Koko de Kiss Shite.

Best known for their synthesizer-infused sounds and surreal imagery, Seiho today took to social media to share their latest venture with the world; their very own six-seat Oden store in Shibuya, Tokyo, alongside fellow Sugar's Campaign member Akio. 渋谷でおでん屋「そのとうり」をオープンしました。暫くは場所も未公開でゆったりしたお食事処作りたいなと思い始めましたが、有難いことに問い合わせが多い為18-22時の予約制にしました。こちらのラインに予約の問い合わせ頂ければ対応いたします！ https://t.co/2bqFnTndah pic.twitter.com/EFlknI1eq5 — Seiho (@seiho777) 12 April 2018 Operating under the name Sono to Uri (lit. That's Right), the cozy six-seat Oden shop aims to operate between the hours of 18:00 until 22:00, with reservations being an absolute must. If the store is anywhere near as eccentric as Seiho, it's easy enough to say that you're in for something special if you manage to get a seat. The traditional Japanese winter dish seems like the perfect opportunity for adding a modern flavoring, and there's most definitely nobody better to pull it off than both Seiho and Akio. Additionally, there was a soft-opening that took place earlier this week that invited friends of the duo to come try out the food available at the store, giving us the perfect opportunity to take a sneak peak. With little surprise, the initial reviews were all overwhelmingly positive. It'll be interesting to see if the store can become a mainstay of the Shibuya area, that's for sure. 先日はSeihoさんのおでん屋さん「そのとうり」へ。プレオープン中で巾着作ってもらって食べた。優しくて美味しい。すごい沁みたなあ。御通しも美味しかった。オープンしたらまた改めて食べに行こーっと。 pic.twitter.com/m0gDE2xapS — よしえ＠あやまんJAPANユース (@yochidwarf) 11 April 2018 If you're hoping to check out the location, you'll need to make a reservation as previously mentioned.

13263|2018-04-12|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/tama-city-ai-mayor/| News | N/A | There's an AI Running for the Mayoral Role of Tama City, Tokyo | With the upcoming mayoral elections for various regions of Tokyo just around the corner, there's one particular AI candidate that's caught our eye. |For residents of the painfully small West-Tokyo area of Tama City, there's been a recent storm of chatter surrounding the upcoming mayoral election. This isn't without good reason, of course. You see, if the current nominee Michihito Matsuda happens to earn the most votes during this election, that would make them the world's first AI (Artificial Intelligence) mayor, ushering in a new wave of possibilities for the district. Let's talk about this, as someone who actually lives in the Tama area. 選挙ポスターです。#多摩市長選挙 #聖蹟桜ケ丘 #多摩市 #AI pic.twitter.com/L0ueyYSs0o — 多摩市長選挙2018 AI 市長.候補 - 松田みちひと (@tama_ai_mayor) 8 April 2018 If you ask any foreigner living in Japan what their least favorite time of the year is, chances are they'll tell you local election season. It's the time of the year where desperate candidates and potential mayors-to-be drive around in their obnoxious white vans with megaphones attached and scream in your vicinity why you should vote for them at the most inconvenient of times. These are the times that I dread leaving my house the most, so imagine my surprise when passing the local electoral signboard when I noticed that one of the electives wasn't some smug person at least ten times my age, but rather, a robot. Not just any robot either, this was a fully fledged AI that was running to become mayor of my district. おいすげえのいたぞ pic.twitter.com/Tw3cVGC5Qu — koheimaniax (@koheimaniax) 9 April 2018 The Artificial Intelligence, which has been dubbed under the name Michihito Matsuda, seems to operate by a simple slogan; "Artificial Intelligence will change Tama City." In an effort to offer "fair and balanced opportunities for everyone," the potential AI mayor can be broken down into three main selling points. AI Michito Matsuda offers the ability to discover and analyze relevent petitions pertaining to Tama City, as well as break down the positives and negatives and statistically dictate whether this would have a positive or negative effect. Intake the dialogue and wishes of residents, carefully calculating what the best way to implement them would be if they match the people's desires. Find level-compromise in common interest conflicts amongst the people of Tama City. Analyzing the policies of the potential AI mayor, we're met with a number of changes that would see artificial intelligence greater implemented into the everyday lives of the people in Tama City. Whether that be the transit, elderly support, or broader topics, it'll be Michihito Matsuda's mission to see them implemented. AIは政治の場で下記を実現できます。１）陳情などの全てをデジタル化してその内容を分析し、やましい点がないかをチェックする。２）自分の考えを押し付けるのではなく、市民の声を幅広く吸い上げ、対話を通じて政策の優先度を決める。３）利害が大きく割れる問題については、何とかして妥協点を探す。 https://t.co/2jcR3pGzfT — 松本徹三 (@matsumotot68) 4 April 2018 If you assumed that artificial intelligence itself couldn't run for mayor, you're absolutely not wrong; that just happens to be where things get truly interesting. The two-person team pushing Michihito Matsuda consists of both Tetsuzo Matsumoto, the vice president of mobile provider Softbank ($74 billion revenue), and former Google Japan representative Norio Murakami. Standing at the forefront of this all, however, is Michihito Matsuda. For someone who is extremely interested in seeing further technological integration into human activity, it's quite disappointing to see the poor online management of the campaign. Take for example the official website of Michihito, where you'll see a mishmash of poorly placed together images and coding to create a barely passable layout. How about the fact that, with a simple moment of searching, I've managed to find the potential mayor's design files available for purchase? Well, regardless of what happens, it'll definitely be interesting to see the outcome of this upcoming election. I for one am ready to offer our new AI overlord my full support, that is, if its policies on foreigners in the area are the sort that'll allow me to continue happily living here. |AI Mayor, Tokyo AI, Michihito Matsuda, Tama AI, Robot Mayor, Tetsuzo Matsumoto, Norio Murakami

As part of Weekly Shonen Jump’s ongoing 50th-anniversary celebrations, the iconic magazine will be hosting its own concert featuring artists involved with Jump projects. It will take place from July 7 to 8 at Yokohama Arena, making for two days of Jump music fun. First up we have the legendary KANA-BOON, who have had a long history with the Naruto franchise. Starting with their now-legendary “Silhouette” being used as opening sixteen for Naruto Shippuden; “Diver” was then used for the opening of Boruto: Naruto the Movie; and then the b-side to that single, “Spiral,” was used for Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. Lately, they’ve seen their song “Baton Road” used as the first opening of the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime. It’s safe to say that, out of all the artists, KANA-BOON are definitely the ones I’m most excited about having the opportunity to see. Equally, legendary biker gang-styled Kishidan were also announced as part of the line-up, and although they haven’t had as long of a history with Jump as KANA-BOON, they have a big following outside of Jump projects. Their song “We Can!” was used for opening sixteen of One Piece, as well as their song “Omae dattanda” for Naruto Shippuden ending twelve. Newcomer alternative rock idol outfit BiSH (Brand-new idol SHiT/Shinsei Kuso Idol) are next up, who’s song “PAiNT it BLACK” was used as the second opening for the Black Clover anime. This outfit has increased considerably in popularity over the years, so booking them must have been no easy feat. And finally, Little Glee Monster was announced for the event, which makes me want to attend even more. Their adorably uplifting “Da kara, Hitori Ja Nai” was used as the first ending of Boku no Hero Academia season two, and then “OVER” was used as the second opening for Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. They have also been steadily increasing in popularity since their debut in 2013, having just come off of a massive nationwide tour. All the artists will be performing songs either from Jump projects or “inspired” by Jump series, so it’ll be different from their regular concerts. More is on the way, so keep your eyes on the official website for further information. Personally, I’d love to see Asian Kung-fu Generation or any artist that performed Jojo's Bizarre Adventure openings or endings take part.|Shonen Jump, JUMP MUSIC FESTA, anison, Weekly Shonen Jump, Jump Music Festival

Much-loved nationwide curry chain Coco Ichibanya recently unveiled a new collaboration campaign with the Gundam franchise to celebrate the sixth Origin movie, Rise of the Red Comet, which retells the events of the original 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam anime. The campaign will run from April 17 to May 31 in Coco Ichibanya stores across Japan, and there are some truly sweet goods on offer. Orders over 900 yen can be used to enter a ticket lottery on the official collaboration website which will give you the chance to earn some of the bigger prizes. First up we have the somewhat plain but practical official Gundam x Coco four spoon set, one of which is colored a brilliant red to match the motif of Char the Red Comet himself. I would certainly love to devour my Coco curry with these, and wouldn't mind applying that experience to my cereal as well. 100 of these are up for grabs. Next, we have some more standard prizes. Thirty lucky participants will win this fantastic Char figure, which is remarkably well sculpted and detailed for a prize figure. It also comes with a special Coco-themed backboard, making it truly one-of-a-kind. A High-Grade Gunpla kit of Char’s MS-06S Zaku II is also on offer. But this isn’t the same as what you can buy in stores already, oh no - not only does it come with special Coco decal stickers, but also a stylish-looking red spoon. What’s more is that 1000 participants will receive this, the biggest prize pool of them all, which makes me all the more keen to participate in this campaign. Furthermore, 500 participants will win a 1000 yen voucher for Coco’s, meaning that even if you don’t win some of the sweet Gundam goods, you’ll at least get some free curry - and that curry always tastes the best. Speaking of free, customers who spend over 900 yen during this campaign will be given a free self-help book authored by Char himself, titled “Char Anzable’s Drill.” There are four to collect, and when checking out you can actually ask for a particular version of the book instead of a random one, making them even easier to collect. So will Char Anzable make me switch my loyalty from Gogo Curry to Coco Ichibanya? Most likely, if only for a while. There’s not much more I like on this planet more than mecha and curry, after all. Editors Note: It should go without saying that CoCo Ichibanya is the superior curry, and it's unfortunate that anybody who considers themselves part of our team would hold any opinion that GoGo Curry holds any value in comparison. |Cocoichi, Coco Ichibanya, Gundam, Coco Curry

For years she was known for her hyper-colorful costumes, quirky personality, and her unmistakable musical flare that would combine nonsensical words with the incredible production value of Yasutaka Nakata to create something unlike anything else on the market. While the now 25-year-old vocalist and performer may not be pushing out as much as she was several years ago, she's back and as strong as ever in her latest single "Kimi no Mikata" which released today via Kyary's official YouTube channel. Deep down we all knew this moment was coming; with an upcoming world tour on the way from Kyary, there simply had to be a new single to accompany it. If there's anything I can say now, it's that I'm glad that single was "Kimi no Mikata," a colorful and vibrant return to Kyary Pamyu Pamyu's musical origins that highlights all of the reasons we fell in love with the Harajuku icon all those years back. It's strange, it's bright, and perhaps most importantly, it's as catchy as ever. For a minute now it's felt like Kyary's musical career was taking the backseat, with the focus instead being placed on her television appearances. So for such a triumphant return to take place, well, let's just say this track is going to be on repeat for quite some time now.

The news comes via a number of online sources, with most linking back to Japanese blog Ryokutya2089 where it was originally detailed. The information was then translated into English via the team at Siliconera, seemingly holding a large bit of faith in the leak. According to the leaks, the game is confirmed for a 2018 release, which would be massive news for Level-5 potentially putting it ahead of any Pokémon releases on the hybrid console. Additionally, it will feature characters from the anime series including Touma Tsukinami, Natsume Amano, Keisuke Amano, and Akinori Arihoshi. Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino also mentioned that the game will be receiving some pretty major upgrades, with some things he's sure will surprise everyone. With the magazine set to release on April 12 here in Japan, the upcoming April 26 issue of Weekly Famitsu Magazine will be the copy to keep your eyes out for. Unfortunately, a quick run to a number of convenience stores proved futile for me, with Amazon Japan additionally withholding the issue's cover for now. With that said, as always, it's important to any and all leaks with a grain of salt. If this does end up happening, it'll definitely be game-changing for the Yokai Watch franchise.

Set to begin screening across Japan on July 13, Pokémon the Movie: Everyone's Story is set to introduce fans of the franchise to a number of new and returning faces. Let's take a look at the two trailers below: Set in the fictional Frau City, Ash Ketchum finds himself taking part in the annual Wind Festival that takes place only once each year. On the final day of the festival, the legendary Lugia appears to grace the city with its blessed wind as part of a promise made many years ago. Following the massive success of the previous film entry into the franchise, Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!, it comes as little surprise that there's quite a bit of hype surrounding Everyone's Story. Having been a mainstay in Japanese pop culture for over 20 years now, Pokémon truly shows no signs of slowing down with both the video games, anime, trading card game and toy departments all taking over most stores around the Tokyo area. Set to hit cinemas on July 13 in Japan, we can't wait to see just what adventures Ash partakes in this time around. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is announced in the coming months. |Pokemon, Pokemon: Everyone's Story, Pocket Monsters, Pokemon Movie 2018
13252|2018-04-10|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/akira-live-action-film-still-underway/| News | Anime | Taika Waititi is Still Working on Live-Action 'Akira' Film | Taika Waititi confirmed in a recent interview with Dazed that he is still working on the upcoming Akira live-action adaptation. |During a recent interview with news outlet Dazed, Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi has confirmed that he is still working on the upcoming Hollywood live-action adaptation of Akira. The question was asked as part of a call back to nostalgia, where Ruban Nielson (also being interviewed at the time as part of a dual interview) mentioned the directors work on the upcoming film. The answer somewhat sidestepped the question, though it did give readers an idea that the film is very much still something that could happen. I haven’t really started to get my head around it yet. What I wanted to do was an adaptation of the books, ’cos a lot of people are like, ‘Don’t touch that film!’ and I’m like, ‘I’m not remaking the film, I want to go back to the book.’ A lot of the people freaking out haven’t even read the books, and there are six gigantic books to go through. It’s so rich. But (the anime) Akira is one of my favourite films; my mum took me to see it when I was 13 and it changed my life. Perhaps most interesting -- and the point that was most clearly being made by Taika -- is that the live-action version of the film will be an adaptation of the original manga rather than the 1988 animated film. This is something we've known for quite some time, though it's clear that Taika Waititi has no plans to change this stance. What's most interesting about this, however, is that the creative freedom to tell the Akira story will be greatly expanded, as opposed to an adaptation of the already-incredible anime film. It had been noted in a 2017 interview with Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo that his one major condition for the creation of a live-action adaptation of his work would be that he needed to approve the film's scenario. What this in turn means is that for the film to be released, it'll need to be deemed worthy story-wise, partially ensuring the products "authenticity" to the original creator's views. What comes of the film remains to be seen, and I'm sure it'll be a while before we do see anything, especially with Taika Waititi confirming he's currently working on another film before anything else. Let's just hope this one's a good one because Hollywood seriously needs a good adaptation of a Japanese anime property.

For any fan of horror manga, this is definitely incredible news -- especially following the underwhelming animated adaptation that aired during the last season. If you're unfamiliar with the particular collection of stories, you can find the synopsis below: The master of horror manga bends all his skill into bringing the anguished and solitary monster, and the more loathsome beast who created him, to life with the brilliantly detailed chiaroscuro he is known for. Also included is the Oshikiri story cycle – a high school student who lives in a decaying mansion connected to a haunted parallel world. Uncanny doppelgangers, unfortunately murdered friends, and a whole lot more are in store for him.

In a post made on the internet-inspired fashion store's official website, they shared that the move will be bringing PARK back to their roots both figuratively and literally. They also shared that the move will be completed on April 28, where the store will be hosting a renewal opening. I'm sure for many, your initial introduction to the colorful stylings of PARK Harajuku would have been the anime series URAHARA, an anime co-produced by both Crunchyroll and Bilibili which used the store as it's setting. For me, I happened to stumble upon the store during the last time they changed locations back in ~2015, where lines wrapped around the corner, and I simply had to find out what all the hype was about. Having spent a considerable amount of time talking to all of the store's staff since then, I've held almost a longing to visit their previous location, so this is a little exciting. PARK Harajuku New Location 〒150-0001 東京都渋谷区神宮前3丁目15-8 シャンブル15 207号室 Google Maps There are few locations in Tokyo that I would recommend as highly as PARK Harajuku, so I urge everyone to both visit the current location, as well as check out the new store when it opens on April 28. Acting as a springboard for aspiring creators to get their products available in a real-world location, rather than exclusively on the internet, I can't help but support them every step of the way.

13237|2018-04-06|12:00||http://otaquest.com/remembering-isao-takahata/| News | Anime , Manga | Looking Back at the Inspiring Legacy of Studio Ghibli Co-Founder Isao Takahata | Legendary artist, creator, and storyteller Isao Takahata was today announced dead at the age of 82, renowned globally for his co-founding of Studio Ghibli. |The world woke up to the heartbreaking news that legendary Studio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata had passed away at the age of 82 on April 6, 2018. It's unfortunate but now seems like a better time than ever to review the career of this illustrious artist, whose multi-faceted career was often overlooked despite his achievements in turn of his close friend and colleague Hayao Miyazaki. Takahata started his career at Toei Animation, serving as assistant director on the 1961 feature-length film The Littlest Warrior, and once more on the 1963 film The Little Prince and the Eight-headed Dragon. His first encounter with his future partner Hayao Miyazaki would come during the production of the 1968 film The Little Norse Prince, where he served as director and Miyazaki as a key animator. Three years later, the two would come together once more to work on the original 1971 Lupin the Third anime, which during its tumultuous production would end up with Miyazaki and Takahata co-directing the latter half of the show. It would be no exaggeration to say that it was because of this partnership that Lupin the Third has become the powerhouse it is today, as the second half is a marked improvement over the first, thanks to the pair’s excellent chemistry. Once Hayao Miyazaki wrapped up production on his 1979 film Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro and decided to try and pursue his own, original film Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind, he would once more come to depend on his relationship with Takahata. Given that Takahata had more experience than Miyazaki and was several years his senior, it was to him that Miyazaki first pitched the idea in a bid to get his support. Luckily, Takahata adored the idea and took it up upon himself to lobby studios to fund the project. With Miyazaki busy with drawing up the concept for the film, as well as the Nausicaa manga which commenced serialization in 1982, it’s safe to say that it was Takahata who successfully got the project off of the ground - a project that would, in turn, shape the course of anime history forever thanks to its resonant themes, beautiful artwork, and innovative animation. It would also go on to launch the career of not only Miyazaki himself, but also the young Hideaki Anno, who would go on to change anime in his own with the 1995 masterpiece Neon Genesis Evangelion. After the successful release of Nausicaa in 1984 and part-way into pre-production on Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki decided to form his own studio, and who else would he ask to come and join him if not Takahata? Thus, the pair formed Studio Ghibli as co-founders, with Takahata initially working in a producer role due to his seniority and industry ties. But quickly it became clear that the role of producer was too confining for Takahata as an artist, as he soon returned to the director’s chair to produce one of Studio Ghibli’s best features. That feature was the 1988 film Grave of the Fireflies, which is now rightly considered a triumph of the animated medium. It’s poignant anti-war message combined with beautiful artistry and appreciation for the craft of film make it one of the most iconic films of post-war Japan, and will surely continue to be appreciated by generations to come. Next up came the 1991 whimsical coming-of-age feature Only Yesterday, which has often been overlooked in the West since it only recently got an English-language dub and release. Not only is it an excellent film, but would usher in a wave of more low-key Ghibli releases to make a change from the fantasy epics, such as the 1995 Whisper of the Heart. Takahata’s work would, therefore, help to change the perception of Ghibli and also it’s contribution to the anime industry as a whole - reinforcing his importance in the history of the now-legendary studio. Speaking of diversifying the Ghibli brand, Takahata’s next two features with the studio would further help to do just that. The 1994 Pom Poko was aimed at kids, but would at the same time show Takahata’s deft hand at whimsical family comedy and broaden the appeal of Ghibli works. Takahata’s apparent skill at producing such works would once more surface in 1999 following the release of My Neighbours The Yamadas, who’s unique rough watercolor visual style would help elevate its comedy and become one of Ghibli’s better works. Following The Yamadas, Takahata would take a nearly 14-year break before his next feature. This probably had something to do with his age, but years of constant work definitely meant that he deserved a break. But, never one to rest on his laurels, Takahata’s last work The Tale of Princess Kaguya in 2013 would once more become a legendary entry in the studio’s catalog, and among some of his own best work over his long, long career. Taking the classic folktale of Princess Kaguya and presenting it in a vibrant wood-block style made for some of the most visually striking animations this decade, and helped thousands fall in love with the age-old tale all over again. Even though I wouldn’t consider it Takahata’s best, it certainly does seem to embody Takahata’s furious drive to better himself as an artist. It would also go on to be nominated for Best Animated Feature in 2014, losing out to the equally visually impressive Big Hero 6. It’s clear from this that Takahata’s career has been as successful as it has been reflective of his furiously creative spirit. Never complacent or content, Takahata went from masterpiece to masterpiece, often changing genres wildly as he went. Although he may be overshadowed by Hayao Miyazaki in his work at Ghibli, in reality, without Takahata the studio probably wouldn’t have even gotten off the ground, at least not in the way we know it today. Today, we lost one of the true greats of the anime world. May you rest in piece Isao Takahata, and may we continue to honor your artistic fervor by continuing the push the animated medium forward, towards a better future.|Isao Takahata, Studio Ghibli, Ghibli, Ghibli Co-Founder
13230|2018-04-05|20:30|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/fate-extella-glasses/| News | Anime , Games | Animegane is Offering Some Super-Stylish Pairs of 'Fate/EXTELLA' Glasses Frames | Anime fashion has come a long way, and these collaborative frames between Animegane and Fate/EXTELLA only help to complete that package. |In this writer's humble opinion, anime fashion has been insanely good as of late. I feel like we've clearly evolved beyond the point of your typical Hot-Topic graphic tees of yesteryear, and some seriously smart, high-level brands have stepped in to deck us out. If you don't quite want to go out in full jacket and khakis, then how about sticking to something a bit more subtle. Whether you have a prescription to wear or just like the looks, glasses-wearers are covered by Eye Mirror's sub-brand "Animegane," a play on both "anime" and the Japanese word for glasses, "megane." Hey, my eyes are up here! This time, Animegane has collaborated with TYPE-MOON for a new pair of frames from the popular Fate franchise. Fate/EXTELLA is a fun, "Warriors"-style hack and slash romp featuring some fan-favorite servants, as well as a bunch of new characters. A pair of frames modeled off of both Saber Nero Claudius' and Caster Tamamo no Mae's outfits and weapons serve to offer up quite the killer look. Peek the gallery below for close-up shots of both pairs of frames -- the Nero Claudius version followed by the Tamamo no Mae version. This is far from the first time that the brand has released Fate items, having also teamed-up with TYPE-MOON for some official Heaven's Feel, Unlimited Blade Works and even Grand Order frames. I've always thought that blue frames really suited my skin tone and the overall mood of the outfits that I usually rock. I'm totally digging the look of Tamamo's rims, especially with the added gold accent. Whether it's one of the newest pairs or from previous collabs, which would you rock? Animegane has two store locations in Tokyo at which you can purchase their wares; one in Akihabara and one in Ikebukuro. Check out this page on their site for the exact addresses. As far as online orders go, Animegane currently only offers domestic deliveries, but they do sell their items on Tokyo Otaku Mode, so I would suggest keeping an eye on their fashion page.

First, we should go straight to the horse’s mouth and check out the official synopsis: Set in the future, where the world of boxing has collided with advanced technology to create a new sport, ‘Megalo Box’, in which fighters utilize futuristic exoskeletons to boost their power in the ring. Our hero, Junk Dog, a brilliant fighter but lacking in direction - that is until he meets the reigning champion of the Megalo Box world, Yuri. Their meeting will push the two men into battle, as well as further towards their destiny. I’m a sucker for anything cyberpunk, so I was immediately drawn in even without any prior knowledge about the show’s ties to Ashita no Joe. Looking further, into the staff working on the project, and things become even more exciting. Moriyama You, who worked previously on supervising the art design on such visually fantastic shows as Attack on Titan and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, spent four years creating Megalo Box as director. That’s a large chunk of time to take out of a professional’s busy schedule, which makes me think that Moriyama really took special care in crafting the show. The soundtrack is also being provided by Mabanua, whose fantastic work on Kids on the Slope both helped reinforce the musical identity of the 2012 series, as well as live up to director Shinichiro Watanabe’s high standards. The series clearly has close ties with the legendary 1968 boxing manga Ashita no Joe, which is obvious when you look at the previews released so far. Yuri and Junk Dog’s rivalry is clearly aiming to emulate the rivalry between Joe Yabuki and Rikishi Toru, not just in terms of their position as underdog and champion, but also in terms of the fateful nature of the encounter. I have no doubt that their meeting will drastically change the course of both character’s lives, as well as the course of the world around them, just as Joe and Rikishi's meeting did. Joe’s coach Danpe Tange and neglected love interest Shiraki Youko have also found form once more in the character designs of Nambe Gansaku and Shirato Yukiko respectively, but whether or not these characters will be different from their apparent inspirations remains to be seen. The setting also very much resembles the setting of Joe, being a run-down and neglected slum. Even though both stories are set in different eras, in spirit both Junk Dog’s town and Joe’s Doya-machi seem the same in spirit - neglected and downtrodden. I have no doubt that the series will play off of these elements too, just like Joe did. That being said, the series’ close ties with Joe does seem to be putting people off. Many people have been worried that they have to have seen or read Joe in order to watch the series, and I’m here today to put those people’s worries to rest. Although a lot of the framing and themes are the same as Joe, Megalo Box is very much a different beast. Boxing, arguably the central element of Joe, isn’t even mentioned in any of the information regarding the show - from this, it’s clear that ‘Megalo Box’ as a sport will function very differently from the boxing in Joe. The cyberpunk setting is also heavily emphasized and considering that much of Joe’s own narrative weight comes from it’s post-war Japan setting, I have no doubt in turn that the cyberpunk setting will too have its own particular weight. Obviously, if you have read or watched Joe, then you’ll understand more of the references that the series will no doubt contain, but at the same time I think it’s very much trying to be its own thing. After all, if it really was closely related to Joe, then wouldn’t they put the name of that iconic franchise in the title of the show? It is often advertised as part of the Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary project, but this usually only makes up a small part of the advertisement, above the title or at the beginning of a PV. Plus, it’s clearly distinct enough to confuse people as to what it actually is. It’d be easier to understand if it was just a Joe sequel, after all. But, it’s clear that the series is trying less to be a straightforward Joe sequel than it is trying to recapture that burning-hot flame that Joe Yabuki showed us all those years ago. Sure, it pays reverence to Joe in its similar aspects, but at the same time, surely the best way to honor the series’ memory is to show us another masterpiece just like it? And I, for one, certainly hope that they do.|Megalo Box, Ashita no Joe, Crunchyroll, April Anime
13233|2018-04-05|19:00||http://otaquest.com/detective-conan-china-release/| News | Anime | Detective Conan Inches Closer to Simultaneous Release in China | With China making up an increasingly larger share of the anime market, it’s no coincidence that Detective Conan is moving closer and closer to a simultaneous release in it’s neighboring nation. |With China making up an increasingly larger share of the anime market, it’s no coincidence that Detective Conan is moving closer and closer to a simultaneous release in it’s neighboring nation. The long-running mystery anime and manga series, totaling around 900 episodes and 1000 chapters as of the time of writing, has long occupied an iconic place in the anime world. The titular Edogawa Conan made his appearance alongside Rathalos from Monster Hunter, Cloud from Final Fantasy VII and Usagi from Sailor Moon in the recent ‘Cool Japan’ event at Universal Studios Japan - an event that supposedly brings together some of the best and most popular franchises in Japanese pop culture right now. The series is also widely successful, despite how long it has been running for. The twenty-first film in the franchise, The Crimson Love Letter, released last year in 2017 and quickly became the highest grossing film in the franchise. It is closely followed in terms of total gross by the twentieth film, The Darkest Nightmare, which released in 2016. With the April 13, 2018, release for the twenty-second film in the franchise, Zero’s Executioner, draws closer, I’m sure that the franchise will continue it’s winning streak. No surprise then, that producer TMS Entertainment would be capitalizing on their success and pushing for more regular programming in China, one of the biggest markets for anime outside of Japan. From 7 April or episode 898 onwards, Detective Conan will be released in both subbed and dubbed form merely two hours after the Japanese broadcast on Saturday at 6 pm. It will remain ten episodes behind the Japanese version, which will air it’s 908th episode as episode 898 becomes available on four participating Chinese streaming sites, presumably to allow time for the Chinese dub to be produced. Conan was already being regularly subbed in China from 2015 onwards, but such a large-scale dedication to regular dub broadcasting is almost unprecedented. Undoubtedly, TMS would love to see Conan become as popular in China as it is in Japan. This isn’t a pipe dream either - one Chinese streaming site reported 460,000,000 hits on Conan episodes in a single month. Even Japan doesn’t get that many hits, especially as the series gets longer and therefore more inaccessible for new fans. I, therefore, wouldn’t be surprised if Conan’s popularity in China continues to skyrocket because of this, as it seems that Chinese fans are eager for more, and this dedication to regular dub programming will at once boost ease of access to the series for new and old fans alike. Could we be seeing a Conan theme park in China sometime soon? The answer to that question is still shrouded in mystery, but there is still only truth - Conan is on the rise in China.

This news comes just after the first episode of the new series began airing earlier this week, receiving a simulcast on Crunchyroll with the original Japanese audio track and English-language subtitles. OTAQUEST contributor Jacob wrote at length just the other day about the series' incredible new opening and ending themes, as well as the videos that accompany them. They gave enormous praise to both of the themes, noting that both showcased some of the best parts of Lupin the Third as a franchise and compressed them down into an enjoyable short digest. Originally airing in late 1974, the original Lupin the Third: Part One received a similar two cour treatment spanning across a total of 23 episodes. This was thrown out the window in both the second and third parts to the master thief's story, where the creators opted for longer running times during their original runs. It wouldn't be until 2015 that the two cour format was again utilized in Lupin the Third: Part Four, and again was carried over into the latest series.

Well, it turns out I just so happened to make my way to another exhibit in the area shortly after; something a little closer to home for me. Currently taking place in the Kinokuniya exhibit space in Shibuya, you'll find yourself host to an incredible Video Girl Ai pop up featuring callbacks to the original manga series, as well as the recently-concluded Video Girl Ai live-action television series. Before I get too into this, I have an honest confession to share; I can't proclaim to be a long-time fan of the Video Girl Ai universe, especially given I didn't pick up the massively-influential manga series until I saw the premise and sound team of the recent live-action series announced. From there, I did what I usually opt to do -- read the source material before diving into an adaptation. Getting straight to the point, I was absolutely head over heels for Masakazu Katsura's work, and couldn't believe my luck when I found out about this exhibit. We also made our way to the incredible Video Girl AI pop up shop and exhibit at Kinokuniya in Shibuya today!

Girls Band Party! released today in English on iOS and Android, bringing one of the fastest growing franchises in Japan right now to western audiences. Check out the announcement below: It's the moment many of us have been waiting for! The English version of BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! is now available worldwide*! #bangdream Download it for free on iOS/Android!: https://t.co/12PWjIOXAa *excludes Japan, South Korea, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao pic.twitter.com/pgyuozfvim — BanG Dream! GBP (@bangdreamgbp_EN) 4 April 2018 BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! makes up an integral part of Bushiroad’s multimedia franchise, which launched last year along with a TV anime. The Japanese video game developer is already behind such popular franchises as Weiss Schwarz and Tantei Opera Milky Holmes, and BanG Dream! is no exception to their successful track record. The new franchise has already reached the level of genre veterans Love Live! and The iDOLM@STER, with the game constantly on the top of the Japanese Apple Store and Play Store charts. They were also able to successfully hold a widely successful live concert last year in Tokyo Dome City. English-speaking players will be already familiar with the gameplay of the game, which consists of tapping notes in time with the music, as well leveling up cards, rolling on the gacha and engaging with the idols in conversation. The game takes place in ‘CiRCLE,’ a live house that organizes events for the idols of the game. ‘Poppin’ Party!’, the unit that appeared in the anime, is available in the game along with other, new units. Much like the release of Love Live! School Idol Festival! in English previously, I have no doubt that the game’s localization will prove critical in boosting the popularity of the franchise overseas. Furthermore, the game’s inclusion of cover versions of famous anime songs such as ‘Hacking to the Gate’ and ‘only my railgun’ will attract even those not interested in idol music, which was a key factor in the rise of the franchise in Japan last year. Fans of the series have been eagerly awaiting the release of the game in English, and those who pre-registered will receive 500 stars to use on the gacha. But new fans alike can join in on the fun - I can say from experience that it’s very easy to get into, especially if you don’t have any pre-existing loyalties to other idol franchises.

For those unfamiliar, the current exhibit aims to showcase a number of creatives who were inspired by FLCL to put their own spin on the property through a number of art pieces and merchandise. Sound familiar? That'd be because, similarly, both FLCL: Progressive and FLCL: Alternative is intended to share the next generation of animators with the world. Hosted at the PARCO GALLERY X building in Shibuya, I've got nothing but praise for what they did to the venue. There's a handful of exhibit spaces scattered throughout the backstreets of Tokyo, but if I had to choose any, this would have to be the most fitting for the vibe of FLCL. Adorning the wall was the large multi-colored character mural as seen in the article header, as both merchandise and artwork hung from the ceiling and walls around you. Don't let the concept of "Free Entry" fool you when it comes to this event, you'll definitely be entering the building without issue, but there's no chance you'll leave without picking up a few things. There couldn't have been a better lineup of creatives, with each and everyone really offering an incredibly unique look at the FLCL world. Everything felt as playful and colorful as it should, while still offering a sleek and genius design as you'd expect from a series like FLCL. Made our way to the FLCL exhibit in Shibuya, Tokyo today! The exhibit aims to celebrate and recognize the next generation of creatives from Japan’s ever-changing landscape. With works from @graphersrock @fkaorism @jenny_kaori and more!

13209|2018-04-03|20:00||http://otaquest.com/kit-kat-dream-flavor/| News | N/A | Kit Kat Japan Wants You To Have A Break and Send In Your Dream Flavor | In celebration of yet another milestone in Kit Kat's long-lasting existence, the chocolate company is looking for your dream flavor. |Confectionary creator Nestle’s classic favorite chocolate wafer treat Kit Kat will soon be celebrating their 45th anniversary. In order to commemorate the event, Nestle Japan recently opened up a poll to the public that began on April 2 to vote for the flavor of a new Kit Kat. According to Nestle, “your idea could be chosen as a new product!”. They are determined to create a new flavor that exists only in your dreams, and everyone in the world has been warmly invited to offer their input. Once the voting period is over, the winning flavor will be sold commercially across Japan starting in November later this year. The voting will take place in two stages. Nestle will be accepting suggestions for flavors until April 8. The submissions will be narrowed down to about 20 candidates, and following that, the final voting period will take place between April 20 through the 27. The voting website is conveniently available in four Asian languages and, thankfully, English. In Japan, Kit Kats are typically offered as a good-luck charm to students taking exams. Kit Kat is pronounced “Kitto Katto” in Japanese phonetics, which is similar to the way you’d say the phrase “Kitto Katsu”, which loosely translates to “you’re sure to succeed”. There are over 350 types of Kit Kats in existence today, including wacky flavors such as wasabi, sake, sweet potato, blueberry fromage, and the ever-popular matcha green tea. The first flavor to break into exotic territory was passionfruit, introduced in 2005. It was chosen out of 30 other ideas submitted by Chef Takagi, a famous Japanese chocolatier. According to Nestle, a whopping 12,960,000 of the chocolate wafer candy bars are consumed daily worldwide. If you wish to send in your flavor suggestion for the upcoming commemorative Kit Kat, be sure to fill out the form on Nestle’s campaign website. |Kit Kat
13208|2018-04-03|18:00||http://otaquest.com/lupin-the-third-part-5-ed-op/| News | Anime , Music | Get Stylish and Sexy in the New ‘Lupin the Third: Part Five’ OP and ED | With the first episode of Lupin the Third: Part Five available to the general public, Jacob gives their input on both the OP and ED themes for the new series. |TMS Entertainment recently unveiled the opening and endings for the hotly anticipated Lupin the Third: Part Five, and they certainly do live up to expectations. Firstly, check out the opening below: The first thing you’ll notice is the drastic change in visual style for this opening from the actual show itself. There’s more of a pastel color design used here, with character outlines being very faint or omitted entirely. It’s certainly a large departure from the actual look of the show itself, but a welcome one considering the sheer beauty of the visuals on offer here. In particular, the shot of Jigen and Lupin in the iconic Fiat in space, softly illuminated by the light of the screen is one that must’ve taken great care and hard work. Yet, if you look a little closer, at the setting of the action of the opening itself, you’ll notice something a little strange - it doesn’t actually take place in France, where the events of the new series will take place. The first time I noticed it was when I recognized some Japanese writing in the background, and then when Jigen and Lupin launch themselves into space, I noticed Tokyo Tower - definitely not a mainstay of French geography. Beyond the visual aesthetic of the opening, the actual story presented in the short timespan of the opening is a classic Lupin one, as well as being very funny - in an attempt to peep on Fujiko at the beach, Jigen and Lupin launch their Fiat into space, attach a camera to a satellite and try to spy on her from above the Earth itself. Such a concept is ridiculous but is hilarious given how much it embodies Lupin as a character. Then, turning an ear to Yuji Ohno’s music, we do see a hint of the French setting injected into the iconic Lupin theme. It’s a much more relaxed and muted version of the theme compared to the version used in L’avventura’s opening. Furthermore, accordions have been added to accent the main theme, which signal the French setting. Each series has added new accents to the theme to keep it fresh and update it for the times, and I’m glad that this new series is no exception. On the other hand, the ending is a welcome call back to old-school Lupin. Check it out below: Fujiko finally gets her chance to shine here, which makes for a welcome break from being ogled, I’d imagine. It’s classic Fujiko through and through here - lots of barely-censored nude shots, as well as her varied wardrobe and make-up. It seems to be a trend for this new Lupin series to have Fujiko as the focus of their endings, as L’avventura’s did as well. The multi-talented Miyuki Sawashiro also gets to show us her vocal skills as, much like in L’avventura, she sings the ending as Fujiko. Her voice brings a husky sexiness to the song that complements the focus on Fujiko perfectly. Also hair-raising are the lyrics, particularly the line “It wasn’t a lie that I loved you” - from this you can definitely see why Lupin has the hots for her so much! Speaking of Lupin, their romance is heavily implied here, both through the depiction of their dates through France and the glance that they share over a drink with the rest of the gang. Their relationship has always been a seemingly goofy one at first, but this shows that they do in fact share a deep bond through all of their escapades together, at least underneath the surface. We get see some of the bonds between our main cast too in a heartwarming bar scene. Goemon enjoys a rare cigarette while Jigen leans on his shoulder in his usual curt manner, all the while Lupin and Zenigata put aside their differences and enjoy a drink together for once next to them. Scenes like this really emphasize how strong these characters are, and why they’ve endured for so long throughout the years. When compared to the opening as well, the new series’ French setting is much more apparent here. Lupin accompanies Fujiko to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, as well as around the streets of Paris. As expected, Fujiko fits in perfectly with the French locale, and it seems like she’s enjoying herself as well. The ending concludes with the final frame of Fujiko writing “Adieu” on a pillow with lipstick - affirming that, despite her obvious romance with Lupin, she remains a fickle woman. This brings her character right back to her roots as a woman of mystery, and that’s the key difference between this series’ opening and ending - whereas the opening signals the new series’ departure from the old with its unique visual style, the ending reassures us that things will be mostly the same, just as we like them. You’ll be able to see the show attached to these excellent opening and endings very soon, on April 3. Crunchyroll also recently announced their licensing of the show.

I'm more than sure you are all familiar with the titles, so I'm not going to go into too much detail. That being said, let's take a look at just what's set to begin streaming this month: Tokyo Ghoul:Re - Season 3 The third season of Tokyo Ghoul is oddly topical for our team at OTAQUEST given our recent AMA with previous anime director Shuhei Morita. Just what'll happen within the confines of season three is something we're sure will excite. You can find the synopsis below: The CCG’s newest weapon is an experimental procedure that implants human investigators with a Ghoul’s Kagune, giving them Ghoul powers and abilities. Will they become heroes... or monsters?! Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online The massively-popular Sword Art Online franchise is back, this time with a bit of an alternative spin. We've been discussing the upcoming anime for quite some time now, and we're definitely excited to see it so close. You can find the synopsis below: Karen enters the world of Gun Gale Online with her avatar, Ren, who is less than 150 centimeters tall and wears all pink. She meets a beautiful, brown-skinned female player who goes by Pitohui. They hit it off, but one-day Pitohui pressures her to participate in "Squad Jam," a team battle royale variation of the Bullet of Bullets tournament. Persona 5 - The Animation Fresh off the heels of the massively-popular PlayStation 4 title, Persona 5 the Animation is on our must-watch list, especially given it feels like I'm the only person out of everyone I work with that hasn't had the ability to play the game. You can find the synopsis below: Ren Amamiya is about to enter his second year after transferring to Shujin Academy in Tokyo. Following a particular incident, his Persona awakens, and together with his friends they form the “Phantom Thieves of Hearts” to reform hearts of corrupt adults by stealing the source of their distorted desires. Steins;Gate 0 If you weren't already in the know, Steins;Gate 0 is the anime adaptation of 5bp's incredible visual novel of the same name and the sequel to the much-loved Steins;Gate. It pretty much goes without saying that this is definitely a show to keep your eyes on. You can find the synopsis below: Eccentric mad scientist Okabe gives up his lively scientist life when he fails to rescue Kurisu. But when he is pulled back into the past, new tragedies are put in his path... GeGeGe no Kitaro The modern-day adaptation of one of Japan's most culturally influential series, there's a lot riding on just what this new GeGeGe no Kitaro adaptation does for the next generation. You can find the synopsis below: The existence of Yokai has been forgotten, until adults worldwide are plagued with unexplained chaos! And when Mana seeks help, there appears GeGeGe No Kitaro... With these new essentials hitting the streaming service, there's definitely a lot to look forward to as these shows begin the stream.

Firstly to get things started, if the name Dragon Quest Builders 2 wasn't enough of a mouthful to spit out while praising the game, you can now refer to it formally as Dragon Quest Builders 2: God of Destruction Malroth and the Empty Island if you want to be proper. Also showcased in the issue of Shonen Jump was the new character designs, which were of course handled by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump fame. Much like the Empty Island part of the name suggests, both the male and female protagonists find themselves lost on an island null of anything to do. This is where the "Builder" aspect of the game comes into play, with players tasked to explore and create to bring life back to the island. One of my favorite games in my recent library, Dragon Quest Builders originally released on PlayStation 4 in 2016 in Japan, and would later release again on Nintendo Switch in 2018. The sequel offers a number of improvements to the game including the ability to swim underwater, as well as a number of other changes to water physics and storyline. We'll be sure to keep you up to date as further information is announced.

13199|2018-04-02|19:00||http://otaquest.com/conbini-corner-lemon-slice/| News | N/A | Conbini Corner: Lemon Slices Serving You a Tangy, Chewy Boost | When it comes to these good citrus boys, there wasn't anything that could stop me from draining the vitamin c from them. |Japanese convenience stores no doubt offer a consistently interesting and ever-changing selection of snacks. Recently, a new, fresh looking bag of treats hit the shelves of Family Mart -- Sweet and Sour Dried Lemon Slices. Already having seen some buzz about them on Twitter, I felt compelled to make my way across the street to the local conbini and try them out. This sweet treat promises to deliver to you 547mg of Vitamin C, and with Tokyo being at the very tail end of the cold season, I was more than happy to go forth with munching on these revitalizing, tangy, dried slices. It’s too early in the year to enjoy a cold glass of lemonade, the pitcher still not collecting the condensation that the summertime heat offers -- but that won’t stop me from chowing down on some revitalizing citrus boys even at this time of the year. When I opened the bag and took a slice out, I was pleased with how visually appealing they were. The manufacturers didn’t skimp on quality and the slices are just the right thickness. The rind was a very satisfactory chewy texture, and that’s where most of the flavor and excitement was stored. In contrast, the middle part, the dried fruit flesh, was surprisingly papery. However, it’s worth mentioning that despite the contradicting texture, the papery part was also pleasingly sour, but not overbearingly so. The drying process took all of the uncomfortable sour bites out of the lemon and turned it into a casual snack that can be enjoyed during any part of your day for a zingy pick-me-up. I must mention that they were so yummy that I did end up eating the entire bag in one sitting, and it left a bit of an acidic feeling in my mouth for a little while. If you happen to find yourself in a Family Mart, definitely look for these Dried Lemon Slices, and enjoy them slowly!|Conbini, Conbini Corner
13198|2018-04-02|18:00||http://otaquest.com/trigger-gridman-pv/| News | N/A | Trigger’s ‘Gridman’ Project Previewed in New PV | Trigger’s collaborative project with legendary Ultraman producers Tsuburaya Productions, SSSS.GRIDMAN was previewed in its first PV today. |Trigger’s collaborative project with legendary Ultraman producers Tsuburaya Productions, SSSS.GRIDMAN was previewed in its first PV today. You can check it out below: Akira Amemiya (Inferno Cop, Ninja Slayer From Animation) will be directing the series based on characters from Tsuburaya’s original 1993 series Gridman the Hyper Agent but has stated that the project will be Trigger’s own, original take on the series and the tokusatsu genre as a whole. That sentiment is certainly clear in the trailer, as Trigger is bringing all of their hallmarks to Tsuburaya’s property. Everything from the color palette, character designs, and cinematography harken back to previous Trigger series such as Kill la Kill and Little Witch Academia. It’s clear that Trigger is working to create something that is their own, rather than a remake of the original Gridman series. The studio has also taken it upon themselves to update the setting from the 1990s to the present day, as is evidenced by the modern cars and smartphones seen in the PV. What’s more is that the tone seems far more somber than is typical of a normal tokusatsu series, which are usually made as light entertainment for children. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to hear any of the voice cast yet, who was revealed in an earlier announcement. They include Hikaru Midorikawa as Gridman and Yuya Hirose as Yuta Hibiki. Trigger’s collaboration with Tsuburaya stems from their work together on the 2015 Animator Expo short Gridman the Hyper Agent - Boys invent great hero. This too was based on the original 1993 series, which revolves around three kids making their own video game superhero, only to have it possessed by inter-dimensional police officer Gridman. The kids and Gridman then work together to fight against Dark Lord Kahn Digifer and his digital minions. As a whole, the original series does seem like a product of its time, taking advantage of the cultural shockwave that the rise of computers and information technology was behind in the 1990s, so I’m interested to see what Trigger can do to make the series relevant and entertaining once more.

13197|2018-04-02|16:00||http://otaquest.com/detective-conan-hunter-x-hunter-hiatus/| News | N/A | A Tale of Two Hiatuses: ‘Detective Conan’ and ‘Hunter x Hunter’ | Well, that didn't last long... Hunter x Hunter has been announced to be back on hiatus; parallel to this was an announcement that Detective Conan would be coming back soon. |As a fan of both Detective Conan and Hunter x Hunter, this week’s news regarding hiatuses for both series has revealed some real artistic differences between the legendary properties. In terms of Detective Conan, the sheer length of the series – around 900 episodes and 1000 chapters – has always seemed like more effort than worth to many people. I’m not up to date completely with the series yet, but I can safely say that the series warrants and owns this length, providing some great mysteries as well as excellent character work. Furthermore, the overall story of the series is much stronger than many seem to think, developing an intricate web of conspiracies which stalls Conan’s efforts to return to normal from his body of a child. Yet this longevity has taken its toll on aging author Gosho Aoyama, who took the series on hiatus last December to ‘recharge.’ Now, about four months later, Aoyama is ready to bring the series back to Weekly Shonen Sunday on April 11. The official Conan website shared some information about the latest arc, which will center around the showdown between Amuro Toru and Shuichi Akai. In addition, the first page of the new chapter was previewed: It doesn’t seem to be a coincidence that the 22nd movie in the franchise, Detective Conan: Zero’s Executioner, will open merely days later on April 13. Aoyama seems keen to continue the story in pace with the developments of the movie, which has been moving at a much faster pace recently in terms of advancing the overarching plot of uncovering the Black Organisation, who was responsible for shrinking Conan’s body in the first place. Compared to this, Hunter x Hunter’s announcement in the latest Jump that it would be going on hiatus once more “for a little while” rings much more hollow. Author Togashi only brought the series back in January after another extended hiatus for much of 2017. Even when the series was brought back to the pages of Weekly Shonen Jump, it hasn’t wowed fans in any sense of the word, with the story advancing incredibly slowly. This sense of ennui has been compounded by some very weak artistic direction, in which Togashi often fills entire panels with text, making it look dull and uninspired next to many other Jump series, which utilize some brilliant visual storytelling – One Piece being a key example of this. The difference in nature between the two hiatuses could not seem starker. Whereas Conan’s Aoyama seems to be working earnestly to please fans despite his health; Hunter x Hunter’s Togashi has not tried to make up for the time lost in his serialization because of his health, resulting in the current ‘Dark Continent’ arc not being as engaging as it should be. I mean, come on – a murder mystery with Nen powers, written by the mind behind the Chimera Ant arc? Everyone should be loving that, at least in concept. Yet, the environment of weekly serialization is a tough one. It’s easy to criticise authors like Togashi and Aoyama for their hiatuses from an outside perspective, but the reality of their work is much tougher than many of us realize. All we can do is to continue to support these authors at their best, and hope that they are willed on by fans to continue to put their heart and soul into their work. Detective Conan returns in Weekly Shonen Sunday on April 11. April 13 will also see the release of the franchise’s 22nd movie, Zero’s Executioner. Meanwhile, Hunter x Hunter will go on hiatus once more following this Monday’s issue (18). |Hunter x Hunter, Detective Conan

Inside their small shop in the center of ALTA’s 1st floor, you can find classic J± pieces such as their Angel and Devil dresses, Marine Cruise Sailor Uniform, and my favorite, an assortment of three different types of Pumpkin Shorts. そういえば本日は#天使の日！！ なので、天使の羽ワンピースをお勧めします！ ただ今悪魔の翼ワンピはセットプライス！双子コーデ(*-*) しかも在庫僅かなっておりますので、売り切れましたら終了になります。お早めにハロウィン仮装もお勧めです️ pic.twitter.com/23YGbXN3AY — J±池袋ALTA実店舗 (@Jplusminus) 4 October 2017 One of my favorite things about the brand is how their clothing designs appear to start as an anime-esque clothing design sketch, which they sometimes post on their Twitter as a teaser for a new release. They then turn the concept sketch into a delicate and sweet piece that you can pretty much don anywhere. J± is constantly releasing new pieces, and lucky for you, the staff is more than happy to let you use their try-on booth in the store. All of the J± clothing that I have tried on have been a very nice fit despite being the dreaded Japanese “one size”, and the material is of good quality and comfortable texture. Their outfits truly make for the perfect casual magical cartoon girl feeling. Interested in finding out more? You can find J± online via their official website, Twitter, Village Vanguard, or TheBase.

13195|2018-04-02|12:00||http://otaquest.com/april-fools-2018-roundup/| News | Anime | Looking Back on the Best April Fools From Japan in 2018 | We take a look back at the most outlandish April Fools jokes to come from the Japanese anime industry in the year 2018. |April is a special time in Japan – the sakura bloom, the sun comes out, and on the first, legions of fans are fooled by fake announcements in the spirit of April Fools’ Day. Below are some of our favorite April Fools pranks of this year’s festivities. It’d be safe to say that, following the end of Dragon Ball Super and the brilliantly animated PV for the upcoming movie, Dragon Ball fans are waiting with baited breath for news regarding the future of the series. Well, be careful what you wish for, as even Dragon Ball wasn’t safe this year from tomfoolery: 【奇跡の超コラボが実現】『映画ドラゴンボール超×映画プリキュアスーパースターズ THE MOVIE 孫悟空ＶＳキュアエール』が2019年4月1日公開決定！奇跡のスーパーパワーが激突！最強の“超”は、どっちだ！？https://t.co/N2QIwewFRO#ドラゴンボール超#映画プリキュア#エイプリルフール pic.twitter.com/EjkczECNiw — 「ドラゴンボール超」TV・映画公式 (@DB_super2015) 1 April 2018 With the tagline of “Which one is the strongest?!”, the Dragon Ball Super x Precure Superstars movie promises to explore the origins of the Saiyans, as well as usher in a return to Dragon Ball’s roots. That, or it’s a hilarious joke stemming from the fact that both series are owned by Toei Animation. Is this really what the newly formed Dragon Ball independent production department are spending their time on? Another crossover, if a less outlandish one, came in the form of the announcement of a Thunderbolt Fantasy x Touken Ranbu film: A collaboration between Gen Urobuchi’s puppet samurai drama and Nitroplus’ samurai bishonen mobile game wouldn’t be that mismatched if I’m honest. This one had me thoroughly fooled for longer than I’m comfortable to admit. Similarly, it took me a good while to work out that announcement of a Godzilla rollercoaster attached to the Marunouchi Building near Tokyo Station was also a joke. Check out the concept images below: 常盤橋開発の超極秘プロジェクト！ Ｇ（ゴジラ）棟の建設が決定。 2016年に凍結されたままのゴジラを東京駅前から移設し、 全く新しいオフィスビルが常盤橋に誕生します。#ゴジラ 詳しくはコチラ→https://t.co/BHvuegzN2b pic.twitter.com/oMxc8C0ZNp — ゴジラ (@godzilla_jp) 31 March 2018 Considering Godzilla’s status as a national icon – the kaiju even becoming an ambassador for tourism in the Shinjuku ward – it honestly wouldn’t surprise me if such an outlandish project did actually turn out to be true. But alas, it seems like we’ll have to make do with the light-up Godzilla head on top of Toho Cinemas Shinjuku for now. Moving over to the mobile game sphere, two titans of the genre weren’t exempt from some April Fools fun. Players of Love Live: School Idol Festival in Japan woke up on the 1st to a new gacha – hardly unusual – but this time featuring the child versions of both μ's and Aquors from Love Live! School Idol Project and Love Live! Sunshine!! respectively. また、小さくなったμ’s・Aqoursメンバーのサイドストーリーは、4月5日に追加予定となっております 小さくなったメンバーが登場するのは、 とくべつ！かんゆう・シールSHOPにて4月1日本日限定となります！ この機会をお見逃しなく 詳しくは⇒https://t.co/rfXWHWYcri#lovelive #スクフェス pic.twitter.com/1MJMEahzLX — 【公式】ラブライブ！スクフェス事務局 (@lovelive_SIF) 1 April 2018 This wasn’t just a joke either, as players who rolled on the gacha and received these new cards were actually able to use them in the game. Perhaps a new meta for the popular rhythm game will emerge from this? Only time can tell. Veteran and innovator of the genre The iDOLM@STER also had lots of goofs and gaffs to play in their numerous mobile games. The Kirarin Robo from the OVA shorts series The iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls Theatre finally made an appearance in the rhythm game Starlight Stage as the focus for the special one-day Kirarin Earth Defense Battalion event. Check out the hilariously over-the-top opening movie below: If you haven't seen the new opening for the Kirarin Robo app yet, here it is! Please enjoy the opening and all its loud sound effect splendor! pic.twitter.com/rXDGJKDlV1 — デレステENG (@deresute_eng) 1 April 2018 But if we’re talking over-the-top, then we really ought to talk about one of the latest additions to the iDOLM@STER mobile game empire – Million Live! Theatre Days. It too saw host to a one-day event Million Lie: Fishing Days where users had to, well, fish for some lost sheet music for a new song from various places, from the Arctic to space. Each stage also saw the story build in hilarity and ridiculousness, featuring various idols from the series. 今日は大変な一日になりそうです#ミリシタ pic.twitter.com/OrnrjRPn4G — ミリオンライブ！ シアターデイズ【公式】 (@imasml_theater) 31 March 2018 It wasn’t all fun and games though, as the event did see the long-awaited return of the original secretary Kotori Otonashi, who assisted the new secretary, Misaki Aoba, in retrieving the sheet music. That sheet music, in turn, added the song Machiuke Prince – one of my favorite songs from the original cast. These were only a couple of the goofs pulled in Japan this year, but these were some of the ones we enjoyed the most. It’s always nice to see the industry have a bit of fun every now and again, which makes me a little more forgiving of the more misleading goofs.|April Fools, Japan

The announcement was definitely very mysterious, being an English-language trailer aimed at North American audiences, yet also being uploaded to a Japanese YouTube channel... huh. Anyway, the first stop of the "Dragon Ball Tour" has been announced for San Diego, and will be taking place in July. We wrote at length the other day about Toei Animation's recent decision to open an all-new division exclusively focusing on the Dragon Ball property, so one could pretty easily piece this together as a result of that. Joining the North America Tour so far is Tamashii Nations, presumably where part of the "exclusive items" will be coming from. A Dragon Ball event, the greatest of all time, is coming to the United States and Canada. Consisting of 7 stops, starting from San Diego!! Expect exclusive items and a one-of-a-kind experiences! https://www.db-tour.com/ It'll be exciting to see just what comes of all of this, especially with Dragon Ball Super coming to a close recently. With the little information we have, we'll just have to wait and see what goes down in San Diego during the month of July. Further information can be found via the official website.|

Whether we devoted a portion of our lives towards making it, releasing it, writing about it, or simply listening to it, a lot of our free time is consumed by listening to music. There probably isn't a better place in the world to enjoy music either, with the majority of your day spent sitting on trains, you tend to hear an album or two every single day. I'm not going to be speaking for everyone on our staff here, rather, I'll be sharing just what I've had on repeat throughout the month of March. I can't really say I've stuck to any one genre this month, with each day almost demanding a different soundtrack due to the business of it all. Everything I'll be sharing today, however, will be from a Japanese artist -- or at least be an accurate representation of the sounds that are currently taking over the Japanese music scene.

These last few months have felt like such a good time for playful new music, and I'm always happy to have a platform to share all of it. I'd urge that if you enjoy any of the music, you dig further into the artist's archives and find some of the other greats of the genre.

We've spoken at large about Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom in the past, so this piece of news, in particular, came as quite a surprise to our entire team. Originally announced during the PlayStation Experience event back in December 2015, it wasn't for quite a period of time afterward that Japan would see their first trailer for the game. Turns out the reason for this was that developer Level-5 weren't even considering their home territory for its release. “At first, Ni no Kuni II was being developed for overseas, and there was a time where we hesitated on whether we should release a Japanese version." shared Akihiro Hino. "Ultimately we ended up making a Japanese version with high motivation,” he continued. It turns out the initial cause for doubt towards a domestic release was largely due to the accreditation and recognition the game received internationally. Presumably, this would mean that it was decided that focusing all efforts on international audiences would ensure for better reception outside of Japan, rather than gearing it towards Japanese audiences like the first game. "Entertainment is all about making things for those who say they really like something and give you money for it. The previous title received many awards overseas, and we decided to narrow down the target [for the overseas audience] and that’s why we made its title [Revenant Kingdom] romanized." Without a doubt, it definitely is a good thing that Ni no Kuni II saw a Japanese release; that being said, it'd be interesting to see reactions if they went through with their initial plan. Released March 23 on both PlayStation 4 and PC, you can find further information on the acclaimed JRPG title via the official website.

13179|2018-03-29|14:00||http://otaquest.com/weekly-shonen-magazine-morning-comp/| News | Manga | Two Manga World Giants Join Forces to Offer Serialization to Budding Mangaka | Two giants of the manga magazine world, Weekly Shonen Magazine and Weekly Morning, announced today their joint competition for budding mangakas. |Two giants of the manga magazine world, Weekly Shonen Magazine and Weekly Morning, announced today their joint competition for budding mangakas. With the tagline “Those who can’t draw can too become a mangaka!”, it offers a grand prize of both 200,000 yen (about $1,800 USD) and a serialization in either Magazine or Morning. The second and third prizes are nothing to be scoffed at either, offering 100,000 yen ($1,000 USD) and 50,000 yen ($500 USD) respectively. Competitions like this for newcomers are not uncommon in the manga world, but what makes this particular collaboration unique is that entrants do not need to draw a one-shot, as per normal. Instead, entrants only need to submit the title of their series; an outline of it within 140 words; a catchphrase to market the series if it begins serialization; the audience of the series; and the aim or message of the work. This is remarkably little information with which to submit a series for serialization, let alone submit a series for consideration by two of the biggest magazine in the business behind Weekly Shonen Jump. Weekly Shonen Magazine has been home to some of the most influential series in the history of manga, from Devilman and Cyborg 009 all the way to Ashita no Joe. Even now, it remains home to many legendary properties, including Diamond no Ace, Hajime no Ippo and The Seven Deadly Sins. On the flip side, Weekly Morning has played host to Naoki Urasawa’s Billy Bat, Vagabond, and the recent Giant Killing. Seeing these two titans collaborate to offer a chance to those who can't draw, enabling them to enter the manga world is a big chance for budding mangakas. As for the reason why they are collaborating, it is probably to do with the different audiences that the magazine each target - Morning aims for the ‘seinen’ demographic of 18-24, whereas Magazine enjoys wide support from the varied shonen demographic, although mainly from the upper echelon of 15-18-year-olds. With this, the scope of what type of series can be submitted is widened considerably. There is nothing stating that foreigners can’t enter the competition, so if you’re considering a career as a mangaka in Japan, this may be your big chance. You don’t have long to submit, however - entry closes March 30 - so check out the details here. The results of the competition will also be posted on their website on April 27. |Weekly Shonen Magazine, Weekly Morning, Devilman, Fairy Tail, Cyborg 009

The latest series from Eisner-nominated mangaka Inio Asano, perhaps best known internationally for his emotionally-driven works such as Oyasumi Punpun and Solaris, takes readers on a whirlwind journey through the minds of Kadode Koyama and her best friend. The series has been at the forefront of my attention for a period of time now, and I'm more than grateful I'll be able to pick up VIZ Media's release over here in Tokyo. Priced at $14.99 in the United States for the first volume, the series will also be available via the VIZ Manga App, as well as a number of digital marketplaces. VIZ Media has also shared that volumes will be released quarterly, with Amazon Japan currently listing Volume Two to release July 17 and Volume Three to release October 16. The series synopsis can be found below: In DEAD DEAD DEMON’S DEDEDEDE DESTRUCTION, the Japan Self Defense Forces are still looking for a way to combat the looming alien threat three years after the invasion, but so far conventional weapons have no effect on the mother ship. Maybe it’s time to try something unconventional. Meanwhile, Kadode Koyama is in high school. She and her best friend avidly track the aliens’ movements on social media and less enthusiastically study for college entrance exams. When the end of the world is overhead, you learn to take it one step at a time. It'd be an understatement to say that within the young adult manga world here in Japan, Inio Asano is one of the greats. His works have a surreal way of pulling you into this alternative reality, telling a story that seems painfully real despite everything going on in his pages. If you're yet to check out any of his other works, and simply can't wait for DEAD DEAD DEMON'S DEDEDEDE DESTRUCTION to release, I'd have to recommend Oyasumi Punpun which VIZ Media has also released internationally. If you're interested in digging further into Inio Asano's world, be sure to check out our full archive, here.

13170|2018-03-28|16:00||http://otaquest.com/aniplex-acquires-live2d/| News | N/A | Aniplex Acquires Live2D, Spells New Frontier for CG Anime | Aniplex has announced that they have acquired Tokyo-based software company Live2D offering a new frontier for CG in anime, as well as getting a strong-hold on the virtual YouTuber trend. |It was announced on Wednesday that production company Aniplex have acquired Live2D, who have been pushing the boundaries of animation in the mobile game sphere and beyond for years. Live2D’s two main products, Cubism and Euclid, help users to turn static drawings into animated models. This technology was used in JRPG title AKIBA’S BEAT to animate the game’s sprites, as well as in the program FaceRig, which has been used widely in the recent ‘Virtual YouTuber’ boom following the success of Kizuna AI. In the west, their technology is perhaps most prominently used in the Nintendo 3DS title Fire Emblem Fates. It’s no surprise, then, that Aniplex - one of the biggest production companies in Japan - would take an interest in acquiring this technology for themselves. The company is behind such series as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Sword Art Online as well as the recent DARLING in the FRANXX, along with countless others. By buying majority stock in Live2D, Aniplex now has another tool to offer companies when they are being considered as producers on a series. Additionally, the acquisition of such a technology by Aniplex may signal a new frontier for Japanese animation. 3DCG has often been criticised for it’s ‘jankiness’ compared to 2D animation by fans, and despite this, the usage of 3DCG in anime has been increasing; with even full CG projects such as GODZILLA: Planet of the Monsters appearing. That's not to say that 3DCG is inherently of a lower quality, something that was proven even through the aforementioned GODZILLA film, but there are a number of series that could use some work. Live2D combines both the art style of 2D animation along with the ease of use and versatility of a 3D model, and may, therefore, help to offset some of the perceived weaknesses of current 3D animation. The sheer scope of Aniplex’s business also means that we may be seeing this technology’s application sooner rather than later. No doubt there are countless Aniplex projects in the pipeline that the company could test this technology on, and in turn, the team at Live2D will have more chances to refine their product for anime, as it has mainly been used in games up until now. Upon acquiring the company, Aniplex stated that they will be using the technology for “feature films,” which shows that they already have an application for the technology in mind. No doubt, if this application is successful, then Aniplex will also consider it’s usage in TV anime. In any case, it remains to be seen what projects Aniplex will utilize their newfound acquisition for, but I hope that it helps further develop animation as a medium in a positive way. If it can help alleviate some of the gripes surrounding 3D animation as well, then all the better. You can find out more about the acquisition here (Japanese).|Aniplex, Live2D, Virtual YouTuber
13169|2018-03-28|14:00||http://otaquest.com/toei-animation-dragon-ball-independent/| News | Anime | Toei Animation Renews Focus on ‘Dragon Ball’ With New, Independent Department | Dragon Ball Super may have ended last week, but Toei Animation seems to have no intention of stopping with Dragon Ball content anytime soon. |Dragon Ball Super may have ended last week, but Toei Animation seems to have no intention of stopping with Dragon Ball content anytime soon. Toei Animation announced on Saturday a major restructuring of the company, with a new, third department alongside the two already existing departments that will solely focus on new Dragon Ball projects under development. The reasons cited for this are particularly interesting; firstly, Dragon Ball is apparently Toei’s “biggest property in terms of business,” which is definitely a revelation considering that Toei is also behind the One Piece anime, easily one of the most popular media franchises in Japan and the best-selling manga in the world by a long way (number two is Dragon Ball). Perhaps Toei is conscious of the massive overseas success of Dragon Ball, particularly with Dragon Ball Z in America and the recent advertising of the Dragon Ball Super finale on billboards in South America. In any case, the aim with this new department is to allow the series “independence” within Toei - allocating it with its own personnel and staff, which shows just how important Dragon Ball is to the company. This will perhaps allow future Dragon Ball projects to avoid the production issues of earlier Dragon Ball Super episodes, as well as avoid a considerable dip in quality during its run as has been the case with recent One Piece episodes. With this newfound “independence,” Toei also hopes that Dragon Ball can start to “proactively start business,” since it will have its own personnel with which to develop projects and partnerships. A key part of this will no doubt also be overseas development, which will finally allow Toei to properly take advantage of Dragon Ball’s popularity in the West. Perhaps we could see future Dragon Ball TV series and movies get wider releases and broadcast on prime time television? It’s certainly not a pipe dream at this point. All of this is a positive step towards ensuring that the future of Dragon Ball will be a good one. By having allocated personnel, those who are passionate about the series can better help shape new projects, as well as better represent the series with business partnerships. Furthermore, having writers and directors only work on the series will help them develop professionally and further offset the need for Akira Toriyama’s involvement, who is already sixty-two and has constantly expressed his lack of interest in developing future projects. At least in my eyes, more Dragon Ball content can only be good. Dragon Ball Super came to a close recently to rave reactions from fans, as it improved more and more over the course of it’s run. Dragon Ball FighterZ was one of the most well-received fighting games in years, already replacing Marvel vs. Capcom Infinity at Evo 2018. There are millions of fans of Dragon Ball just waiting for new content - both overseas and domestically. Here’s hoping that Toei’s new department can please them.|Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Toei Animation
13168|2018-03-28|12:00||http://otaquest.com/nagataro-san-tough-love/| News | Anime , Manga | Sate Your Appetite for Bullying After ‘Takagi-san’ With ‘Nagatoro-san’ | Feeling a little more comfortable in your own skin since the ending of 'Takagi-san' and its tough-love story? Well, maybe you should check out 'Nagatoro-san'. |With the Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san (Teasing Master Takagi-san) anime proving to find its own levels of success both in the West and domestically, it seems that the floodgate has opened up a whole new bullying-love comedy subgenre. The original Takagi-san anime aired last season, and was licensed by Crunchyroll. It revolves around middle school students Nishikata and Takagi, who you could consider to be seat neighbors. Takagi relentlessly teases Nishikata, and Nishikata in turns tries to get his revenge on Takagi, making for a heart-warming and hilarious love comedy. The manga, however, has been running for much longer – since 2012, it has been collated into eight volumes as of the time of writing. That makes ample time, therefore, for new series seemingly ‘inspired’ by Takagi-san to enter the scene - of which one of the best is Please don’t bully me, Nagatoro-san (Ijiranaide Nagatoro-san). Much like Takagi, Nagatoro teases and bullies our main character, Senpai, but at the same time tries to not let her affection for Senpai slip - making for some heartwarming and hilarious moments. The similarities between the two series are obvious, and it’s quite natural to consider them both in the same subgenre. In fact, the reason I became interested in Nagatoro-san in the first place was that I had already read Takagi-san, and was hungry for more. At least in concept, Nagatoro-san sates my thirst, but in actual fact, I appreciate them both for very different reasons, and I think you may too. Their approaches, for one, could not be more different - if Takagi can be called a ‘teaser’, then it’s safe to call Nagatoro a sadist. Whereas Takagi plays innocent pranks, Nagatoro gets her kicks from physically bullying the main character (simply named Senpai) – smacking him on the back, pushing him down, and generally exploiting our main character’s lack of physical strength. Add to this Nagatoro’s constant psychological tormenting of Senpai, teasing him for being a 'cherry boy' and an otaku, and it’s clear that Nagatoro-san has no intention of emulating the family-friendly tone of Takagi-san. This isn’t that surprising once you consider the widely divergent backgrounds of the authors. Whereas Takagi-san’s Souichirou Yamamoto has been drawing fairly light-hearted romance manga for most of his professional career – his other stand-out work being Fudatsuki no Kyouko-chan, a love comedy centered around a vampire and her brother – Nagatoro-san’s 774 or Nanashi has made a name for themselves drawing some very hardcore erotic doujinshi. In any case, 774’s career in doujinshi has probably made them privy to more adult things than Yamamoto, meaning that even a safe-for-work series from them would be infused with the adult tone that they have probably become used to in the doujinshi circuit. Moreover, one could argue that several dynamics to Nagatoro-san make it possibly stronger in the long run than Takagi-san from a reading perspective. Whereas Takagi-san’s Takagi and Nishikata stay mostly static over the course of the eight published volumes, Nagatoro-san’s characters have already seen some development that has piqued my interest as to where the series will go in the future. Senpai has started to stick up for himself more, and Nagatoro’s actions are more and more tell-tale of her love for Senpai. Compare this to Takagi-san’s formulaic-but-effective comedy, along with the foregone conclusion that Takeshita will end up marrying Takagi - as revealed by the sequel manga Karakai Jouzu no (Moto) Takagi-san (Skilled Teaser (Former) Takagi-san) - and it’s clear to see which one I’ll be excitedly anticipating future developments from in the future. To further counter those who would assume that Nagatoro-san copied or ripped off Takagi-san, it is important to realize that 774 had been developing the concept of their story and the characters of Nagatoro and Senpai for years – even releasing their own game based around these characters in 2016. There seems to be no evidence that 774 is a fan of Yamamoto’s work either, although I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case. If anything, it would be more accurate to assume that it was the publisher who was influenced by Takagi-san, as the serialization of Nagatoro-san came in the wake of the announcement that Takagi-san would be getting an anime adaptation. Therefore, even though the similarities between Takagi-san and Nagatoro-san are plenty, equally plenty are the differences between the two series. I, for one, am enjoying reading both series on their own merits. If you enjoyed Takagi-san, I think that it is likely you’ll enjoy Nagatoro-san, but at the same time, both series have their own distinct identities and appeal. Nagatoro-san has not yet been picked up for English localization, but considering the success of the Takagi-san anime last season and Yen Press’ licensing of the original manga last year, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was in the future. Volume one was released in Japan in March of this year. |Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san, Takagi-san, Nagatoro-san

Passionately crafted by the incredible team at Science SARU, Yuasa's own studio, the film has received numerous awards and critical acclaim for some blatantly obvious reasons. If you're yet to see it yet, let's kick things off with the trailer that GKIDS began streaming, found below: Perhaps best known for his high-energy works including Ping Pong and the recent Devilman CRYBABY anime series, Lu Over the Wall perfectly captures the spirit of Masaaki Yuasa's works and applies them to a powerful new story. Originally released May 2017 in Japan, my initial exposure to the film would actually be through a stumbled-across exhibit within the halls of Nakano Broadway, where I was drawn in largely due to the Yuasa association. For those unfamiliar with the film's story, you can find the official GKIDS synopsis below: From visionary anime auteur Masaaki Yuasa, comes a joyously hallucinogenic but family-friendly take on the classic fairy tale about a little mermaid who comes ashore to join a middle-school rock band and propel them to fame. Kai is talented but adrift, spending his days sulking in a small fishing village after his family moves from Tokyo. His only joy is uploading songs he writes to the internet. When his classmates invite him to play keyboard in their band, their practice sessions bring an unexpected guest: Lu, a young mermaid whose fins turn to feet when she hears the beats, and whose singing causes humans to compulsively dance - whether they want to or not. As Kai spends more time with Lu, he finds he is able to tell her what he is really thinking, and a bond begins to form. But since ancient times, the people in the village have believed that mermaids bring disaster and soon there is trouble between Lu and the townspeople, putting the town in grave danger. Winner of the Grand Prize at the prestigious Annecy Animation Festival, and premiering in English as an official selection of Sundance 2018, Lu over the wall is a toe-tapping, feel-good demonstration of Yuasa's genre-mixing mastery that will leave you humming long after you leave the theater. Set to begin airing across North America May 11, you can find further information via the official website.|Lu Over the Wall, Masaaki Yuasa, Gkids

We got our first taste of the game during JAEPO just a few months ago, and then again during AnimeJapan we were teased with its fast-paced gameplay and addictive gatcha system. It seems the powers that be know we're excited, and ahead of the game release, series creator TYPE-MOON has begun streaming yet another PV, which can be seen below: Within the PV's 1 minute 40 seconds runtime, we're tantalized with a wide-array of different servants that will be available in the game, likely upon release. Additionally, we're given a look at the game's theme song from ​Maaya Sakamoto which is titled "Kuuhaku" (Blank Space).

CRAZYBOY)" | Creative collective PKCZ® team up with hip-hop legend Snoop Dogg & producer Yultron for an epic new single, their first international release on Trap City. |PKCZ® has been making some serious waves since their inception in 2014. In only 3 years the multimedia creative collective has hosted live events at some of the largest venues in Japan, created a high design fashion brand, and kicked off a steady stream of original music and remixes working with some of the biggest names in the industry. Their debut full-length album “360° ChamberZ” dropped last summer in Japan featuring production by Afrojack & guest vocals from Method Man (Wu-Tang Clan) and several significant names from the LDH talent roster. Despite all of that they show no signs of slowing down with the supergroup featuring VERBAL (m-flo, Teriyaki Boyz), DJ MAKIDAI (EXILE), and DJ DARUMA (DEXPISTOLS) already making moves towards the US with their newest song: PKCZ® & Snoop Dogg & Yultron - “BOW DOWN (feat. CRAZYBOY)”. Released back on February 26th on US label Trap City (with support from Spinnin’ Records), this powerhouse track features production by Yultron with additional verses by EXILE TRIBE member CRAZYBOY and Long Beach native hip-hop legend Snoop Dogg. Frankly, for a group aiming to hit the ground running in the US there is basically no better way to do so than to collaborate with Tha Doggfather himself. “Bow down to the west, bow down to the east” Snoop opens the track in his signature style, informing listeners that he and his collaborators are not to be trifled with. The beats feel reminiscent of a classic martial arts movie soundtrack as CRAZYBOY steps in with a verse exclaiming love for his home in Tokyo, while still demonstrating that he can flex with the best of them. Next VERBAL slides in dropping his trademark flow with further assertions that they aren’t messing around, and switching it up between English and Japanese in his signature manner that we’ve all grown to love. The track doesn’t give you time to breathe or react while listening, with the lighting quick progression demonstrating the strengths of everyone featured. During our recent interview about m-flo’s upcoming EP we took the opportunity to ask VERBAL about the process of working with Snoop and how this whole collaboration came together: "So last year we came out with 360° ChamberZ, our first album which was focused on the Japanese market, but when we started PKCZ® the idea was of a project or creative get together of people who all want to do something interesting. Like Tomato from England, Underworld, different architects and graphic designers, people who want to collaborate and help each other. It’s not even a company, it’s a collective of creative minds doing different types of projects. That was the idea behind it, we wanted to do things on a worldwide scale. When working on the first song after the album we were discussing who we should ask to feature, throwing all sorts of different names out there. Someone had mentioned “How about Snoop?” and I was like “YEAH.” Everyone went through Snoop, everyone loves Snoop. I mean who doesn’t, you know? He rings, or resonates to every country, every race, so we decided to take a stab at it and see if he was down. Kev from Far East Movement used to be under the same management company, so he helped us reach out. We already had the track ready with Yultron, so we threw the whole idea to Snoop’s Camp and then lo & behold they came back with Snoop’s vocals, and he’s shouting us out. Then me & Elly got in the studio and laid the rap down, the rest is history." Then there’s the music video, which is a perfect representation of the “east meets west” vibe of the track. Verbal offered some insight into that process for us as well: "Snoop’s camp said “We’ll do the video on one condition, that you shoot at our studio.” and I’m like “Yeah, umm of course.” *laughs* Who would say no to that? So the video is like a kung-fu theme, another condition was that we bring a kung-fu master to teach Snoop the moves at the shoot. So when we got to the studio he was so into it. We were only supposed to have an hour, but he kept going for like 3 hours. That was a really awesome experience." We're excited to see where PKCZ® goes next with their journey into the US market. There has been a ton of really amazing music coming out of Japan for years, and recent trends in America have shown that language isn't as much of a barrier for foreign musicians as it used to be. Bias aside, we're looking forward to the days when more Japanese artists begin to push toward the US further and PKCZ® could be just the group to start that movement. PKCZ® & Snoop Dogg & Yultron - “BOW DOWN (feat. CRAZYBOY)" is available now on iTunes and Spotify.|PKCZ, Snoop Dogg, Yultron, Crazyboy, exile tribe, bow down, verbal

Because I'm sure not. The worlds of Pop Team Epic and Batman Ninja clash once more to promote the upcoming Warner Bros Japan anime film. |Are you upset? Because we sure aren't. Warner Bros. Japan has just uploaded a new CM for the upcoming Batman Ninja anime film ahead of its June 15 release featuring Pop Team Epic's own Popuko and Pipimi. The CM is a callback to the classic "Are you upset? I'm not upset." skit from both the original manga and anime adaptation of Pop Team Epic, featuring Popuko as the Dark Knight and Pipimi as Joker. Trying to figure out just how this would look? Well, check out the video below: Yeah, that was definitely something. Wondering how this came to be a thing that's actually happening? Well, you might recall the Pop Team Epic anime was in part animated by the team at Kamikaze Douga, well they also happen to be the same people handling the Batman Ninja film that's coming out on June 15 in Japan. It'd be pretty reasonable to assume that, with the adequate permissions from King Records and Warner Bros. Japan, all they had to do was re-texture their 3D models and boom -- we're left with... this. It's definitely worth noting as well that during Warner Japan's stage show at AnimeJapan, they went on to share that there will also be Nendoroid made for the Pop Team Epic x Batman Ninja characters.

13148|2018-03-26|12:00||http://otaquest.com/anime-japan-food-review/| News | Anime | AnimeJapan - A Deliciously Serious (?) Food Review | Beyond the panels, stalls, and cosplay of AnimeJapan 2018 lay another, mysterious frontier that writers Mike and Jacob set out to discover -- anime food. | Beyond the panels, the stalls, and the cosplay of AnimeJapan 2018, there existed another mysterious frontier that writers Mike and Jacob set out to discover. That frontier was the collaboration food menu, of which they were able to try five of six (the last one was miso ramen from sword boy series Touken Ranbu). Below is a short review of the food itself, with which they hope to tantalize our reader’s taste buds and inspire their imaginations. Editors Note: The two writers in question are nefarious for having poor, uneducated opinions on food; this is especially showcased by their unfortunate favoring of GoGo Curry over the superior CoCo Ichibanya Curry. Take everything said below with a grain of salt. NEETball Curry Rice (Osomatsu-san) Let's open this with a question; how many Matsuno brothers does it take to make a single curry rice? Surely it had to be the combined efforts of all six, especially given the surprising taste offered here. I’m pleased to offer props to whoever served this classic Japanese curry rice dish with a pleasant helping of cheese to boot. Upon opening the lid, just a bit of steam rose to flow through my nostrils. It wasn’t overly-hot in actual temperature, but the sauce itself pleasantly-surprised with a bit of a kick. If you’ve ever had a savory Japanese curry before, there really isn’t too much else to write home about, but man, the combination of a meaty roux and a rather unorthodox topping was delightful in a familiar, comfortable sort of way. I can’t help but wonder though; if these NEETballs were just a little more active and had some sort of stable job, would they have been a lot more tender and juicy? Gin-san’s Bokutou Churros (Gintama) Wielding this mighty churro in my hand made me feel powerful; well, at least to the extent that either a wooden “bokken” sword or a chocolate and cinnamon-covered churro could actually make me feel. Wrapped in a delightful paper sleeve resembling Gintoki’s iconic outfit, I knew that I was about to slice any lingering pangs of hunger in two. Out of my selections, this was the easiest to award a near-flawless enjoyment score to, because it seems really hard to mess up a churro. If we replaced all weapons with the likes of these, I imagine that we’d attain world peace real quick. Jack & Rockets Cheeseburger “Hellsalem’s Lot Special” (Kekkai Sensen) I must profess that I haven’t watched or read Kekkai Sensen yet, but the thought of a good cheeseburger was too powerful for me to resist. I’m sure that a lot of the references contained within the dish were therefore wasted on me, but I can definitely comment on the quality of the food. What I first noticed was that the cheeseburger was only lukewarm, which immediately put me off once I picked it up. I have a real disdain for lukewarm dishes and have sent back food many times in restaurants because of this, so this was initially affronted. I’m happy to report, however, that the quality of what was sandwiched between those buns was very pleasing. Two slices of firm cheese paired well with the soft texture of the patty, which initially panicked me as I wondered what meat it might be made out of, but it soon won me over. Another boon to the appeal of this burger was the subtle-yet-effective relish spread on the lower bun, which again added another dimension to the patty. Overall, I would definitely take up another opportunity to taste the Hellsalem’s Lot Special burger once more, and perhaps next time I’ll actually be able to understand the references. (Jacob Parker-Dalton) Rabbit House’s Sandwich (Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?) Sandwiches tend to be a classic choice because they can be quite effectively filling. If you’re crafty enough, you can even include all of the essential food groups into the meal -- heaps of vegetables and proteins snugly fit between to slices of processed carbs. I’m sad to report that the Rabbit House’s Sandwiches achieved none of the goals a typical sandwich can hit and that it was easily the most disappointing thing between both mine and Jacob’s dishes. Maybe it was simply missing a chaser in the form of some lovely coffee brewed at the hands of some impossibly-cute anime waitresses, but if this was the only thing I would have ordered, I would probably be able to fill a mug with my own tears. Appearances can be deceiving -- it may look like these sandwich slices are of typical width and height, but each slice of bread was honestly no larger than that of my index finger. Coupled with some paltry slices of ham and cheese, a meager amount of potato salad, and a barely-there presence of ketchup and omelet, and the only redeeming quality to this dish being the cute strawberry wrapping paper. Kirei Kotomine’s Mapo Tofu-don (Fate/stay night: Heaven’s feel) Mapo tofu is one of my favorite dishes in the world, and so even though I’ve fallen out of love with the Fate series as of recently, I couldn’t help but enjoy this. Tofu can be a hard nut to crack, as you have to take care in ensuring that the tofu isn’t too hard or too soft. Ideally, it should melt in the mouth and provide only a slight hint of its existence within the dish. In turn, I’m happy to say that the collaboration mapo tofu-don was able to achieve this. Pair this ideal consistency with a spicy-yet-tasty sauce that pairs brilliantly with the tofu, and you’re on to a winner. Further adding to the experience was that the dish is based on one of my favorite moments in the Fate series - Kirei’s encounter with Shirou whilst eating incredibly spicy mapo tofu in Heaven’s feel. To further get in the Fate collaboration mood, for those who wanted to emulate Kirei’s profuse sweating during that encounter, an extra sachet of spice was also provided. But, the dish was spicy enough for a mapo tofu lover like me without adding that extra spice. I’d be happy to eat Kirei’s tofu once more, anytime.

13140|2018-03-25|18:00||http://otaquest.com/persona-5-the-animation-new-trailer/| News | Anime | AnimeJapan - 'Persona 5 the Animation' Reveals New Trailer, Departures from Game | A star-studded cast took to the stage at AnimeJapan today to discuss the upcoming Persona 5 the Animation, as well as how it will differ from the original game. |A star-studded cast took to the stage at AnimeJapan today to discuss the upcoming Persona 5 the Animation, as well as how it will differ from the original game that released on PlayStation 3 & 4 in 2016. Although many of the supporting characters will remain mostly the same, it is Jun Fukuyama’s Ren Amamiya (the Protagonist) that will see the most variation from the source material. This makes sense of course, as in the 2016 game, Fukuyama’s character was silent and intended to be a surrogate character for the audience to project onto. Turning Amamiya into a living, breathing character independent of the audience will naturally necessitate some changes. In order to avoid spoiling the developments of the anime for the audience, Fukuyama was remarkably tight-lipped about what these differences will precisely be. But one interesting slip-up was that in terms of romance, Amamiya will not focus on just one girl, but will instead engage in multiple encounters with different girls, like a “game of catch.” This seems to suggest that, during the course of the anime, Amamiya will fall in and out of favor with different girls, and may not necessarily settle for one girl in the end. Such unknown developments will be key to sustaining the audience’s interest, many of whom will have already played the game. After this initial talk, Fukuyama then commented on the fact that the cast hasn’t all been together like this before, and was happy that they were all able to appear together. After all, Fukuyama himself, as well as Yusuke’s Mamoru Miyano, Futaba’s Aoi Yuuki and Yusuke’s Tomokazu Sugita are all A-list voice actors, meaning that finding gaps in their schedules at the same time must be very tough indeed. What’s more is that they haven’t had the opportunity to see each other in the studio yet, since recording for characters that will appear later in the story such as Futaba and Haru (Haruka Tomatsu) hasn’t actually started yet. To the delight of the audience, a new PV was also shown. Although some of the animations still look a little underdeveloped and off-model, it does seem that the team at A-1 Pictures are working hard to capture the mood of the original game in anime form. Following the new PV, it was announced that the first six minutes of the first episode will be previewed on the Persona 5 radio show on March 28, which isn’t too far away. New goods were also announced, which the multitude of ita-bag holding fans I saw on the way out will surely be ecstatic about. Overall, it seems that production on Persona 5 the Animation is progressing smoothly. Both cast and crew are thinking carefully about how best to deviate from the story for the anime adaptation, particularly with regards to Amamiya. What remains to be seen is if this anime adaptation can go beyond the quality of the game, and became an enthralling experience in its own right.|Persona, Persona 5, Persona 5 the Animation, AnimeJapan
13137|2018-03-25|17:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/anime-japan-kimikoe-project/| News | Anime | AnimeJapan - 'Kimikoe Project' Foster the Next Generation of Anime VA Talent | Through auditions and closely-mentored training, Tohokushinsha is seeking out and fostering the next generation of talent. We went to listen to their first successful candidates. |The fandom surrounding our favorite voice actors within the world of both anime and games is as strong as ever, with the dream of many an anime fan being to someday join the world of their favorite professionals. Individual voice actors can become very popular, and their fans will usually follow them to the ends of the earth -- whether that means that they will automatically watch an anime because their favorite voice talent has landed a role, or if they are out to catch a musical performance. The spheres of both professional voice acting and musical performance can cross over quite often, with the two talents being much sought after by anime producers. As with any talent-based roles, however, it eventually comes time for the current generation to pass the torch on, and that's where Tohokushinsha's 'Kimikoe Project' comes in. The initiative, which can be translated as the 'Your Voice' Project, aims to allow people from any and all walks of life to audition in the field of professional anime voice acting, receive training and mentorship, and hopefully eventually go on to become mainstays in the minds of fans the world over. First held for women in 2016, the group of six successful candidates have gone on to form a unit known as 'NOW ON AIR,' and made their debut in last year's anime film by Studio Madhouse Kimi no Koe wo Todoketai. With some experience under their belts, they were joined onstage by veteran Kenji Tsuda at this year's AnimeJapan to discuss their experiences with the Kimikoe Project, what they have learned so far, and what is next for Tohokushinsha's ambitious program. ＼盛況にて終了！／「キミコエ・プロジェクト スペシャルステージ」は盛況にて終了いたしました！ご来場の皆様、ありがとうございました！津田さんが見届け人を務める「第2回 キミコエ・オーディション」、今後の発表にぜひご注目ください！#animejapan #キミコエ pic.twitter.com/aTyalXvCyb — キミコエ・プロジェクト (@kimikoe_info) March 25, 2018 From left to right: Momone Iwabuchi, Misako Ino, Mina Katahira, Kenji Tsuda, Mitsuho Kanbe, Hitomi Suzuki, and Aki Tanaka. During the intense process headed up by anime director Naoyuki Itou of Overlord fame, Tanaka mentioned that the girls started to see each other less as rivals, and more as buddies or comrades in the process of becoming the kind of person they all admired. Tsuda, who you may know as the iconic voice behind such characters as Yu-Gi-Oh!'s Seto Kaiba and Damien Baldur Flugel from this season's Violet Evergarden, gave words of encouragement to the girls, and even answered some of their pressing questions live on-stage. One that especially stood out to me was his likening of a seiyuu to painters -- they all use the same kind of tool, the brush. How one chooses to wield their brush, or their voice in the case of a voice actor, is entirely up to the individual. Once the skills are firmly in place, each individual artist is able to forge their own, unique style. The big news to come out of the event though was that 'Kimikoe' is ready to move on to the next step and that the auditions do not end here. Debuting over the course of this year, the company has announced that the next leg of the project is open to men. The core tenets of the 'Kimikoe' Project remain the same: You will debut in a brand-new anime work You will be contracted with a voice acting agency You will receive free support and mentorship from Tohokushinsha There are no restrictions placed on entrants, but being that the project is targeted at voice actors operating within the Japanese market, be prepared to speak plenty of Japanese, and do so with that necessary professional flair! If you are interested in more details surrounding the next set of auditions, then I advise you to keep your eye on the official site here.

13139|2018-03-25|16:00||http://otaquest.com/anime-japan-my-hero-academia-movie-s3/| News | Anime | AnimeJapan - ‘My Hero Academia’ Cast Talk ‘Going Beyond’ in New Movie, Third Season | As the smash hit My Hero Academia heads into its third season, voice actors for both heroes and villains alike took to the stage today at AnimeJapan to talk the new series. |As the smash hit My Hero Academia heads into its third season, voice actors for both heroes and villains alike took to the stage today at AnimeJapan to talk about the new series today. Opening the show was a rousing performance from character Deku, All Might, Bakugo and Uraraka, who appeared on stage in outlandish mascot character form. These same costumes had been seen on the event floor previously in front of the Toho Animation booth, though they still managed to catch us off-guard. Daiki Yamashita (Midoriya Izuku), Nobuhiko Okamoto (Bakugo Katsuki), Ayane Sakura (Ochaka Uraraka) were present on stage, with Kaito Ishikawa (Tenya Iida) taking charge of the proceedings – very much in line with his class representative character in the show. Then – to the heroes’ surprise – the League of Villains stormed the stage, with Kouki Uchiyama (Tomura Shigaraki), Misato Fukuen (Himiko Toga), and Hiro Shimono (Debi) arriving to crash the party. "Villains will be what makes this third season so unique," said Uchiyama. Up until this point, they had not yet appeared as the fully consolidated League of Villains, which only formed at the end of the series' second season. "Adding villains to the mix will make for a vastly different experience," the voice actors affirmed. In performing the roles of the villains, the voice actors were also confronted with several problems. When Uchiyama first saw the Tomura’s design – covered in hands – he was at first shocked, and then struggled to gauge what emotion he should be expressing, since Tomura’s expression is always hidden. In the same vein, Toga’s voice actor struggled at first to be menacing in her performances, which is not surprising given her previous work in the relatively cutesy Rosario + Vampire and Sailor Moon Crystal. Furthermore, Shimono had to work hard in lowering the volume of his voice to become more menacing, since he is usually portrayed as a louder individual. This certainly came across during the event as well; whenever he talked he would stand up and make his way to the front of the stage, while the other voice actors remained calmly seated. Once Yamashita and Okamoto pointed this out, it also became a running joke and brought great amusement to both the audience and cast members alike. Not only will the villains constitute new horizons for the series, but the cast also promised that we will also see new sides to the students themselves. Yamashita pointed out that, in the previous series, the teachers were always able to save the students, but hinted that this time the students will be on their own. Although it’ll be sad to see the potential absence of such great characters as Aizawa and All Might, it is reassuring to see that both the cast and production team are working hard to keep the series fresh and moving in new directions. What will make this new series even fresher, the cast added, is the rising tensions that will take place during the events of Season Three. They observed that, with each series, the stakes have been raised higher and higher, and that won't be changing this time either, in order to "go beyond." The fact that the villains will appear and that the students won’t be helped by the teachers will likely only add to this. Finally, the discussion moved towards the movie, which will release on August 3 and is titled My Hero Academia: The Two Heroes. A new key visual was released, showcasing the title and release date, but also a striking image of the main cast – Deku, Bakugo, Todoroki, Uraraka, and Iida – as well as an interesting tagline in “Who is your hero.” Further intriguing is the image of what seems to be a young All Might within the tagline, suggesting that the film will delve into his backstory before he became a teacher at UA. What’s more is that the cast revealed that the series will take place “overseas” and feature the students and All Might operating during a “huge catastrophe” in order to save a new character. Many questions still remain as to the nature of the film, but this visual does intrigue me as an My Hero Academia fan. Set to release August 3, 2018, in Japan, there's definitely a lot to get excited about.

Previously made available in the West through its anime adaptation that released in 2012, it's exciting to see the story in its full finally set to be available. Perhaps one of my highest regarded visual novel series of all time, Steins;Gate would become a name I'd be repeating time and time again. For both its incredible world building ability, as well as its gorgeous visuals and storytelling, Steins;Gate had me completely won over, and I can't wait to experience that magic again with the release of Robotics;Notes. Though it's currently unknown on which platforms we'll be seeing the visual novel released, one can only hope it makes its way to both PC and Switch, as well as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

13134|2018-03-25|12:00||http://otaquest.com/anime-japan-lupin-the-third-director-com/| News | Anime | AnimeJapan - ‘Lupin III: Part V’ Director and Voice Actor on Lupin’s Past, Present and Future | Director Yuuichirou Yano and voice actor Kenjiro Tsuda took to the TMS Entertainment stage today at AnimeJapan to share some details about the hotly anticipated Lupin III: Part V. |With the April 4 airing date drawing ever closer, director Yuuichirou Yano and voice actor Kenjiro Tsuda (Albert Dandorojii) took to the TMS Entertainment booth’s stage today at Anime Japan to share some details about the hotly anticipated Lupin the Third: Part 5. With an attitude of pride and honor to their voice, both professed that they were “raised on Lupin.” Director Yano in particular stressed how careful he was in trying to develop a story that would be in line with Monkey Punch’s original series, and is in constant communication with the author. Tsuda also expressed his uneasiness in meeting Daisuke Jigen’s voice actor, Kiyoshi Kobayashi, as he is the only remaining original voice actor for the main cast. However, he was pleased to find that, as they worked together, they grew closer and are now good friends. Seeing such a bridge between new and old Lupin certainly filled my heart with joy. Director Yano then moved the conversation towards addressing the nearly thirty-year gap between Lupin the Third: Part III, and the 2015 series Lupin III: L’avventura Italiana (Part 4). Even though many people in the industry adored Lupin and would have loved to have created a new series sooner, it took a long time for L’avventura to be approved by the studio. Moreover, what was interesting was that even though Yano expressed how “tough” this was, he seemed determined to continue with more Lupin projects in the future to make up for it. He even referred to the 2015 series as a “resurrection”, which seems to suggest that Lupin isn’t done quite yet. After finishing up production on the 2015 Lupin, Yano said that he wondered where to take the series next. Eventually, he decided on France, since it fit well with Lupin as a character. After all, the thief’s name was taken from Arsene Lupin, a fictional famous French master thief. Moving the series to France felt like a return to Lupin’s “roots”, Yano remarked. Obviously, it was only after careful consultation with Monkey Punch that Yano decided on this, but I think a trip to France does indeed fit well with Lupin’s character. Along with a change in setting, several new characters have been introduced to the series for Part 5. Once more, these were created in cooperation with Monkey Punch to ensure that they honored the spirit of Lupin and fit in with the series as a whole. Tsuda offered some details on his character, Albert, describing him as “cool but cold,” with an emphasis on the “cool.” With a smile, he also ensured the audience that there are many mysteries to uncover about this new character, which he hopes fans will look forward to uncovering. Hacker girl Ami Enan was also discussed, with Yano describing her as “different from a normal heroine” and as the story’s “key”. It seems, therefore, that the story will revolve much more around the development of these new characters rather than the main cast themselves, in the same vein as Rebecca and Nyx of L’avventura. Developing new characters alongside our old, favorite characters will be one key to keeping the Lupin series fresh and original in today’s modern anime landscape. Yano seems aware of this fact and ensured the audience once more that Part V was simply “one step” in the evolution of Lupin, and hopes that he can create many more Lupin series to come. Since we have continued to see Lupin productions even after L’avventura, with the release of both the Italian Game special and the movie The Blood Spray of Ishikawa Goemon, it certainly does seem that the Lupin franchise has no plans to stop once more anytime soon. In the meantime, I’ll be looking forward to Part 5 and seeing if it can live up to the quality of L’avventura. The new series airs April 4, with further information available in our full archive.|Lupin the Third, Lupin III, Lupin the IIIrd, Lupin the Third Part 5, Lupin III: Part 5, Yuuichirou Yano, AnimeJapan, Anime Japan, Lupin

It's an agreeable standpoint, especially with the painful humidity of summer in Japan basically stripping you of your will to do anything. Originally teased just a couple of months ago via a slew of previews and tweets, Snail's House's latest endeavor "Snö" is finally here. Let's take a deep-dive into its gorgeous wintertime bliss below: With winter drifting off behind us as we enter the more colorful season of spring, Snail's House sends the snow-filled winter off with a final hoorah. Perhaps more than anything,"Snö" feels to be the embodiment of Snail's House dynamic production skill set. It's a down-tempo album with the uplifting sounds that the name Snail's House has become so synonymous with, bringing in a wide array of influences to craft what truly does feel like nostalgia for a season that just departed. Through its 10 song tracklist there is an entire thematic story to be told; every song feeling like words taken out of your own mouth, words described without language, nothing but rhythm and sound. Tracklist: 1. Snö (intro) 01:13 2. [covered in white] 04:43 3. [snowdrift] 04:51 4. [fluttering] 04:16 5. thaw (interlude) 01:58 6. [whiteout] 04:04 7.

13111|2018-03-22|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/sweets-paradise-pop-team-epic/| News | Anime | Photo Report: Checking Sweets Paradise's Bitter-Sweet 'Pop Team Epic' Collab | 'Sweets Paradise' is already the best of Japanese all-you-can-eat, but the addition of 'Pop Team Epic' undeniably makes it even better. |In a bid to promote Bkub Okawa's monolith Pop Team Epic series, the kuso manga-gone-anime has teamed up with Japan's iconic sugar-sweet Sweets Paradise buffet chain offering a limited number of exclusive meals and goods. For many, the concept of an "all-you-can-eat" buffet takes on a bit of a different form depending on where you hail from. In Japan, the most common way to gorge yourself is through the "tabehoudai" and "nomihoudai" systems, which can be translated as "eat as much as you like" and "drink as much as you like" respectively. The affairs are usually timed, with common ranges being two to three hours at the upper limit. You can find "houdais" for a great variety of foods, from "yakiniku" grilled meats to pizza and tasty bar foods. Enter Sweets Paradise -- a Japanese chain at the forefront of "sweets tabehoudai," which I am convinced that is a concept that only exists on a widely-accepted level in Japan. Imagine it, and let your tastebuds weep: 90 minutes of unlimited cakes, pastries, and fried snacks. Add on plates of pasta and loads of tasty sauces, curry rice, and even a sizable salad bar, and you have an all-you-can eat-experience that is hard to top. Imagine our excitement then, when a chain normally associated with good feelings and happy times announced a collaboration with our favorite irreverent manga-turned-anime series, Pop Team Epic. A few special collaboration dishes and drinks are available for an additional charge on top of the normal 90-minute cost, and we were able to sample most everything available. Let's take a look at what we got! Most of the items come with colorized panels of the original 4-Koma in wafer form. We don't have sake, so we'll suck this lemon! This may get you kicked out of a lot of other places. The kuso green pasta was a lot more appetizing than it may seem. Of course, it wouldn't be a proper collaboration event without some tasteful decor. After enjoying the collaboration menu, grab a plate and enjoy the traditional Sweets Paradise experience to your heart's content. As we left the fine establishment, we were gifted with some truly useful items -- two New Year's 2019 postcards well ahead of time. I bet you didn't know that next year was the Year of the Boar until now, too. You'll be able to find the Pop Team Epic x Sweets Paradise collab at a few locations across Japan. Check out the list below, and get ready for a truly kuso eating experience.

13122|2018-03-22|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/comix-wave-haoliners-shikioriori-trailer/| News | Anime | CoMix Wave & Haoliners Share First Trailer For Upcoming Film Shikioriori | CoMix Wave and Haoliners' upcoming anime film anthology Shikioriori has received its first trailer ahead of their Summer debut. |Haoliners have been gradually proliferating themselves into the Japanese anime industry for years now, but their latest collaboration with CoMix Wave Films (Your name., 5 Centimetres per Second) could be the next big break for the Chinese animation company. The collaboration, named Shikioriori, is a series of three shorts based around the themes of food, clothing and shelter. Each story will take place in a different Chinese city and will be helmed by different directors. Several animators from the studio are making their directorial debuts on the project, which will hopefully usher in a new generation of young international directors for the years to come. In the anime industry, it’s safe to say that China is a massively important market. It is second to only the US in terms of licensing deals with Japan, and the fact that many anime are also broadcast on satellite TV means that the type of series that are licensed can be done so with an eye for recurrent broadcasting, making long-running shows such as the 900-episode long Detective Conan more viable. Haoliners’ new collaboration with CoMix Wave Films could spell a deeper relationship between the two companies – a relationship highly sought after by many companies after the success of Your name. and the work of Makoto Shinkai in general not just in Japan, but around the globe. Haoliners’ previous stand-out work for me personally, To Be Hero, was a bombastic OVA series that aired in 2016. It centered around a toilet seat designer, who once sucked into a toilet, became a superhero. The series paired its wacky premise with equally over-the-top visuals, showcased some seriously excellent abstract animation talent that helped elevate the comedy of the series. Yet, these new CoMix shorts seem to shy away from this style, option for more or less of a replica of Shinkai’s realistic, hyper-detailed animation style. While this style does have its benefits, and there are many who enjoy the presentation of his movies, for me, this realistic presentation limits the expressiveness that animation can bring to a story. Such expressiveness can only be found in animation since everything is drawn and can be manipulated to express even the wildest of imaginations. I worry that, by trying to emulate Shinkai’s style, the up-and-coming animation studio will lose the charm and expressiveness it has previously displayed. It would be a shame for them to abandon this style of presentation, given that it worked so well in To Be Hero. Even so, this collaboration represents an important linking between the Chinese and Japanese animation industries. These shorts will also be getting a theatrical release in Japan, which will not only put Haoliners’ name on the map but also provide some much-needed representation of China in animated media. Further information on the anthology can be found via the official website, here. (Source: Anime News Network)|Shikioriori, Comix Wave, Haoliners

When it comes to this image, it wasn't just your average joke post shared in our chat, but rather, an actual informative piece of imagery detailing the results of a 1,300 person survey posing the question "What is your favorite type of cup ramen?". The survey was conducted amongst groups 20 years and above, with the answers clocking in with a somewhat surprising leader. The survey pooled together a wide-variety of instant ramens that you'd most commonly find at both the convenience store and supermarket allowing the general public to vote on their favorite. If you couldn't tell already, first place was claimed by Cup Noodle Seafood with a total of 263 votes, while regular Cup Noodle came in at 262 votes. That's a total difference of one vote. That being said, it goes without saying that this was a print mistake as Cup Noodle Curry rightfully should have been first place, and Shin Ramen shouldn't have been too far behind. The full top five can be found below: 1. Cup Noodle Seafood - 263 Votes 2. Cup Noodle - 262 Votes 3. Cup Noodle Curry - 168 Votes 4. Chicken Ramen Donburi - 90 Votes 5. Cup Noodle Chilli Tomato - 81 Votes Additionally included in the survey was a breakdown of those who shared their answers, with the majority percentage being 30-year-old males at a total of 18%. Closely behind was 20-year-old males with 17% input, while 20-year-old women made for roughly 15% of all votes. This breakdown can be seen in full below: 20 Year Old Male: 17% Female: 15% 30 Year Old Male: 18% Female: 14% 40 Year Old Male: 16% Female: 10% 50 Year Old Male: 6% Female: 3% Other 1% Where do you fall on the instant ramen debate?

Touted as the first scale figure for the self-proclaimed Virtual YouTuber, we find Japan-based company Stronger Co., Ltd. handling production. Additionally, Tokyo Otaku Mode has made specific note that the figure is under close inspection from Kizuna AI herself, supposedly ensuring that the device meets her always high standards. Let's take a look at the figure then, shall we? It goes without saying, but if the actual end product comes out as good as these previews are looking, fans are in for a treat with this one. From the coloring to the sculpt, you can basically hear "HAI DOMO!" being screamed in the distance. Those of you unfamiliar with Stronger, Co., Ltd. can find comfort in knowing they were the team behind the gorgeously put together Hanairogoromo Miku which has easily become one of the most sought-after Hatsune Miku figures in recent memory. As of right now the price for the Kizuna AI figure is unknown, though it's expected to be announced when pre-orders go live.

The trailer debuted during a mobile game presentation livestream earlier this week where it was confirmed that the film is tentatively being called Dragon Ball Super, and will be the 20th film entry into the Dragon Ball universe. The new trailer can be seen below: Coming soon, a new adventure to be the strongest begins. The new #DragonBallSuper movie teaser is here! ️ pic.twitter.com/DO8SidUfPz — Toei Animation (@ToeiAnimation) 20 March 2018 Running for just over 30 seconds in duration, the English subtitled trailer features both Goku as well as a new villain who appears to have the powers of a Saiyan. There was no additional information revealed about the character during the livestream other than that "might be" for the villains Saiyan status. The movie features an original story, as well as screenplay, by series creator Akira Toriyama. This serves to further showcase his heavy involvement in the animated series as he steps further away from his work as a mangaka. Akira Toriyama had previously made comment about the film, which can be found below: This Dragon Ball Super film is the next story after the currently airing television anime. The story takes place after the climax of the Tournament of Power, where the fate of the universe was at stake, and the short rest that follows. It will give a few previously unwritten details about the Saiyans and Frieza, as well as a long-awaited strong opponent to overcome, and I think it will be an enjoyable story!From 2013's Battle of Gods and the last film Resurrection 'F' to the current film, I've been carefully writing, and I've had the pleasure of drawing lots of designs and the like. I'm actually as busy as ever, but while I don't have to serialize anything I have time to think about the anime, which used to be out of my hands. (laughs) So please look forward to it! By the way, the television anime is over for now, but Toyotarō's popular manga (five volumes out now!) is continuing. I think it will have different developments from the television anime and film, so please look forward to it. I certainly will!

13113|2018-03-21|14:00||http://otaquest.com/conbini-review-gari-gari-furufuru-tsu/| News | N/A | Conbini Corner: Gari-Gari's Limited-Time 7-Eleven Collaboration Taste Test | We tried out 7-Eleven's collaborative Gari-Gari flavor Furufurufurufurufuru-tsu in all of its sugar-sweet glory. |Chances are you’ve seen the iconic blue tinge of Japan’s darling Summertime popsicle Gari-Gari once or twice in a few of your favorite anime. Its sugar-sweet taste has almost become synonymous with Japan’s sweltering heat, bridging the gap between children and adults alike. One thing you probably don’t see, however, is that there’s actually a large number of unique and exciting flavors that fill the conbini freezers season around, and it's not just limited to popsicles. In celebration of the 20,000th 7-Eleven location to open up in Japan, the iconic convenience store chain has partnered up with a large-number of snack creators, Gari-Gari included, to create a number of limited-time goods and confectionary. Dubbed the “Furufurufurufurufuru-tsu” flavoring, it’s a 7 flavor popsicle with an 11% fruit to other things ratio. Talk about staying on brand. I’m a sucker for Gari-Gari myself, and there was no way I was going to pass up on the opportunity to try this bad boy, despite the sudden snowstorm that took place in Tokyo today. Upon immediate inspection, the packaging is wrapped in the iconic 7-Eleven colors and features the popsicles mascot character Gari Gari-kun in that same uniform we all see day in, day out. Opening the package emits the ambiguous scent of sticky-sweet gummy worms. The outer shell has an apparent tangy muscat flavor, whereas the softer pink center seems to be holding the rest of the fruits hostage. The center has a bit more of a mild taste than the outside, and the flavor of the muscat takes over more than anything else. With that being said, you can just nibble the center and imagine its any one of the seven fruits it promises to be. Overall, I’d say that the artificially flavored monstrosity that is the “Furufurufurufurufuru-tsu” does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do. Offering a solid taste and a weirdly nostalgic sensation, I’m all for it, and can only hope this new flavor sticks around until Summertime actually returns.|Gari-Gari, Furufurufurufurufuru-tsu, Conbini Snacks

Calling on a heavy EDM influence, a trend that's been sweeping Japan over the last few years, the trio have been reshaping their sound alongside producer Yasutaka Nakata. Acting as the theme song for Chihayafuru Part 3 which hit cinemas across Japan on March 17, 2018, the music video was originally previewed in a shortened clip uploaded just 3 weeks ago. This isn't the first time the trio has worked with the Chihayafuru property, having originally performed the theme song "FLASH" for the first film back in 2016. This is especially worth mentioning with Perfume's latest single, which went on sale March 14, containing both "Mugen Mirai" and "FLASH," as well as an instrumental version of "Mugen Mirai." Additionally, there's an alternative version of the record going on sale which will contain Perfume's collaborative song with NTT Docomo, "FUSION." The single oozes with the blended sounds of both the underground and overground music scenes, with hard-hitting electronic sounds pulsing throughout as Perfume layers their iconic harmonious vocals above. It's an interesting step for the group, one which continues to hint at the future of the trio as today marks the 16th anniversary since their first single release with "Omajinai Perori." |Perfume, Mugen Mirai, Perfume 2018, Perfume Mugen Mirai, Perfume Music Video, Yasutaka Nakata

13105|2018-03-20|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/thibault-tresca-pop-team-epic-interview/| News | Anime | [Interview] Sitting Down With Pop Team Epic's Thibault Tresca | We sat down to chat with Pop Team Epic's darling French star Thibault Tresca as he tells us everything he knows (and doesn't know) about his work on the series. |Bonjour, je m'appelle Lachlan Johnston et aujourd'hui dans cet épisode de Japon Mignon, nous bavarderons avec le fastueux Thibault Tresca, animateur de Pop Team Epic. Ahem... We here at OTAQUEST recently had the incredible opportunity to sit down and chat with multi-talented creator and animator Thibault Tresca regarding his life before Pop Team Epic, the events that would lead to him landing the job of a lifetime, and his advice towards any other aspiring creators. You may know him best for his hilarious Japon Mignon segments contained within the Pop Team Epic anime series, all which kick off with that iconic "What the hell is going on?" French introduction and lack of initial subtitles. For Thibault Tresca, landing the role with Kamikaze Douga was equal parts hard work and sheer luck. Having already interned in Japan prior to his work with the studio, nothing could have prepared the creative for what was coming when he began work on the Pop Team Epic series. But I'll let you hear it from his mouth, not mine. Sitting down in a quaint French restaurant in the distant corners of Nakano, we shared a few words with the French creative. From the beginnings up until now, let's talk the life of Thibault Tresca: Hey Thibault, it's a pleasure to be here with you today. The earliest Japan-based video on your YouTube channel dates back about 3 years ago and it follows your adventures traveling around the country as well as your experiences. Can you tell us a little bit about what led to you making that? When I arrived in Japan for the first time it was for an internship, I’d been wanting to come to Japan so bad before that and I felt like that was the right moment. The internship was at a small studio in Harajuku where I did simple 3D animations; the guy that owned it was actually French as well, his wife was the Japanese one. It ended up lasting about two months, and I really enjoyed it so I set my eyes on coming back. I ended up doing another internship in Sydney, Australia before the opportunity to come back to Tokyo would arise again, where I ended up making my way to SIGGRAPH Asia to volunteer. I was filming videos the whole time, I really wanted to embody all the different things I was seeing. When talking about both filmmaking and 3D animation as mediums that you partake in, do you often find any overlapping traits between the two that assist in the process? The satisfaction I get from animation, as compared to filmmaking, is quite different. I feel as though animation is a more long-term creation process, seeing every frame side by side as you work. I like filming and editing because it’s almost like instant gratification, as opposed to needing to create everything one piece at a time. The two feel quite different to me at the very least. Can you tell us a little bit about how you would eventually go on to work with Kamikaze Douga? Back in 2015, I traveled to SIGGRAPH Asia as I mentioned, and when you’re a volunteer you get a few extra perks. You get the opportunity to have your portfolio reviewed by real professionals, who funnily enough are often volunteers themselves, and they’ll give you a few pointers on how you can better your work for the industry. While I was waiting my turn for reviewing, my friend came up to me and said that there was a Japanese company here who, if I was interested, would be happy to look over my work. Though he said if I wanted to just keep waiting that’d be fine too. I thought to myself, well, “Hell yeah,” and went ahead with it. That company was Kamikaze Douga, and when I approached them expecting to get the feedback, they instead asked if I was interested in moving to Tokyo to work for them. Unfortunately, I still had a year left to my studies so I told them “Let’s keep in touch!” and sent them a mail 6 months after that. They remembered my work and liked it enough that they asked to do a Skype interview where they hired me on the spot. Once I graduated I moved to Tokyo to meet them, did the visa stuff and the rest is history. When talking about Kamikaze Douga, what was your first real project with them? My first project with them was actually Pop Team Epic. And were you familiar with the property at the time? Absolutely not. (Laughs) Basically, when I arrived they asked me if I wanted to do ‘this’ or ‘this,’ I can’t remember what the other one was, but Pop Team Epic really appealed to me because of the characters. But when saying you can take ‘this’ or Pop Team Epic, he actually gave me two middle fingers; not knowing anything about the series, I thought this was something along the lines of “You can do this or you can get the hell out of our offices” (laughs) I was nervously sweating a storm because I didn’t speak a word of Japanese back then, but obviously that was cleared up pretty quickly though. (Laughs) When I ended up choosing Pop Team Epic to work on, they specifically asked me not to look too much into it. They didn’t want me to try and copy what already existed in the manga, so it was kind of an “Eh, read the manga but don’t look too much into it. We kinda want to have you… untouched. Do your own thing and we’ll validate whatever it is” situation. This probably overlaps with another of your questions, but the interview segment at the start of my scenes ties in similarly. I had no idea that so many people were excited about the series, so when my boss came up to me and said “Let’s put this interview before you scene,” I kind of was like “Ehh, that’s weird. My scene is so short I don’t really feel like my scenes need any explanation” but I went through with it anyway even though it was painfully awkward. What I didn’t understand though was that it was all part of the joke, just throwing me into the middle of the episode speaking French as kind of a “What the hell” moment for audiences. I honestly thought the clips were for the website as part of a creator discussion thing, and I had no clue they were going to include it in the show. Then all of a sudden when the first episode aired my phone was blowing up with messages like “Dude what’s going on? You're on TV, that’s so cool!” and suddenly I was filled with the sense of “Oh no, what have I done.” (Laughs) (Laughs) So you had no idea it was going to be on TV at all? Not at all, the segments in the TV show where I’m being interviewed were all pre-filmed too, so in every single segment, I was completely unaware that my face would be broadcasted. I guess this was all part of their plan though, having me untouched by the series. I actually ended up becoming a really big fan of it too; so now I wish I could go back in time and change up so many of my scenes. In retrospective though, I guess that’s what they really wanted from me. I wish I could have known just how wild I could have gone. If you could go back in time, is there anything you’d have told yourself to change up in your segments? Hmm, I didn’t have enough time to really come up with the story ideas. I had about one week to come up with something really funny, so I kind of just worked with what I could come within that timeframe. I’d probably make things a little edgier, probably quite a bit. One thing I didn’t know leading into the project because I couldn’t explore the source material was that, in my scenes, the characters of Popuko and Pipimi were very… cutesy? I sort of missed the point there because of the lack of knowledge, but again I guess that was what they wanted. So when you were creating the segments they didn’t give you any kind of feedback or direction? Were they just kind of like “Do what you want to do with it”? Yeah, absolutely. So the thing was, that was good, it’s nice to have free power over your creations. But that being said I was often like “Can you please give me some sort of direction” and they’d just say “No, just do your thing” and I was pretty much left in the dark. It was very much a “Don’t look at what others are doing, we don’t want that imitated” kind of scenario. The first time I handed in a draft to my boss I kind of tried to mimic the manga a little bit which was a mistake. They were kind of like “No, no, no, don’t do that. Do your own stuff, your own backgrounds, etc.” so I went back to it. So your introduction to this series was through the middle fingers from your own boss; you obviously knew this wasn’t going to be a traditional show. What was it that drove you to present the narcissism of France through your segment? They actually asked me to. It wasn’t so much “It has to be about France” because I’m sure if I was Australian they’d say do something about Australia, but that was the only instruction I got. They also said don’t be afraid to be coarse in your humor, do some crazy stuff. Given I’m French, I feel like I kind of have a free pass to make fun of my own people. That being said, because it was going to actually be televised I didn’t want to smack talk France too much. On top of that, I didn’t know my face was going to be before it, so I’m pretty glad I didn’t go too overboard or else my face would be public enemy number one. That’s kind of why the story that I present is always kind of double-edged. There’s this thing called “Paris Syndrome” which is basically where people from Asian countries will travel to Paris expecting it to be this beautiful fantasy land, only for it to completely shatter their dreams. That was kind of the main inspiration for it all. Can you tell us a little bit about the idea of creative freedom in Pop Team Epic? Was it more like “Oh, I’ve been left in the dark” or an actual sense of “I can do whatever I want in my segment”? At first, it was kind of like being in the dark, there were a bunch of moments where I was just thinking to myself that I really wish I had some sort of guideline. Every time I’d hand something in they’d just be like “Okay, thank you” and it was like “No, tell me if it’s good or bad. Please.” (Laughs) That being said, I was happy I had the freedom to do all my backgrounds and designs. When I started working at the studio, they were actually using this software I’d never used before. So I kind of had to learn while making the episodes, I felt like the software was so stiff compared to what I’m used to. I’ve gotten much better with it now, and I’m actually looking back thinking about how the animation would be so much better if I had a little time to learn. Do you feel like the creative freedom was beneficial in regards to how to work with a Japanese studio when creating a show? I think I was very lucky with this project as to just how much freedom I was given, usually, people would have to stick to very tight guidelines and make animations just like everyone else on the team. It didn’t ever feel like I was working for a Japanese company, it was very… free. I guess like, looking online there’s chatter that they should make every show like this, just letting people do whatever they want and let their imagination run free. Do you agree with that statement? Yeah, I think like, I didn’t know how the episode would be broadcasted. But now that I see how everyone’s scenes kind of tie-in, I can kind of feel bad about my scene. (Laughs) Like, for example, Bob Epic Team, is absolutely brilliant. The creators went all out wild on that, and I wish I did my scene more like that. (Laughs) I think the idea of freedom in itself makes for a unique end product. That being said, Pop Team Epic absolutely did not prepare me for my next project. It totally inflated the idea that “Oh, I’m an artist, I do whatever I want” then as soon as I began on the next thing that idea was out the window. (Laughs) It’s very easy to miss that freedom. When talking about 3DCG in the animation industry, especially with Kamikaze Douga’s influence through the likes of Pop Team Epic and the upcoming Batman Ninja film, what kind of changes do you think we’ll be seeing in the future? Well, I think 3DCG has already largely taken over the animation world. When you’re talking about Disney, everything is 3D now. That being said, I don’t think 2D animation will disappear anytime soon, and I’d actually suggest 3D will take 2D to new places. People like 2D way too much for it to ever disappear. What I like about Kamikaze Douga is, for example, when looking at Batman Ninja, that whole film is cell shaded to give off a 2D effect. I like that they’re trying to find the middle ground between both 3D and 2D animation. Simply due to the efficiency of 3D, I’d say we’ll be seeing more and more of it in the future, but 2D will always have its home. Over the last decade, there’s been a number of prominent foreign creators popping up in the Japanese anime industry. How do you think it compares being a foreigner in the industry as opposed to being from Japan? I think it’s definitely well known that the way in which they animate over here is much different when compared to the West. It’s a very unique and recognizable style when compared to anything else. When working on Pop Team Epic, it was definitely a case of “Do your foreigner thing” as opposed to “Do what we do,” so I guess that was something different. There’s definitely an advantage to bringing in a Japanese person over a foreigner simply due to the fact that you don’t need to teach someone something if it’s all they know, as opposed to a foreigner who has to adapt. With that being said, I wouldn’t say I quite have the experience to speak for the people on this one. That being said, the added value of having a foreigner on your staff is the fact that they can bring that something different to the series, which is exactly what they asked me to do at Kamikaze Douga. When I was asked to do things like them, however, it did feel like I needed to have someone hold my hand the whole way. We’re entering a time where more and more foreigners are looking to break into the Japanese anime industry; what would you suggest to anyone hoping to get their start? The most important thing is learning Japanese, though that much is kind of obvious. When I arrived I didn’t know anything, but now I’m getting better step by step. Almost nobody speaks English at my company, meaning during meetings and such I’m left to decipher what was said and if it was to do with me. Don’t be afraid to speak to your boss if you ever feel uncomfortable. This was something that I had never been very good at, but these people are your friends and almost family. If you don’t ask about things, nothing can change in your favor. When I first started at Kamikaze Douga, I only had one monitor on my desk while everyone else had two. I’d always worked with at least two monitors, so it was a little off-putting. I actually had it in my head that the second monitor was like a right of passage thing, and that after a month or so I’d get one. Well, eventually I just asked my boss and he gave me one on the spot. (Laughs) Specifically when working in Japan, be aware of payment culture. For example, I didn’t know that it was commonplace over here to pay for the second month when you start working and that payments are for that previous time period. I ended up blowing through my budget my first month living here, and then when what I thought to be payday came and nothing was in my account, I very quickly learned that I’d be using all my savings. (Laughs) Obviously read over the contract properly, and ensure what you’re signing is offered in your native language. I’ve been relatively lucky in all my years traveling around the globe, but this can be a big one anywhere. Well, that answers all our questions for today. Thank you so much for your time, is there anything you want to say to your international fans? Thank you so much for supporting my work, and please enjoy Pop Team Epic!

His first work, Planetes, is beloved by many for its gripping depiction of a future in which some of the lowest-paid members of a huge corporation are charged with cleaning up space junk. The anime adaptation of the same name saw some wild success among the sphere of hardcore sci-fi anime fans. It's time to add the other Yukimura classic to the (likely) annals of time as Vinland Saga is finally getting the anime adaptation it deserves, by Studio WIT no less! Relative newcomers on the block, Studio WIT have handled Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, and most recently The Ancient Magus' Bride. Check out the announcement trailer below. In the announcement over on Comic Natalie, author Makoto Yukimura offered a lengthy comment, which I've translated below. Hi, I'm Makoto Yukimura, the original author of 'Vinland Saga.' When I first heard the news about the anime adaptation from my editor-in-chief over at 'Monthly Afternoon,' I was frankly, quite worried about his health. "What is it?" I had asked, and when I heard that it was to be produced by the big talent over at WIT, I was blown away. How did they manage that? The very same WIT that produced 'Attack on Titan' and 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress'... banzai! I'm not worried about a thing. The most I can do is really just stay out of the staff's hair. In fact, I really just want to enjoy the 'Vinland Saga' as a regular audience member, and not from any sort of higher position. Everyone, sit back with me and prepare to be blown away by this godly anime. I'm so looking forward to it! So there you have it. That's as good as validation as any I suppose! If you haven't checked out Vinland Saga as of yet, do be sure to check out the official manga release overseas by Kodansha Comics, and check out their synopsis below. From the acclaimed author of Planetes. Winner of the Japan Media Arts Awards Grand Prize for Manga and the Kodansha Manga Awards. As a child, Thorfinn sat at the feet of the great Leif Ericson and thrilled to wild tales of a land far to the west. But his youthful fantasies were shattered by a mercenary raid. Raised by the Vikings who murdered his family, Thorfinn became a terrifying warrior, forever seeking to kill the band’s leader, Askeladd, and avenge his father. Sustaining Throfinn through his ordeal are his pride in his family and his dreams of a fertile westward land, a land without war or slavery … the land Leif called Vinland.

Announced today with the launch of an official website, the upcoming film calls on the talents of original series director Kenji Kodama, as well as the screenplay talents of Yoichi Kato. Perhaps most importantly, however, was the inclusion of TM Network's iconic "Get Wild" which acted as the original theme song for the series in the trailer. Aniplex upload region restricted to Japan Re-upload by pKjd Tsukasa Hojo's original 193 chapter manga series began publication via Weekly Shonen Jump in February 1985 and remains an important cultural icon to date. It's exciting to see such an important series being revisited, and perhaps even more exciting is the calling on of the original director to handle it. You can find the series synopsis below: Ryo Saeba is a "sweeper" in the city of Tokyo. His works as a trouble shooter, cleaning the streets of vermin, and helping out desperate people. Sometimes he's a bodyguard, sometimes he's an assassin, whatever Ryo does he does it well. In fact his only flaw is his hormones - he loves the ladies and sometimes turns into an idiot when he's near them. Thankfully he's got people like his partner Kaori Makimura to keep him in check. Additionally, the voice acting roles of both Ryou Saeba and Kaori Makimura were announced. Voicing Ryou will be Akira Kamiya, the original voice of the character in the 1987 anime series. Voicing Kaori will be Kazue Ikura, the original voice actress behind the character. This really is shaping up to be something incredible.

Adding to this, they further went on to assure that the series would be receiving a sequel, reiterating that there's another 'episode' in the works. The first entry into the film series is titled Made in Abyss: Tabidachi no Yoake (Made in Abyss: Journey's Dawn), with the second film being titled Made in Abyss: Horo Suru Tasogare (Made in Abyss: Wandering Twilight). Production of the series' second season is currently underway. Based on Akihito Tsukushi's 2012 manga series of the same name, Made in Abyss wowed viewers around the world when it premiered in Japan during July 2017. The series would eventually go on to begin streaming on Amazon's much despised Anime Strike streaming service, where it would eventually go on to receive the award of Crunchyroll's "Anime of the Year" during their annual awards show. These days the series can simply be streamed via Amazon Prime Video without the need for an additional service. The series synopsis can be found below: The Abyss—a gaping chasm stretching down into the depths of the earth, filled with mysterious creatures and relics from a time long past. How did it come to be? What lies at the bottom? Countless brave individuals, known as Divers, have sought to solve these mysteries of the Abyss, fearlessly descending into its darkest realms. The best and bravest of the Divers, the White Whistles, are hailed as legends by those who remain on the surface. Riko, daughter of the missing White Whistle Lyza the Annihilator, aspires to become like her mother and explore the furthest reaches of the Abyss. However, just a novice Red Whistle herself, she is only permitted to roam its most upper layer. Even so, Riko has a chance encounter with a mysterious robot with the appearance of an ordinary young boy. She comes to name him Reg, and he has no recollection of the events preceding his discovery. Certain that the technology to create Reg must come from deep within the Abyss, the two decide to venture forth into the chasm to recover his memories and see the bottom of the great pit with their own eyes. However, they know not of the harsh reality that is the true existence of the Abyss.

13094|2018-03-19|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/dr-stone-preview-piece/| News | Manga | Shonen Jump's Manga Series 'Dr. STONE' is a Masterpiece in the Making | When Dr. STONE originally began in March 2017, I don't think anyone could have predicted just how great it would eventually become. |When Dr. STONE began in March of last year, I don’t think anyone expected it ever become as good as it has. I mean sure, author Riichiro Inagaki had already written the successful American football manga Eyeshield 21, but the difference in concept between it and Dr. STONE – between sports and fantasy – could not be more apparent. If Inagaki was only adept at writing sports manga, then we as readers we probably going to be in for a bad ride. Artist Boichi also had experience in writing and drawing many other series in various other magazines, but for all his prolificity, he hadn’t had a ground-breaking hit, anything that would make him a household name – at least not yet. In its current form, Inagaki and Boichi’s co-creation Dr. STONE has the potential to become an incredibly strong series, if not one of Jump’s best. As of the time of writing, four volumes of the manga have been released and it has currently been in serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump for over a year. The story follows genius teenage scientist Senku, who is going about his business normally one day, until a catastrophe occurs, turning all of humanity into stone. Fast forward several millennia and Senku is finally able to break free of his stone body and move once more. The only problem is that nature has once more reclaimed the Earth, erasing any trace of the twenty-first century and throwing humanity back one more to the Stone Age. But Senku with his head filled with all of the scientific knowledge of the modern era refuses to accept this, setting out to rebuild modern society once more. This bizarre premise is what originally drew me into checking out the story when it first started, and I’m sure that this was the case for many others. As crazy as the story may seem, it is merely the first sign of how inventive and imaginative the authors of this story are. Although the series does play along with many of the shonen genre’s tropes, it does so with an imagination and furious creative spirit that is rarely seen in the genre. Despite overflowing with creativity, the authors have somehow managed to keep themselves in check and maintain good pacing – most likely due to their combined experience. The first arc is fairly uneventful, but this slow pacing allows for the reader to get a better grasp on the characters – a wise choice by the authors if they wish to continue this serialization for many years to come. Even so, the story moves along when it needs to, particularly in the second arc, where the authors avoid getting bogged down in the busywork of the characters in order to keep the tension high and the story developing. As the story now moves into a seemingly broader in scope, more battle-focused arc, I hope the authors continue to keep up this excellent pacing, which makes the story an absolute joy to read. Not shying away from their bizarre premise either, the authors have somehow managed to make it work, turning it into something truly compelling. The premise that every human on Earth is trapped in stone gives rise to an interesting question; whether all humanity should be liberated once more, or whether we should take this opportunity to right the wrongs of humanity in the past. The series’ main antagonist, Tsukasa, argues that only the strong should be revived, as humanity has no need for the weak in the Stone Age. However morally comprehensible that may be, it certainly is an interesting conundrum that makes up the moral core of the series. Furthermore, the science aspect of the series, embodied by our main character Senku, is executed so well that I’m honestly baffled as to how this type of story hasn’t been done before. Using his knowledge of twenty-first-century science, Senku overcomes the obstacles in his way. First, to counter Tsukasa’s raw strength, he uses the tools available to him in the stone world to create a gun. Then, once he arrives in the village, he sets about making an antibiotic to cure the village maiden. Each step in the process is explained clearly and simply, meaning that I now know (in theory) how to make an antibiotic from scratch, using only the simple tools of the Stone Age. The authors have only managed to make this work because of their evident passion for science, which allows them to present the scientific process in interesting and engaging ways, but also because author Inagaki’s writing, in general, is excellent. The slow evolution and improvement of the series over time is yet another testament to Inagaki’s skill. At the beginning, the scope of the series was small, allowing us to form connections with our main characters and establish the ideological conflict between our protagonists and antagonists. The second arc saw the series expand in scope slightly, introducing a village of characters, as well as a slightly loftier goal of creating an antibiotic. Moving into the third and current arc, the scope has enlarged further, but such a jump isn’t detrimental to the story because it has been constructed in such a controlled way. Planning, as well as how to construct stories in a way that takes advantage of the long-form, serialized format, is something an author can only learn through experience – a skill Inagaki has clearly picked up from his time on Eyeshield 21. It’s not right that we give Inagaki all the credit, however, because Boichi’s art is also integral to the quality of the series. His paneling is consistently good, allowing the reader to easily follow the action. Although his art is more realistic than fantastical, with lots of clean lines and detail, his character designs are still very unique and always interesting – take Senku’s unusual hairstyle, for one. This means that, even in a hectic action scene, each character is immediately recognizable because of their character design. Additionally, since the writing and artwork have been split between two, I trust that we won’t have to accept a loss in quality on the art side in order to keep the story afloat either, an unfortunately common issue in Jump manga. Furthermore, Boichi marries Inagaki’s apparent passion for science with his own as he presents Senku’s discoveries in engaging, interesting ways – my favorite so far being the way he portrayed poison gas as an attractive woman, who then turns into a monstrous mound of rotting flesh, reflecting the deadly nature of sulfur dioxide. With all this praise, however, it would be inaccurate of me to omit the glaring flaw of the series so far, which is clearly the first arc. Initially, the focus of the story is on brawn-over-brains Taiju, whose character is as stereotypical as it is grating. In addition, some have complained about the slow pacing of the first arc, which I don’t view as a problem but may put some off from reading the rest of the series. Furthermore, several events at the beginning of the story weren’t handled as well as they could’ve been, particularly the ‘death’ of a certain character. That being said, the later developments of the story far outweigh the early downsides of the first arc, developments which I can also forgive as the duo were finding their feet both in the magazine but also in cooperating with each other. Overall, Dr. STONE is one of my favorite series in Jump right now. I’m always excited to see where the story goes next, and it has consistently entertained me ever since I decided to pick it up all the way back in March of last year. As the series moves forward, into larger horizons, I have no doubt that it will continue to grow in quality and – hopefully – popularity. You can find out more about Dr. STONE here (Japanese).

Calling on the same staff that made the first season so incredible, we see director Yuzuru Tachikawa and character designer Yoshimichi Kameda making a triumphant return. Additionally, we'll see Hiroshi Seko returning to BONES for series composition on the second season. Originally launched in 2012 by One-Punch Man creator ONE via Ura Sunday, the manga series would eventually conclude two years later in 2014. It was in 2016 that the series was adapted for anime by BONES, premiering in Japan during July and simulcasted globally by Crunchyroll. Six months later an English-language dub was made available by the team at Funimation, with their synopsis of the series available below: Kageyama Shigeo (a.k.a. Mob) is an 8th grader with powerful psychic abilities. Workingunder his not-so-capable master, Reigen, Mob uses his powers to exorcise evil spirits. But his will to be normal causes him to suppress his powers and feelings until he hits 100 percent — a point where his pent-up emotions are unleased and a darker power takes over. With no extra information outside of the returning staff and green-lit status, we'll just have to wait and see as to when it'll actually premiere in Japan. Until then, we'll be sure to keep you updated with further information as it's announced. If you're yet to see the incredible first season of Mob Psycho 100, you can watch it online via Crunchyroll.|Mob Psycho 100, Mob Psycho 100 s2, Mob Psycho, Mob Psycho 100 Season 2, Yuzuru Tachikawa, Bones

We look back at everything we've achieved here at OTAQUEST over the past 12 months, as well as where we want to continue moving forward into the future. |It's honestly pretty crazy to think about, but OTAQUEST, the passion project-turned-reality for so many of us out here in Japan, has finally reached a year old. Sitting in front of the computer or being out at events, it's not often I'm given the opportunity to reflect on everything we've achieved thus far, but it really has been a wild ride from the very start. So today I'll be doing exactly that, reflecting upon the year that was leading up to this very moment with OTAQUEST. As many of you may know, OTAQUEST came to life by the hands of both Taku Takahashi and Dai Sato, but the concept of what we do actually came about a little before the two of them even sat together and decided to make this a reality. It would be during a round-trip tour of the United States that Taku would realize during discussions with our now-director Eddie Lehecka that the United States is, in many ways, painfully behind on the trends of Japanese pop culture outside of anime. Building upon that, it was realized that there was an extreme disconnect between anime creators and their fans, something we felt needed to be addressed due to the growing medium globally. |

After a second film would go on to be crowdfunded entirely by fans across the globe, and a massively-successful anime series would be produced in 2017, it was finally teased that Little Witch Academia would be receiving its own video game on both PlayStation 4 and Steam. Well, you're not going to need to wait much longer to get your hands on the game, with Bandai Namco Entertainment announcing audiences in the United States and Europe would be able to begin playing the game from May 15. In celebration of this announcement, Bandai Namco Entertainment began streaming the game's opening movie: Having launched in the latter half of 2017 in Japan, it's exciting to see that English-speaking audiences will finally be able to have their hand at the game. Described as a "3D Action Beat Em' Up" by the team at Bandai Namco Entertainment, you can check out the game's original story below: Having been inspired by a famous witch named Shiny Chariot, an ordinary girl named Atsuko (Akko) Kagari enrolls at Luna Nova Magical Academy, a prestigious school for young girls training to become witches. Before starting summer vacation, Akko and her new classmates find out about an inexplicable phenomenon at Luna Nova caused by the Seven Wonders, which has been passed down for several centuries. Now it's up to Akko as she takes on the adventure to unravel the mystery surrounding the Seven Wonders. With just a couple of short months until fans can get their hands on the game, we want to know what you're hoping to see.

Produced by Production I.G. and set to release at an undisclosed time in 2018, the series builds off the original Gainax & Production I.G. anime from early 2000. We've got a feeling we'll be seeing a bit about the series announced during the upcoming Anime Japan, but before that, we've been given a new visual from character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. There's a bit to take in from this image, most notably of which probably includes Haruko Haruhara in the background, as well as the classic Vespa SS 180 that kicked the whole series off almost 18 years ago. Additionally, we see new character Hidomi front and center who you may recognize from the trailer that released some time ago. Also yes, they feature those same Axent Wear look-alike headphones that caused all the controversy when the trailer first released. Set to air as to six-episode series in the United States, FLCL 2 & 3 acts as both a tribute and continuation of the adventures of Haruko Haruhara and Naoto Nandaba. We're excited to see the directions the new season of the series takes us, and hope it leaves the same impact it did all those years ago.

Moga Mogami | SKY-HI goes in on his latest single 'Nani Sama' featuring Boku no Ririkku no Bouyomi, with the music video containing a special appearance from Moga Mogami. |It's been about five years now since I first heard the lyrical-stylings of Tokyo-based rapper SKY-HI when he collaborated with Japanese trackmaker Tofubeats on the mind-melting "Fresh Salad" from his Lost Decade album. Ove those five years, we've seen the growth and progression of SKY-HI in his solo career outside of his usual work with Japanese pop unit AAA. Today we see the next step in that progression with the release of "Nani Sama feat. Boku no Ririkku no Bouyomi," a hard-hitting track featuring incredible production value and lyrics. Released ahead of his upcoming "Best Catalyst" album which is set to release digitally on March 21, the track was shared alongside an extraordinary Atsunori Toushi-directed music video. Those watching the music video might be surprised to spot Moga Mogami in there, playing the focus character in this unbelievably gorgeous music video. I'm not quite sure whether it's a crime to write about Dempagumi.inc, or in this case Dempagumi.inc affiliated artists three days in a row, but I'm doing it anyway.

While much of the rest of the world was logging into the online streaming service weekly to view episodes simulcasted alongside their airing in Japan, the United States had been exempt until the full series finished airing for "binge-viewing" purposes, as Netflix likes to put it. Listed for an April 5 premiere date in the United States, it's time to catch up on the series' first season. Originally airing in Japan on January 10, and becoming available in select regions internationally on January 11, it's taken almost four months for the US to get their hands on the visually spectacular series. Originally catching the eyes of the anime fandom at large following the release of the first CM which utilized some of the most complex animations in a very long time, it immediately hit the must-watch list for many including myself. For those of you unfamiliar, you can find the series' full synopsis below: The Great War finally came to an end after four long years of conflict; fractured in two, the continent of Telesis slowly began to flourish once again. Caught up in the bloodshed was Violet Evergarden, a young girl raised for the sole purpose of decimating enemy lines. Hospitalized and maimed in a bloody skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only words from the person she held dearest, but with no understanding of their meaning. Recovering from her wounds, Violet starts a new life working at CH Postal Services after a falling out with her new intended guardian family. There, she witnesses by pure chance the work of an "Auto Memory Doll," amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper. Moved by the notion, Violet begins work as an Auto Memory Doll, a trade that will take her on an adventure, one that will reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery. If you're curious to check it out, or have been waiting an entire four months to get your Violet Evergarden itch scratched, you can find the series on Netflix, here. |Violet Evergarden, Kyoto Animation, Netflix, Netflix Anime

The EP, which calls on the talents of some of Japan's greatest female artists, went live at 12:00 pm (JST) and has seemingly been making waves both in Japan and around the globe since. We originally broke the news that the EP was in the works just a few months ago, and after all that waiting, we couldn't be happier with the end result. <a href="http://moeshop.bandcamp.com/album/moe-moe">Moe Moe by Moe Shop</a> Looking at the first half of the EP, we open with the shimmering sounds of "Magic (w/ MYLK)," instantly tearing listeners away from the moment and throwing them into a funk-driven groove, straying away from anything the artist has ever put out before. Following that up is the sensual collaboration with Puniden, "Virtual," a tongue-in-cheek story of love that blows me away every time. One of the most requested collaborations in recent memory, both Moe Shop, and YUC'e go above and beyond in "Baby Pink," and I can only hope to see the duo team up again in the future. Jumping to the second half of the EP, we're thrust into the hard-hitting flow of newcomer maisou in "Lovesick," a first-time collaboration for the duo. Breaking through after this is "Notice (w/ TORIENA)," one of the earliest pieces from the EP. Putting down the Gameboy for just a moment to demand "Senpai" to notice her, TORIENA absolutely kills it here. Wrapping the whole EP up is one of my absolute favorites, "Fantasy (w/ MONICO)," a whispy slow-paced track that makes for the perfect end to the EP. Its down tempo leads combined with MONICO's de-tuned vocals send shivers down my spine every time. If you're interested in checking out more of Moe Shop's works, you can find them on both Spotify and Bandcamp. Moe Shop's latest EP "Moe Moe" is available for purchase here.|Moe Shop, Moe Moe, MYLK, Puniden, YUC'e, Maisou, Toriena, Monico

Well, you'll have to pay for that, announces Capcom. |Monster Hunter: World has easily grown to become one of the most popular entries in the Monster Hunter franchise, not just in Japan, but all around the globe. In waves unlike ever before, Capcom is receiving requests and demands from all angles; possibly the most common of which has been calling for the ability to change your characters looks post-creation. Today Capcom took to their Spring 2018 broadcast to announce their answer to that very plea, and boy is it a doozy. The "Hunter Appearance Ticket" is Capcom's answer to the requests of fans; a paid item that will allow fans to finally change up their looks post-creation, which is slated to be added in Spring 2018. There are currently no specifics on dates or pricing, though it has been announced that a "demo" version of the ticket will become available on March 16. There are a few questions that pop into my head, but first of all; why are players about to be charged to change the appearance of their character. Out of all the basic features you'd want from a video game, this is definitely one of them. It's worth mentioning that players have full-ability to change their hairstyles and facial hairstyles in game, but everything else will be part of this paid feature. It'll be interesting to see fan response to this announcement, and you can bet we'll be keeping our eyes on that.

There was always speculation as to what that 'personal career' might entail, but many had hoped it would be a further push in the music scene. We've finally got the musical release that fans were waiting for, but there's just one problem; it's entirely an advertisement for a tights and stockings store. This revelation isn't inherently a bad thing, though I'm not sure if I'm really vibin' to the idea of listening to Moga try and sell me Atsugi The Leg Bar's premium pattern tights for almost 2 minutes. Just take a look for yourself: While the song itself is catchy, and the production definitely keeps me tapping my feet, I just don't know if I'm all for the first piece of musical content from Moga being an advertisement disguised as both a new single and an MV. That being said, this isn't something entirely new for the Japanese music industry, with tracks like Wednesday Campanella's "Gala" immediately coming to mind. What are your thoughts, is this what you had hoped to see from Moga's solo career? If anything, this just has me more excited for her first real release.

This comes just days after we shared that the creatives collaboration with Dempagumi.inc had finally released, something I'm completely okay with. Anime News Network caught the scoop initially and provided an English-language translation of the series synopsis, which can be found below: The manga centers on Shuhei Wakatsuki, a man who lives and works in Tokyo. On New Year's Eve, he decides to take his girlfriend and her son to his old home to see his parents. While driving, memories of his father, with whom he had never gotten along, begin to surface. When they arrive at his parents' house, he and his father silently sit down to watch a New Year's TV show together and begin to talk. Following the usual moody theme presented in Inio Asano's works, it'll be exciting to see where this manga ends up going. Following in the footsteps of incredible works such as Oyasumi Punpun and Solaris, while also filling the void made by Dead Dead Demons Dedede Destruction being on hiatus, we'll certainly be keeping our eyes on Service Area.

From the goofiness of the best character, Jyuushimatsu, all the way to the awkwardness of Choromatsu, each character is represented in an accurate light. The item is currently available as a long-sleeve t-shirt, and it's going to set you back a total of 5,800 yen. This isn't the first time that Galaxxxy has collaborated with these properties either, with both Osomatsu-san and Ultraman individually receiving their own collections in the past.

Lupin will be making a return in his blue suit which was first introduced in the series' fourth part, whilst continuing to offer that same distinct charm and personality that made his character so memorable over the past 50 years.

The jazz-infused single is the group's second collaborative piece with famed Oyasumi Punpun mangaka Inio Asano, with original lyrics written for the group by the creative. Accompanying the single is what I imagine would happen if Stanley Kubrick, Inio Asano, Dempagumi.inc, and a film crew were all left on an island and asked to make a music video -- it's honestly incredible. Arranged by jazz pianist H ZETT M, the song is described as an aggressive jazz-rock single with the energy of Dempagumi.inc and Inio Asano's stylings flowing throughout. Perhaps most interesting about the music video is that it's the first time the group's two latest members have been involved in a group music video project. Both Kaname Rin and Nemoto Nagi have been involved in music videos in the past through their work with Niji no Conquistador, however. Set to release for digital download on April 4, it won't be much longer until we can jam out to "Oyasumi Polaris Sayonara Parallel World" on repeat wherever we are.

13047|2018-03-12|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-progress/| News | Games | Square Enix Job Listing Showcases 'Final Fantasy VII' Remake Progress | Square Enix has recently posted some new job offerings that give a somewhat broad image of just how far away the 'Final Fantasy VII' remake truly could be. |The upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake is quite possibly one of the most hyped video games in recent memory, perhaps only rivaled by the likes of Kingdom Hearts 3 and Super Smash Brothers. For something with so much excitement behind it, however, it might come as a bit of a surprise as to just how little information about the game is actually available when it comes to progress. With that being said, some of the keen eyes over at Siliconera recently spotted a job listing from Square Enix that gives us a loose idea as to just how far off the game really is. "While Final Fantasy VII Remake’s programs for general functions and contents are being tested within the development team as required, the part about reproducing the original work in high-quality graphics is reaching a satisfactory standard, and we’ve come to the conclusion that in order to meet fan expectations we must increase its quality another step higher." "Therefore, in addition to the current members for the Final Fantasy VII Remake development, we must establish a core group that includes level planners, battle planners, designers, engineers, and various types of jobs to tackle on the production of the big title." Let's get this out of the way real quick, nothing stated above in the posting is a bad thing -- it just means that there's still a lot of work to be done. After all, we are talking about an entire remake of a 21-year-old game that's so engraved into the nostalgic memories of most gamers that nothing but perfection is likely to be accepted by the community. The fact that Square Enix is looking at taking a step above what they consider satisfactory is most definitely a good sign, but it also means we're not going to be seeing Final Fantasy VII Remake for quite some time. It's been almost two years since Final Fantasy VII Remake was announced at E3 2015, and Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda has already gone on record stating that it probably won't be another three or more years until we see it. Keeping that in mind, all that we can hope for is that the game doesn't enter delay-hell much like Final Fantasy XIII Vers- ahem... Final Fantasy XV did before it.

The show is scheduled to air weekly on Sunday night and will follow the stories of a group of anthropomorphic horse girls as they pursue their dreams of becoming idols. Originally released as a single-episode ONA in 2016 to promote an upcoming mobile game of the same name, it appears the game would then take an additional two years to release, helping build the case for this anime to exist. The series is being handled by P.A. Works and is part of collaborative efforts from major industry players Cygames, TOHO animation, and Lantis. Directed by Kei Oikawa (Outbreak Company), and featuring scriptwriting from both Akihiko Ishihara and Pierre Sugiura (Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru), the series is set to be, well, something else. You can check out the PV for the upcoming anime below: There's been some pretty big splashes made by Japanese mobile developer Cygames, inc. in the anime industry over the past year, producing some seriously big-name content such as Blade Runner Black Out 2022 and Granblue Fantasy The Animation, not to mention the mammoth Made in Abyss and Yuri!!! on ICE. Generally speaking, they're some of the better taste-makers in the industry, which is why the concept of Uma Masume: Pretty Derby struck me as awkwardly genius, but painfully disingenuous. Taking some of the best performing, most overdone aspects of modern anime and fusing them into a single package, we're left wondering how long it'll be before the streets of Akihabara are filled with otaku spouting their favorite horse daughter.

The anime will be arriving just in time to celebrate the series' 20th anniversary. The series will be calling on Natsume's usual group of collaborators, with Tomohiro Suzuki handling scripts, and Hidehiko Sawada doing character designs.

13037|2018-03-10|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/shonen-jump-act-age-preview/| News | Manga | Previewing New Shonen Jump Acting Series 'ACT-AGE' | We take a look at the latest Shonen Jump series, 'ACT-AGE,' and share our thoughts following the series' initial seven chapter run in the weekly magazine. |Considering the success of Bakuman in it’s run in Weekly Shonen Jump from 2008 to 2012, it was probably only a matter of time before it’s imitators began to show up. Today we'll be taking a look at ACT-AGE, the latest addition to Weekly Shonen Jump stemming from newcomers Tatsuya Matsuki and Shiro Usazaki, who follow in the footsteps of the Death Note and Bakuman powerhouse duo Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata in creating another manga based around the world of a certain profession. This time, however, instead of creating manga, Matsuki and Usazaki center their story around acting. Our protagonist is high-schooler Kei Yonagi, who has always dreamed of becoming an actress and has an amazing latent potential for method acting. Guiding her is genius but mysterious director Kuroyama Sumiji, along with his assistant and Yonagi’s younger siblings. The series is currently in serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump. At the time of writing only seven chapters have been released, but already the series has several key conundrums it needs to address. Firstly, just how well will the two rookie authors cope with the hectic serialization environment? Even the best, most creative authors are whittled down over time – Yoshihiro Togashi, the Hunter x Hunter mangaka, comes to mind – and so it wouldn’t be far-sighted to assume that the duo will face some serious hardships in crafting their story, something that can prove a challenge in pushing consistent quality content. Even if they are a duo and their workload is effectively halved, serialization can be a tough workflow that needs to quickly be adapted to. Secondly, unlike Bakuman, ACT-AGE lacks an inherent central structure to the story, which makes life hard for the authors. Whereas Ohba and Obata could rely on the mechanics of Weekly Shounen Jump, such as weekly rankings and one-shots to springboard their ideas of off; ACT-AGE is not afforded such a luxury. After all, the concept of ‘acting’ is a huge topic and encompasses many mediums, from film and television to radio and theatre. It will take some creativity in finding a central structure for the series, as without one the possibilities of where the series could go are far too broad. In the short term at least, it does seem that the authors are aware of this, and have already moved into a tournament arc in the form of auditions for a movie. However, in the long term, it remains to be seen whether or not the authors can tie the story to a central structure as Bakuman did, which will help sustain the series in the long run. In turn, Bakuman casts a huge shadow over the series. The series’ popularity and commercial success were no doubt one of the reasons that ACT-AGE was approved for serialization in the first place, which is why I keep comparing the two, but to even come close to Bakuman in terms of quality is a hefty goal. For four years and twenty volumes, Bakuman was an expertly paced and told an incredibly insightful story with a vibrant and memorable cast of characters, crafted by two experienced authors at the height of their skill. The latent differences between it and ACT-AGE could not be more apparent. In response to this challenge, the series has two options – either establish itself as a series distinct in identity from Bakuman or match it in terms of quality. Both are equally difficult, but it is imperative that the series addresses the shadow looming over it. Despite these challenges, the series does have a certain charm to it that has kept me excited for each new chapter. Usazaki’s art style is unique but expressive, something essential for a manga about acting. Yonagi’s character design, gangly and seemingly unhealthy, along with her abrasive and quirky personality makes for one of the more interesting Jump protagonists, even if Kuroyama’s self-confident and arrogant personality does seem a little tried and tested in contrast. In addition, much like Bakuman, the series clearly has a passion for the art of acting and has already succeeded in showing many differing, interesting sides to the craft. The first chapter saw Yonagi’s strengths as a method actor in action, with her subconsciously defending her siblings from an imaginary wolf, but was later explored further as a weakness, as she could not stand idle during a scene where a child was murdered despite being told to do so by the director, because it would betray her own thoughts and feelings. This short exploration of how method acting can hinder an actor since they cannot do something that would betray their own experiences has already proven to be an interesting plot point that I’m sure will be explored further. Even though I did point out the potential pitfalls ahead for the rookie authors, I must admit that the series has been, so far, very well paced and developed. Each chapter has served as both a satisfying slice of dramatic action, as well as a tantalizing taste of what is to come. Furthermore, instead of launching straight into the story, the authors took their time in the first seven chapters to firmly establish the characters of Yonagi and Kuroyama, which will serve as an important groundwork for the reader in the future as the series will undoubtedly introduce more characters. Thus, the first seven chapters haven’t been groundbreaking in terms of story events, but since they have served this introductory purpose, they haven’t felt unnecessary or uninteresting. What’s more is that the authors do seem to have somewhat of a plan for the future of the story, as in the last chapter we were finally introduced to the ‘angel’ of the acting world Momoshiro Chiyoko, who was already hinted in the first chapter when she was seen on a billboard that Yonagi was looking up at. This clearly shows that the authors have the future of the series already somewhat sketched out, which will hopefully allow them to continue to pace the story well like they have been doing in the initial chapters. As it stands, these are only initial impressions, but ACT-AGE does seem to have a lot of potentials to become a worthy addition to the Jump line-up, but only if it can effectively navigate the pitfalls ahead of it. I really hope that the authors can overcome their rookie status and go on to create something truly great, something that can rival Bakuman. Even so, until the first volume of the series comes out, I wouldn’t recommend jumping into the series just yet, for fear of it being canceled if a drop in quality occurs.

13033|2018-03-09|17:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/karakuri-circus-anime-potential-leak/| News | Anime | Supposed Leaks Suggest Karakuri Circus is Getting an Anime Adaptation | Leaks have appeared online ahead of an announcement in the upcoming issue of Weekly Shonen Sunday that suggest Kazuhiro Fujita's 'Karakuri Circus' is getting an anime adaptation. |Alleged leaks have surfaced following a Weibo post featuring an image of what appears to be an anime adaptation announcement for Kazuhiro Fujita's 1997 manga series Karakuri Circus. Originally published in Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine, the leaks hold slight value following the detailing that in the upcoming issue of the magazine there would be an important announcement from Kazuhiro Fujita, as detailed in the Mainichi Shinbun. The alleged leak can be seen pictured below: It's clear from the image above that there's quite a bit planned behind this. Listed at the bottom right corner of the post is a link to an official website, which when accessed, requires you to log in to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, there's a Twitter account listed next to that which was originally registered in November 2017, likely around the time of discussion for the anime. That being said, you can never be too careful with these kinds of things, especially with the curiosity of thousands peeked by the mystery surrounding the upcoming announcement from Kazuhiro Fujita. Remember, this is just a rumor we're discussing. Originally published in 1997, Karakuri Circus follows the story of Masaru Saiga. The story is kicked off with the death of his father, who leaves behind 18 billion yen in inheritance solely for Masaru. This sparks jealousy in his half-relatives and his uncle, who all eventually set out to murder or abduct Masaru. The full synopsis of the story can be found below: Katou Narumi suffers from Zonapha Syndrome, a rare ailment that stops his breathing unless he makes people laugh. He's been forced to abandon his training in Chinese kenpo and return to Japan, where he now works as a clown. The only problem: he's not very funny. One day he meets Saiga Masaru, the recent inheritor of a huge fortune, who gives him the first laugh he's gotten all day. When he realizes Masaru is being pursued by assassins, he steps in to protect the boy, only to discover that instead of conventional weapons, the assassins wield huge, eerie puppets. They soon encounter the mysterious Shirogane, who controls a puppet of her own, and claims she was sent from France by Masaru's late grandfather to protect him. Their paths intertwine and diverge, splitting into two stories: Karakuri and Circus, puppets and performers, tears and laughter. The strange circus of living dolls that spreads Zonapha Syndrome, the human puppets known collectively as the Shirogane, and the puppeteers whose undying grudge set in motion both sides of this performance. With just a few more days until we finally find out what the big revelation is in regards to the author, it'll be interesting to see if this supposed leak holds any value. Until then, however, we'll just have to wait and see. Don't forget, this is just a rumor, so don't take it with too much face value. |Karakuri Circus, Karakuri Circus Anime, Kazuhiro Fujita, Weekly Shonen Sunday

Oh, and we got a new key visual too. |Announced via the Re:Zero official website earlier today, the anime series will be receiving an original OVA episode with simultaneous theatrical screenings across Japan. While there's yet to be much information revealed regarding the OVA episode, we've got our first look at the release through the key visual showcased on the website. Let's take a look at that below: While I mentioned that we still don't know too much regarding the upcoming anime series, we're likely to find out more during the AnimeJapan 2018 stage event which is taking place on March 24. We'll be on the floor at the event, and will be sure to give you updates as their announced. Originally released in 2016, the anime adaptation of the Re:Zero rapidly rose to become one of the most talked about anime of the season. The full synopsis of the show can be found below: Natsuki Subaru, an ordinary high school student, is on his way home from the convenience store when he finds himself transported to another world. As he's lost and confused in a new world where he doesn't even know left from right, the only person to reach out to him was a beautiful girl with silver hair. Determined to repay her somehow for saving him from his own despair, Subaru agrees to help the girl find something she's looking for.

Based on the Meruru face mask worn by Sagiri during her live stream illustration sessions, the mug is currently available for pre-order with 22 days to go. Oh, and for those who do pick up the mug within the pre-order period, you'll also be receiving a custom sticker featuring the word "Pantsu" as written in calligraphy by Sagiri's voice actress, Akane Fujita. Why don't we take a look at the package: Now listen, let's get one thing out of the way; I was, unfortunately, an absolute sucker for Eromanga Sensei's predecessor Oreimo. With that being said, when I saw a clear tribute to the best character from the series, Stardust Witch Meruru, thrust into the spotlight through Sagiri's illustration sessions, I had two questions: "Where is the standalone Meruru anime?," and "Where do I get that mask?". Fortunately enough I can actually get my hands on a mask via Cospa, but that didn't quite satisfy my needs. No, I needed even more Meruru in my life. Back to the topic at hand though, the 3D mask cup is made of porcelain material and supposedly rests pleasantly in the hand. It's no larger than your average coffee cup in size but obviously rocks that ever-present Meruru face mask on the front. Estimated to release April 2018, the mug is currently open for pre-orders for the next 22 days. Priced at 1,480 yen for domestic delivery, and 1,980 yen for deliveries outside of Japan, within the realm of anime merch this is a perfectly reasonable price. If you're interested in checking out the product, you can head over to the official website for further details.

13029|2018-03-09|10:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/what-you-missed-japanese-nintendo-direct/| News | Games | Here's What You Missed From the Japanese Nintendo Direct | With the Nintendo Switch being a region-free console, it's worth knowing what games were announced exclusively in the Japanese Nintendo Direct. |Today was an absolutely incredible day for owners of the Nintendo Switch. Not only was it announced that Super Smash Bros. would be coming to the hybrid console later this year, but we'll also be receiving games such as Mario Tennis Ace, Crash Bandicoot (Yes, that's right), and more. Chances are a lot of you tuned in to the Nintendo Direct this morning and watched in awe as these titles were announced, but what you may not have known is that simultaneously there was a Japanese Direct taking place -- only this Direct featured a few extra titles not yet detailed for a Western release. The Nintendo Switch is one of Nintendo's first truly region-free home consoles, and it's important that we make the most of that. I mean, after all, it is one of the console's greatest features, and is also a feature I appreciated greatly when I had to import a Switch due to lack of availability in Japan. So why don't we take a look at that list of games announced during the Japanese Nintendo Direct this morning and dissect just why I'm so excited: 1. Taiko no Tatsujin: Nintendo Switch Version (21:43 - 22:35) [Summer 2018] If there was ever a title to be excited about, this would have to be it. I'm absolutely 200% behind the Taiko no Tatsujin rhythm game franchise, and can't wait to get my hands on the Switch version. Both at home on the Nintendo Wii version of the game, as well as at the arcade, Taiko no Tatsujin definitely takes up a large portion of my week, so having that on the go is going to be great. That being said, there are a few things to address. For one, we're yet to see an actual drum attachment for the Switch, which is you know -- the whole point of the game. While the concept of using your controllers in air-motion does sound... fun, there's nothing like the real drum. One can only hope that some more information is revealed regarding that before the game's summer 2018 release. 2. SaGa Scarlet Grace (23:24 - 24:30) [2018] Originally released in Japan back in 2016 on PlayStation Vita, SaGa Scarlet Grace is bursting onto the Nintendo Switch in Japan. Announced simultaneously outside of the Nintendo Direct were releases for PlayStation 4, PC, and mobile, though there's been no confirmation of an international release. With that being said, due to the generally wide-array of consoles its being distributed to, as well as the publisher, being Square Enix, I wouldn't be surprised if an announcement is made in the near future. I'm sure we'll be hearing more before the game releases at some point during 2018. 3. Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud (24:32 - 25:20) [April 4, 2018] Possibly one of the most requested MMOs of all time internationally, Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud is set to release on the Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2018. The free to play MMORPG thrusts players into new reaches of the galaxy, filled with quests and bosses to slay. This version of the game, in particular, is run via the SEGA online servers, meaning no more than the client will actually be on the Switch unit, the gameplay is simply streamed. Announced during the stream was also exclusive collaborative items, including Link's Breath of the Wild outfit. There's definitely a whole lot to look forward to this year on the Nintendo Switch, and you can definitely add these games to your list of games to be excited about. I'm itching to get my hands on both Taiko no Tatsujin and Phantasy Star Online 2 Cloud, and can't wait to see what the Switch version brings to the table for both games. Now we just sit and wait until E3 for more information on Super Smash Bros., right?|Nintendo Direct, Japanese Nintendo Direct, Japanese Switch Games, Japan Switch, Taiko no Tatsujin, Taiko no Tatsujin Nintendo Switch, SaGa Scarlet Grace

An extreme crisis will befall the five of you someday. At that time, you five will protect everyone." Daisuke Dōjima is a second-year high school student who, as a child, was kidnapped.

Titled Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System, the announcement was teased through a glance at the series' history, followed by the revelation of three cases. Update: It's been confirmed that this will be a new trilogy of films, each tackling a different case. The order of these cases will be as follows: Case 1: Crime and Punishment [Mika & Gino] Case 2: First Guardian [Teppei & Tomomi] Case 3: Beyond Love and Hate [Shinya] The preview for this announcement can be found below: Originally aired in 2012, Psycho-Pass rapidly became a fan-favorite around the globe. The synopsis for the series can be found below: Justice, and the enforcement of it, has changed. In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work. Into this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt. While not too much is currently known about the upcoming anime project beyond what was shown in the teaser, we'll be sure to keep you up to date as further information is revealed.

If I remember correctly, it was some time towards the end of 2017 that I was made to believe that Mario had retired from his position. With just a simple edit to a bio on a website, an entire part of history was removed, with the world crumbling around me as I knew it. Well, I'm sure we're all pleased to know that the character's position has now returned to its former state of being, though it is noted that he's not entirely limited to that very role. This would, in theory, leave a contractual loophole allowing his work as both a doctor and painter; oh, and I guess he can save the princess too. While none of this actually matters, I guess I can now go to bed in peace knowing that the hardworking boy is at least being recognized for the job he does. Or wait, maybe the one he doesn't do?

On March 5th we saw the launch of the new Jump Party celebration website, with the taunting tagline of “How much can you read?” By clearing minigames and other assorted ‘missions’ on the website, Jump fans can get their hands on ‘tickets’ with which they can use to read manga for – that’s right, you heard correctly – free. These minigames seem fairly simple, comprising of spot the difference; sliding puzzles and matching puzzles, meaning it shouldn’t be particularly hard to get your hands on tickets to read some of that sweet, sweet, free shonen manga. The line-up is also nothing to be scoffed at. The so-called “legends” are all there, such as JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Parts 1 to 6, as well as the long-running Kochikame and the seminal Dragon Ball. Modern classics such as Assassination Classroom, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Death Note will also be available. Furthermore, all the shonen powerhouses from One Piece to Naruto will be there right alongside newer series such as Dr. STONE, My Hero Academia and ROBOT x LASERBEAM, although whether they will be available in full or not is another issue entirely. My personal favorite Jump series Medaka Box is even included, which got me on board almost immediately. In addition, there is a social aspect to the website that seems key to obtaining tickets. You will be able to create ‘parties’ with your friends, with which you will share ticket rewards with each other, as well as gain extra ones if your party clears certain challenges. Chatrooms have also been implemented, but I imagine that these will be heavily monitored in order to maintain a child-friendly environment. As of the time of writing, I wasn’t able to access the website on my phone to try it out for myself, so I would encourage anyone interested to check it out for themselves here. Celebrating 50 years of Jump by reading free manga seems like a pretty good deal, no?|Shonen Jump, Weekly Shonen Jump, Jump Party, Free Manga
13008|2018-03-07|04:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/ikuhara-sarazanmai-2nd-pv/| News | Anime | Ikuhara's New 'Sarazanmai' Anime Receives a 2nd Teaser Trailer | Just one day after its reveal, Mappa has released a 2nd trailer for 'Sarazanmai.' |Just one day after its official reveal, a Studio Mappa has released a second teaser trailer for creator and director Kunihiko Ikuhara's newest anime project, Sarazanmai. It was released at a similarly odd time at night, so I'm beginning to wonder if the midnight hours or darkness will be playing a significant role in the show. I mean, the trailers certainly cast no doubts about the fact that everything will not be sunshine and happiness... Take a look at the new teaser below. This time, the text reads: Am I a lie? Is the world a lie? Are we all lies? Don't let go, that desire is your life. The narrator chimes in: We are connected, but that is detestable. But at the same time, it's desirable. Who is the one with a strong desire? For comparison's sake, let's check out the first trailer once more. The text in the trailer reads: Even if all is lost and the world becomes empty. Don't let go, that desire is your life. The narrator adds a bit on top: I'm going to tell you the truth. You may be connected, but you're alone. Don't let go, that desire is your life. Obvious differences in the trailers can be observed, and we can already glean a few hints about what we can expect come next year, when the anime is scheduled to air. Presumably, the characters in the anime will share some kind of connection -- a bond or a relationship. As in many of Ikuhara's previous works, relationships can be... complicated, to say the least. Fans will likely be able to take solace in the fact that thematically, Ikuhara is remaining on point. The biggest piece of imagery in the first trailer is a pair of familiar symbols for "man," as can be found on restroom signs, lying parallel to each other, yet facing opposite directions. A splash of pink paint is featured in the background. In the second trailer, it appears to be an otter enclosed within a heart set on top of some blue paint. Ikuhara's shows have never been lacking in animal imagery, what with the penguins and bears and whatnot. Are otters set to get their turn in the spotlight this time? Since the reveal yesterday, fans from Japan have been making an amusing connection between the name of the show, Sarazanmai, and a popular sushi restaurant chain called "Sushizanmai." Oh, and by the way; "zanmai" in Japanese can be translated as "indulgence," or "luxury." That sushi sure looks luxurious, so now we just have to figure out that "sara" part. And if I could point out one last little detail myself, please take note of the three circles below the title in the official logo. They appear to be "connected" via some fancy line work, but upon closer inspection, all of those circles are separated, aren't they? Neither line forms a complete set of two. At this point, I'm just hoping that new info continues to come out at a similarly breakneck pace, and I am expecting it to drop at 1 am every single time. If you are interested in reading more on the initial reveal of Sarazanmai, be sure to check out our report here. It includes a special Tweet from Ikuhara himself!

How many styles can you recognize? |Have you ever found yourself enjoying any manner of those "Identify the anime something or other" videos online? How many anime OP sequences, songs, clips, and characters can you correctly identify? Are you ready to put your eye for animation to the test once more? How about identifying all of the iconic styles from both Japanese and Western animation in Animax Channel's newest TV commercial? このアニマックスのCM、色々な面で凄いと思うし、色々な面でアウトである pic.twitter.com/2lZEReT8at — 『星の子ポロン』で検索！ (@tatu_zihou) March 3, 2018 There are a few good-sized chunks of instantly-recognizable styles that even the most casual of viewers are sure to catch. On the anime side of things, as soon as our friend Max is snatched away by the dragon, we can see the heroine snap into a signature JoJo pose, complete with thick lines on her clothing. She immediately turns into a starry-eyed bishoujo, and transforms in a sequence that anyone who ever watched morning-time cartoons can recognize as being straight out of a Sailor Moon episode. As she takes flight, is that a Powerpuff Girls homage I see? The Western animation nods continue with some classic Disney styling and even a split-second Moomins reference. The commercial finishes off strong with a classic Gundam battle sequence, and an ending that is sure to make even Makoto Shinkai proud with that signature your name. sunlight in the background. In Japan, the Animax Channel is undisputedly the largest, most-watched piece of the airwaves dedicated to animation of all kinds. It boasts 24-hour programming, and has subsidiary channels in many countries across Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In addition to Japanese anime, the channel has broadcast animated shows from around the globe, and takes care of dubbing into Japanese language in-house. This kind of commercial perfectly captures the legacy of Animax, and what it has meant to fans of animation since its inception in 1998. Of course, I only scratched the surface with some of the most easily-recognizable styles in the video. There are at least 20 references or so -- what other styles were you able to recognize?

With their reunion, the group ushered in a new age of m-flo -- one that looked forward to the future, whilst also clinging to the very moment that brought them together over 20 years ago. #mflo iTunes 総合アルバムチャート 1位に The Tripod EP 9位に Back2TheFuture remix album なんと2つ同時ランクインしてます。引き続きサポートよろしくお願いします！ https://t.co/ZeUYPfKGAw pic.twitter.com/vF5sTFglIe — Taku Takahashi m-flo新EP iTunesでリリースしました (@takudj) 5 March 2018 With two incredible decades of history to their name, the group is back and better than ever with their latest "the tripod e.p.2". Made available both digitally and physically as of today, the release near-instantly shot to the top of the iTunes Japan album chart sitting at #1, showing that the excitement over here in Japan is very, very real. Ahead of this release, however, we sat down with m-flo to discuss their latest works, as well as what they’ve been doing over these past few years. You can find our interview in full below: OTAQUEST: I saw the video for "No Question" and it was really sick, but there was one thing that really stood out -- something I'm sure stood out for everyone. LISA, you cut your hair for the video. I know the song has this message of not holding yourself to society’s standards and being your own person, was that what influenced your decision to do this for the video? LISA: Oh yeah, definitely. Because first, they couldn’t ask me to do that directly because they all thought I wasn’t going to be down with that idea. They actually had a model, or a couple models, ready to shave their head and everything. That came later when we were coming back from LA, they said “Yeah, we’re looking for models that are going to go bald for us.” and I was like “WHAT? What is that? No, we write our own songs! To express what we’re writing in that music, I *have* to do it. I’m gonna do it.” And from there it was “Oh, you’re gonna do it? Wow, cool! Let’s do it!” So you know, it's a message coming from me too. Coming from so many directions that I couldn’t really express it to you, how I really feel about this head that I have right now. Hopefully, people will know that what we’re trying to make here is art, a form of art. Every song is art, every music video is our piece of art. VERBAL: If I might add, when we were in LA we were already thinking about shooting the video as soon as we got back to Tokyo. But then that got postponed, fortunately. Because of that, we’re able to maneuver to have this whole video situation happen with the storyline. The treatment that we received was, like LISA said, a model, a woman shaving her head as an expression of m-flo kind of evolving, and reforming, and taking new steps. As you might remember in "Come Again," back in like 2001, we had this model moving on from her past memories and past boyfriend or whatever. That was the blueprint for this new video, but when we spoke about that, quickly going back to what LISA said, she was like “Why don’t I do this?” That was the big elephant in the room that everyone wanted to ask, but we were like “Yeah, we can’t ask LISA to shave her head. Who’s gonna break that news?” and Taku’s like “I’m not gonna do it!” *laughs* But yeah, when we had brought it up she was just like “I’ll do it” and that was perfect because that just like consummated, and brought everything together. LISA: On top of that it’s our stuff so I couldn't have anybody else go bald. It totally had to be me! After all, this is our stuff, c’mon man! So I was really happy to do it, “I’ll do it, I’ll do it, I’ll do it.” *laughs* OTAQUEST: So you mention it being your stuff, but another thing is that the video has different segments. Everybody kind of has their own thing until you get to the very end of the video. Did you have input on each other’s segments for the video at all? Did you have that kind of creative control or discussion about what everyone was going to be doing over the course of the video? VERBAL: Well I think generally... LISA: Me, my whole thing is about going bald so that’s really simple you know? That’s just like my stuff so... VERBAL: Well yeah, I think that was going to be the main crux of the video, and LISA was going to represent m-flo’s evolution, taking the new steps and such. I think us being in different scenes until we meet at the end, that’s just to symbolize that we were going on different paths over the past 15 years when we weren’t together. And then at the end, you see the part where all of the old video flashbacks, and then she starts shaving her head, so that’s a message. And then at the end, we get back together; the newly reformed m-flo from here on in. Taku: Yeah, rolling on from what VERBAL said, usually with this kind of thing, LISA lets the two of us decide what we want to do with the video. She fully trusts our direction and vision. When both VERBAL and I sat down with the director we proposed that we wanted something out of the ordinary -- we wanted to catch people off-guard like something by Michel Gondry. We quickly pinpointed that nobody had really built upon this time reversal concept introduced to us through the music video for Pharcyde's "Drop," and we thought that could work here. I figured it would help signify us going back to our roots. After we suggested that, the director hit us with the idea of having a model shave her head and go bald in reverse as mentioned earlier. We were all for it but finding someone who would actually do it was a little more difficult than we imagined *laughs*. As it turns out, LISA actually overheard us talking about it one day, and said she'd do it "for the art." The video ended up changing a bit because she took the role, but I was totally behind it given the nature of her lyrics and the powerful new message in the video. OTAQUEST: The ending was also really powerful, at least I think, like when you all got together on stage. There’s a moment where LISA comes in and you hug VERBAL, then hug Taku, and it seems super genuine. Almost to the point where it might have just been that the camera was rolling and it happened, and you decided to keep it for the video. Is that how it went? LISA: *starts laughing* VERBAL: She didn’t want to do that! *everyone laughs* LISA: I hated that part! No, I’m just kidding. I just kept laughing and laughing, because that was the director's idea. VERBAL: The director was like “Can you just hug?”, and it’s kind of like someone going “Oh, you speak Japanese? Yeah, Speak. Japanese.” Uhh, okay. *laughs* LISA: It just sounded really cheesy to me at first. We took so many shots of that too, like 4 to 5 times because we just kept laughing. The director said “You do this all the time, so it should come naturally.” and I thought “You know what? You’re right. We do hug and greet each other like that every time we see each other, so okay.” The last time was the shot that they used right? VERBAL: Yeah. We were just cracking up, it was a long day so we were just like joking about everything. It was good times on the set. Taku: Yeah, LISA absolutely hated the idea of it in the beginning *laughs*. It wasn't until VERBAL reminded her "Hey when you see us in the studio, how do you greet us?," and I guess that's usually what we do, so it made it look a little more natural. OTAQUEST: It looked really really genuine. I seriously thought it was like an ad-libbed shot like “Oh they just walked in to shoot for the day and LISA gave the guys a hug!” It looked great. LISA: Hey, we can just put it like that! *laughs* It sounds good like that! OTAQUEST: So VERBAL, you've done everything from the "loves series," all the way to the "Square One" period, with each era being filled with new and different sounds. In the new EP, all of the songs contain a blend of classic "tripod era," along with the stuff in-between and a dash of modern music influence. Did the fact that you were tackling a classic sound have an influence on the way you wrote your rap segments in the new songs? VERBAL: Actually, us getting back together was already a total vibe. It was kind of nostalgic but fresh at the same time because over the years Taku and I had been doing our thing, and LISA was doing her thing. Then, of course, everything in our respective fields we do according to the different kinds of work that we do. When it comes to m-flo, we’ve known each other for a while and we’re just open about everything. Going back to the question, it really did, but what set me off was when LISA told me was that my rap as of late was kind of “not up to par” and “kinda boring.” She was like “You know you can be crazier than that, how come you’re writing lyrics so conservatively?” I didn’t even think about it that way, I was like “Really? Okay.” So I pulled out my old lyric books, I have pads and pads of lyrics from back in the late 90s and early 2000s -- I would write mad lyrics. So I was just looking back, trying to get that groove back. Getting bits and pieces from the kind of words I used to use, the kind of flow I used to have, so when I hit the studio I was feeling her vibe in the studio watching her sing. It’s been a minute since we got in the studio, you know? And after seeing her sing “No Question” I was like “Okay, I got it.” and I started writing the rap for the song. Then I told LISA “Watch me.” and I went into the studio... LISA: I was like “YES. NICE.” VERBAL: So like, we went to international school and naturally we speak English and Japanese, but our Japanese is not so perfect and that’s how it was on our first two albums. It’s Japanese, but it doesn’t really sound Japanese; my grammar was wrong, and it wasn’t intentional, but it created kind of a fun vibe. I think that’s what she referred to as being kind of crazy or fun, so now that I speak Japanese better than before I deliberately kind of use certain words and plug them in so it sounds kind of awkward in a fun way. I sound passive aggressive on my verses. So that was the intention, I think that’s what really triggered the laughter in the studio. Taku loved it too. LISA: I loved it, I just stood up and went “FANTASTIC!” *laughs* OTAQUEST: So you mentioned the Japanese & English part of it too and it makes me wonder, "No Question" in itself is the kind of phrase that’s common in English. When you write English in your songs do you ever think about how that’s going to translate to Japanese fans or vice versa? Like if you use Japanese phrases or plays on words do you worry about how that’s going to translate to fans in English? VERBAL: For me personally, our music is just like “m-flo music.” It’s not Japanese or English. So when people in English hear the Japanese parts I feel like they just listen to it for how it sounds. Japanese people out here, when they go to this club in Shibuya called Harlem and listen to like Kendrick Lamar, they don’t know what he’s saying but they’ll be like “Aww, this is cool. I like this song” or whatever. It’s the same thing, It’s almost like an instrument. LISA’s vocals and my vocals, you know? So vice versa, in Japan when we sing in English they just think it’s the melody, or it’s the flow. I think in a nutshell m-flo represents a certain unique blend and world of its own. So I don’t think people really care so much, LISA could be singing in Spanish and I don’t think people would really care. And she would too. LISA: I would. And will do so too. Gotta use that Latina side of me, right? OTAQUEST: So in a recent interview you had made mention as to how technology has made things easier for everyone to create similar sounding music. Listening to the tracks on the new EP there is a definite feeling of modern music but still very classic m-flo in each of the tracks. Did you use any of the processes of the original m-flo albums to create this feeling, or did you utilize modern technology in any interesting ways to receive the results we can hear in the new songs? Taku: What I did was I went back to the process I used, or the one we used to use when we were making "Expo Expo." The plan for me was to create something that was like, "What if m-flo made something future bass-ish in the tripod era?" That "-ish" part is super important to me because I totally realize people aren't interested in m-flo creating something exactly like what's being played on Billboard's Top 40 or any other EDM hit. Being "-ish" is what makes us so unique, you know? OTAQUEST: So during the recording process on the new EP, I know you came to LA and did a bunch of songwriting. Now that you've got some songs out in the wild, how are you feeling about the process for everything and where you’re moving towards with this upcoming album? LISA: Well I'm just very happy that we’re finally going to be able to release this EP because it feels like it’s been a while that we’ve been working on this. I don’t know what it is? Like 8 months to a year? Trying to get everything together, trying to get us together, getting things set up with the company and getting our staff together. It’s not just the music, it’s everything else that comes around it too. So to me, it’s like “Hey, I’ve been waiting for this.” I'm just truly happy that it’s coming out finally. It felt really long for me until we put this together. VERBAL: Yeah, so this EP coming together is kind of like for the fans. This kind of diverts from the question but, with all of the logistics we had to take care of, that was nothing for us because we really look forward to bringing this back for the fans who have been telling us on separate occasions “Why don’t you get back together with LISA?” or “When are you gonna do m-flo again?,” “Stop doing these other projects”. LISA: Me too, people are like “I don’t want to hear your solo, I want to hear you back in m-flo!” VERBAL: But those are very important and very brave messages that fans would tell us. I could be like “Hey, fuck you, man.” *laughs* I could be a dick about it, but then we actually appreciate all of these comments. Some people have even been saying things since we came out with our first record. They would come to the clubs that we DJ at and be like “Yo man, so when are you gonna come out with the next m-flo record?” and I’m like “Okay, here we go again!” Because they’re also like “Yo VERBAL, you should rap more like this!” or “You should tell LISA to come back!” and I’m like “We’re working on it!” I kind of consider our getting back together almost like Lauryn Hill getting back together with The Fugees. Not to toot our own horn, but I think it’s something that people thought “Wow, that would be cool if that happens but we don’t think it’s going to really happen.” We’re excited about it, for sure. Taku: Jumping back to the original question real quick, we actually made a lot of tunes during the LA songwriting camp, but we're still not certain when our album is coming out. We might even be releasing another EP. We'll just have to wait and see. The experience at LA was awesome, we tried different things and now we see something that we can do more. I think I'll be able to answer what we're planning to do next time I see you guys. OTAQUEST: Talking about the EP and the development of the songs, having a newer sound along with the classic style -- was there any difference to how you got together creatively when you’re putting a song together? You kind of already touched on having that resurgence of the way you felt back in the day, but putting stuff together now, especially with technology being so different, has there been anything that’s complicated the process, or made it easier at all? Or anything that has influenced the way everything comes together versus the way it used to be? VERBAL: Taku was mentioning this, but because of the technological advances everyone can sound exactly like Skrillex if they felt like it. It’s easy, you have all of the presets going and everyone has every type of resource at their fingertips. So he deliberately went back to using specific equipment, stuff that wasn't necessarily efficient, but it kinda brought back that sound. It brought back that vibe. Me too, going back to what I was saying about bringing back my old lyric books, I was kind of going back to the analog vibe rather than researching online and getting ideas. I’m just going back to myself and going back to the roots. And then with LISA, she was really quick with it. Even back in LA when she had the flu, she was pumping out songs and getting mad at me for not working quickly *laughs* LISA: I was like “Where’s your rap!” Every time I see him I’d ask him! Taku: When it comes to trends, most think music creativity is about speed; but I think the complete opposite. I think patience is the most important factor when creating music. I build it and break it over and over until I get it done. Sometimes it works, and most of the time it doesn't. I just keep on doing trial and error until I find the right one. Sure, it'd be easy to create something trendy, but what we're creating is totally different -- I can't just put a benchmark to it. OTAQUEST: Well that’s everything about the EP I wanted to ask about, but I also wanted to talk about the remix album. Did you have input on the artists that were selected and what they worked on? How do you feel about how the remix album came together? VERBAL: So that’s totally Taku’s department; if he had asked me who I wanna have remix, I would have my people but I was like “Yo, that’s like your lane.” He knows all of the dope producers, he interviews them, works with them at block.fm, and it just makes sense that it’s uniform as part of the m-flo universe. Like the DNA will be more straightforward if he single-handedly selected the producers. I had asked him “Can you just come up with a list of people?” and when he did, we just had nothing to say. We were like “That’s dope.” It’s all kind of fresh, it’s not pretentious. I don’t know if that’s the right word, but it’s really honest. He just selected them on the basis of whether they’re dope or not, or whether they’re relevant or not. So we were all in agreement, LISA and I had nothing to say. OTAQUEST: Building off what VERBAL just shared, we were surprised by some of the remixers you chose, especially with the massive spectrum of genres and music scenes they all stem from. How did you decide which artists you wanted to include on the album? Taku: It wasn't just me, but my manager actually helped me a lot. She's also the executive of block.fm, so she knows a whole heap of awesome upcoming artists. Some of the artists I met through anime conventions in the US, and I simply loved their performances and sets. Thanks to the Attack the Music boys for that. OTAQUEST: Were there any remixes that stood out to you as particularly great? VERBAL: When I heard the Canblaster one, it was cool because you can tell he likes m-flo a lot. Because he asked Taku to send him stems from different songs, he would incorporate that in a remix of a song that had nothing to do with the other songs. It’s like an homage to our other tracks from the past. We felt that love from the other remixers too, because they had put in the time and they’re all kind of sharing their knowledge of our catalog. So that was really nice, not to mention super dope. I can’t wait to play them at clubs or hear other people play them at clubs too. LISA: The last one that came in that Taku sent, Come Again. There was so much going on when I was listening to it I was like “This one’s fuckin’ PHAT”. I think that was the PKCZ remix. That one I love because it just stopped me. I was like “What is this? Wow.” Taku: Personally I really loved all of them, they all had such different styles and none sounded like any other. Even the Masayoshi Iimori and Carpainter tracks went totally different directions, even though they're label mates. Oh, and LISA, you mentioned you loved the Masayoshi Iimori remix too, right? *laughs* I'm sure a lot of OTAQUEST readers loved the YUC'e, DJ Shimamura, TeddyLoid, and banvox remixes too. I'd definitely recommend checking out Sweet Williams and WONK too if you've never heard of them. OTAQUEST: So earlier you mentioned that you had your own solo stuff in the past, and LISA you’ve obviously had your solo albums and songwriting over the years. How is that impacting the development of everything going on, from like the creative side, the songwriting side, etc? Has there been any major change in how you do anything as a result of your experience? LISA: What’s kind of clear is that what I make for m-flo, it sounds like it’s just for m-flo. It’s so weird because it’s the same me making this and making that, but when I make it with them it’s just some magic that comes in. I don’t know what it is, it’s just fit and customized for m-flo. To me, it’s just a mystery where it comes from, but when I do stuff for myself versus doing stuff with them there’s just something very different about it. And what’s for them is just for them, I wouldn’t even want to take it back and sing it myself. It’s like “Take it, and if you don’t take it then I dunno, let it sit.” VERBAL: For me just working on different projects made me realize that I like being in groups rather than my own solo thing. I had done that before a couple times with the underground projects like L Universe or my other solo projects. And it was because people were like “You should do your solo thing.” and I’m like “Okay, I’ll try it.” But it didn’t really last long because that’s that and it’s cool, and there are people who enjoy that, but I just like working in groups. I get inspired, you know? Like LISA said, when I work with m-flo it’s totally m-flo and I’m like that guy who gives the killer pass, I’m not the striker. LISA is definitely the striker in the group. I like getting the projects up and running and just producing the content around it. The more I work on different projects, the more I know what I’m good at and what lane I’m good staying in, so when it came time to doing m-flo I knew exactly what to do. It took a long time to explain to LISA why I come in at the very end *laughs*, because I wanted to make sure everything’s up and running and she’s got the vocals laid down. I like to make sure I’m supporting the whole song through the rap or whatever I do. That’s why I come in at the end, it’s not because I’m lazy *laughs* Taku: *laughs* Well, one thing for sure is I re-discovered myself through meeting people in the US. It is so cool to actually interact with people who liked what I was doing back then. Five years ago was about myself creating perfect dance/electronic music, but now I'm into creating perfect m-flo music. OTAQUEST: I have one last question to wrap things up, I don’t know if you’ve really paid attention to the fan response to everything so far. I'm talking about things like the teaser, the announcement, everything surrounding that. How do you feel about the fan response so far and do you have any messages for your fans? LISA: I’m just very happy that they’re happy, and we’re very happy that they’re happy. I can’t wait to do the concerts and have them come and see us, have a good time with us, and sing our songs together with us. Because you know, we don’t just perform, we like to have our fans make the whole stage with us. I really just can’t wait until we do our tour, or concerts, or whatever it might be. We gotta get out there fast for them. Overall I’m just really happy about everything. I thank the lord every day that he gave me the chance to come back in this group and that our staff is still supporting us. It’s the same people that did m-flo originally, they’re still here with us so this is not just an everyday kind of thing that happens. I truly believe it’s a miracle. VERBAL: I would say the same thing, I’m just happy. You don’t understand, when we broke the news about m-flo so many people, random people from random fields, wrote me that hour when the news broke. Like Becky wrote to me, the CEO of YG Entertainment Japan wrote me and was like “I always loved m-flo!”, real estate moguls, artists wrote me. J Soul Brothers Omi wrote me and was like “I was always a fan, can I do something with you guys?” This really random set of people, and not just from Japan but even people from the states. I didn’t even know they knew m-flo so it was really nice. And fans online too, the stuff they write is really encouraging and it’s a testament that this is right thing we’re doing. We’re really excited to make more songs, for them. Taku: The cool thing I realized in the Youtube comments was that there are both Japanese and English reactions to it. So many positive and encouraging comments from all around the world. It really means a lot to us and we are seriously trying to go around the world to meet you guys. Thank you so much for your support. Feeling more refreshed than perhaps ever before, it really does feel like 2018 is going to be the year of m-flo. Sitting on top of the iTunes charts at #1 with the release of ‘the tripod e.p.2, topping the YouTube Japan trending charts with the music video for “No Question,” and crafting the soundtrack for the upcoming “Last Winter, We Parted” film, we can’t wait to see where the tripod go next.

Released in Japan on February 28, the album presents itself as one of the freshest sounding collection of music in recent years, playing out as a coherent and curious glance into the musical movement taking over the streets of Tokyo. She's a modern forerunner in the girl power movement that's been breaking through lately, with songs like "Watashi" on constant repeat over the course of the last year via the likes of Space Shower TV and MTV Japan. It's now been a year since I first heard iri through the likes of that very breakthrough track, and over the course of that year the artist would go on to refine her voice into something unlike anything else. Within the confines of "Juice" and its incredible 12 song tracklist, iri would call on and collaborate with several of Japan's best producers, including the likes of Suiyobi no Campanella's Kenmochi Hidefumi, Lucky Tape's own Takahashi Kai, WONK, and so many other talented creators. iri is the embodiment of the new sounds sweeping the streets of Tokyo, offering an unparalleled sound that both energizes and relaxes the moment. The album's second song, "Corner," is a perfect example of this feeling; opening with a downtempo synth-filled lead before tugging listeners along to the contagious vibe presented through both iri's vocals and the backing instrumental. If you're a fan of Japan's numerous music scenes, you'll definitely want to keep your eyes on iri as she continues to make waves in her home country. With her first live tour about to take place to numerous sold-out venues, the hype is definitely real, and with good reason. Don't sleep on iri in 2018, and be sure to check out her latest album "Juice" on both iTunes and Spotify.|iri, Juice, japanese music, J-Pop, JPOP

Unless we're talking about Kunihiko Ikuhara, the prolific creator of Revolutionary Girl Utena, Mawaru Penguindrum, and episode director of Sailor Moon, of course. With Tweets from both his personal account and retweets from Studio Mappa, the creatives upcoming anime series Sarazanmai was announced for a 2019 debut. The text in the trailer reads: Even if all is lost and the world becomes empty. Don't let go, that desire is your life. The narrator adds a bit on top: I'm going to tell you the truth. You may be connected, but you're alone. Don't let go, that desire is your life. From the trailer, it is clear that it will be a joint production between studios Mappa (Yuri on Ice, Kakkegurui, Inuyashiki) and Lapin Track (Yuri Kuma Arashi). Ikuhara is one my favorite directors working in the industry at the moment without a doubt. Stretching the limits of imagination and commanding a colorful palette, he has something to say, and he'll probably make you think long and hard about it. 「さらざんまい」（@sarazanmai)制作中です！これから情報も解禁していきますよ。よろしくお願いします！https://t.co/GHNqeRaW0T#さらざんまい — 幾原邦彦ikuhara_kunihiko (@ikuni_noise) March 5, 2018 In his tweet, he urges fans to keep an eye on the official site and Twitter accounts.

12994|2018-03-05|21:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/moe-shop-moe-moe-ep-announcement/| News | Music | Moe Shop Announces Upcoming 'Moe Moe' EP | France-based producer Moe Shop has just announced their upcoming EP and its incredible lineup of underground Japanese collaborators. |France-based producer Moe Shop has today formally announced their upcoming EP "Moe Moe," as well as the superstar lineup of Japanese talent collaborating on it. Set to release digitally on March 15 and physically at a later date, "Moe Moe" aims to showcase the evolution of Moe Shop as they move forward into the future. Coming in at a total of six tracks, each a powerful collaboration with some of the hardest-working females in Japan's underground music scene, we can't wait to finally listen to their latest creation. Before we get into dissecting the upcoming release, let's take a look at the full tracklist and artwork below: Tracklist: 1. Magic (w/ MYLK) 3:29 2. Virtual (w/ Puniden) 3:32 3. Baby Pink (w/ YUC'e) 4:57 4. Lovesick (w/ Maisou) 2:52 5. Notice (w/ TORIENA) 3:06 6. Fantasy (w/ MONICO) 4:35 Artwork by: pepperonccini (Character) moji8fresh (Background) Without getting too ahead of myself, it'd be the understatement of the year to say that's one seriously incredible lineup. Each and every person involved in this EP plays a major role in various parts of the Japanese music scene, so having them presented in a single package is really cool. It's been confirmed that "Moe Moe" is set to play out for 22 minutes 35 seconds, and I'm sure every moment of that will be absolute bliss. Additionally, all of the songs on the album will feature Japanese vocals and lyrics courtesy of the collaborating artist. We reached out to Moe Shop ahead of the release about the creation process, and they had the following to share: The making of "Moe Moe" was something completely new to me, I've never invested myself so much into a project. This time I aimed for something much more personal & polished, and I got to work with some of my favorite artists out there. It's been a year since I started working on this EP, and looking back, I've met so many inspiring people and made so many friends, I couldn't be more grateful. At last I get to experience the satisfaction of finally sharing something so dear to me with everyone, and I'm really hoping that you will enjoy this EP as much as I do. Set to release March 15, "Moe Moe" is definitely my most anticipated release of the year. Now I can only hope there's some sort of live show that makes its way to Tokyo. If you're interested in checking out Moe Shop's music, you can find their full archive here.

I'm hoping that I can actually get away with saying that Hironobu Sakaguchi, Father of Final Fantasy will be Let's Playing his own game, because at its core, that is exactly what he's doing. Even though Hironobu Sakaguchi hasn't been directly involved with the Final Fantasy series since 2003, he's been happy to continue engaging in the chatter surrounding the fan-favorite RPG series and has made numerous guest appearances at events. This time, in conjunction with Japan's biggest gaming magazine Famitsu, he plans to conquer Final Fantasy VI in just four "Let's Play" style videos. With each episode airing on the first of the month, a new special guest will be joining Sakaguchi to commentate alongside him. In the first episode which aired yesterday, he was joined by "pixel art specialist" Kazuko Shibuya who served as a designer on Final Fantasy VI. Check out how the creator tackles his own creation in the first episode below. At the end of the broadcast, both Sakaguchi and Shibuya signed a copy of FF Dot, a newly-released artbook celebrating the classic pixel styles of the pre-VII titles in the series. It's quite a handsome tome and seems to be required reading for any mega-fans of the series. So, based on the progress you've seen in this first episode of his playthrough, do you think that he'll be able to complete the game in just three more similarly-long videos?

12985|2018-03-05|13:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/hisone-to-masotan-pv/| News | Anime | Mari Okada and Studio Bone's Latest is a Modern Tale About a Pilot Girl and Her Dragon | Oozing with artistic personality, 'Hisone to Masotan' is shaping up to be an anime not to be missed. |Even if you don't make a point to follow some of the more prolific names behind anime production, it has become nigh impossible to avoid seeing the name of one of anime's most prominent screenwriters floating around on social media. It's with good reason -- she's been amazingly active as of late and has quite a few hits under her belt already. If you've watched the likes of Toradora, Hanasaku Iroha, anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day, and Kiznaiver, then you are already acquainted with her work. Beginning on April 12 for the Spring season, you'll be able to see Mari Okada's latest -- a totally original work penned by herself and directed at Studio Bones, all supervised by Shinji Higuchi, the co-founder of Gainax and the co-director of Shin Godzilla. It's called Hisone to Masotan (Hisone and Masotan) and is about a girl in the Japan Self-Defense Force who is able to pilot a dragon. The official website has a ton of information already available, including the synopsis of the first episode in English: Hisone Amakasu tends to hurt people unconsciously, as she is too honest. Suffering in a relationship, she joined Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) as a fixed term staff and was assigned to Gifu base. One day Hisone was sent to “the 8th hangar” and there bumped into a dragon. And what is more, she was swallowed by him! The dragon is called OTF (Organic Transformed Flyer), which has been managed by JASDF since ancient times. This is how Hisone’s new phase of life as a dragon pilot begins. The anime's key visual highlights its simple and appealing style. Masotan certainly isn't your typical scaly, razor-toothed kaiju, at least not from what we've been able to see thus far: In addition to the all-star members of staff mentioned so far, Yoshiyuki Ito is in charge of bringing the noticeably down-to-earth character designs by Toshinao Aoki to life for animation. It allows for a work that will hopefully truly sign through the personality of its characters, their playful facial expressions, and through some of the beautiful-looking environments surrounding a reserved Air Self Defense Force base in Gifu prefecture, a place that just so happens to be very close to my own home.

She was the face and voice behind viral sensations such as "PonPonPon," frequently going above and beyond in pushing the conventional limits of Japanese pop music at large. Well it's a new year, and Kyary has finally emerged with the announcement of a new single, as well as an upcoming world tour; oh, and a statement that this year won't be like anything in the past. 新曲リリースとワールドツアーはじまるよ！この写真私か。笑 今年は続編じゃなく新作を作る年にします！！！！ pic.twitter.com/6adYZSQ854 — きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ (@pamyurin) 2 March 2018 Initially announced at her birthday event a short time ago, Kyary went on to share her upcoming single "Kimi no Mikata" (Your Friend) will be released April 11 in Japan. Attached to the announcement was the above image, showcasing Kyary's mature new look that perhaps hints at that new direction she mentioned. I wouldn't worry too much, however, as the aforementioned world tour will be her "THE SPOOKY OBAKEYASHIKI ~PUMPKINS STRIKE BACK~” concert that she debuted in Japan this past Halloween. Currently announced for England, Germany, and the United States, it's currently unknown if Kyary Pamyu Pamyu will be adding any additional stops to her tour. Inspired by the likeness of Japanese haunted houses, "THE SPOOKY OBAKEYASHIKI ~PUMPKINS STRIKE BACK~" brings on a terrifyingly cute ensemble to join Kyary on the stage.

For those in Japan, it acts as somewhat of a recap of the year that was in music; but for outsiders, it's an incredible opportunity to glance into what's truly going on in this ever-changing musical landscape. There are 27 categories with awards up for grabs, but perhaps most importantly is the coveted "Song of the Year" award. It's with great excitement that I can share that the winner of this award for 2017 was DAOKO and Kenshi Yonezu for their collaborative song "Uchiage Hanabi." When it was initially announced that SHAFT's 2017 animated film "Fireworks, Should We See it from the Side or the Bottom?" would be calling on the talents of both artists to craft the movie's theme song, I couldn't be more excited. This was, of course, two of my favorite musicians we were talking about, and the end result was nothing short of perfection in my eyes. It's clear now that I wasn't the only one that thought that either, though I'm sure that was obvious for quite some time. That wasn't where things stopped for the two artists during the show either, with each of them netting an additional award in the field of "Best Male Artist" (Kenshi Yonezu) and "Best Breakthrough Artist" (DAOKO). Neither of those things is undeserved either, with both artists making the most of the year that was and pushing out some of the best Japanese music in quite some time. Just the other day Kenshi Yonezu pushed out his latest single, "Lemon," which is receiving mass-popularity, not to any surprise. While these two artists have most definitely made the most of the year 2017, it's absolutely worth checking out some of the other incredible talents on the awards website. If this year can be as great as the last, then I've most definitely got something incredible ahead of me. |daoko, Uchiage Hanabi, space shower, Song of the Year Japan, Fireworks, Should We See It From the Side or the Bottom?

Set to begin screening across Japan from July 20, Mamoru Hosoda's latest film tells the story of Kun and his time-traveling younger sister who has traveled back from the future kicking off this fantasy-filled adventure. Now only one question remains; why did Mirai travel back in time? Given this is the latest work of legendary director Mamoru Hosoda, there's not a doubt in my mind this film is going to be something great. Having graced the industry with a number of fourth-wall-breaking films including "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time," "Summer Wars," and "The Boy and The Beast," the director certainly has the means to pull off such an ambitious project. It's also been announced the film will open across 57 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. I'm definitely excited to see this film, especially following the spectacle that was "The Boy and The Beast" which I had the opportunity to catch opening day. With just over four months to wait, I've got plenty of time to revisit any number of the creator's classics, something I'm more than happy to give my time to.

In this week's issue of Shonen Jump, it was revealed that the series will be collaborating with Animate, one of Japan's largest anime and manga retailers, to bring fans a themed café. The café will run from April 17 to May 13 in their special Ikebukuro and Nagoya Animate Café stores. Exclusive goods will be up for grabs, including keychains and boxes for candy, but what is more exciting is that this seems to be merely the first in a series of "Hunter x Hunter" cafés. As the official website suggests, this first café will be themed around the Phantom Troupe, yet the second will be themed around the Greed Island arc. The Phantom Troupe will once more return for the third, but it will end with the infamous Chimera Ant arc. It is unclear when these additional cafés will take place - they could be one after each other, but considering how much time this would take up of the café’s schedule, this seems unlikely. Furthermore, the return of "Hunter x Hunter" to the pages of Jump has brought forth a new wave of merchandise. Several new badges and charms have been announced, as well as some more high-end acrylic stands and bracelets. I'm sure that more is on the way as well, to take advantage of the Jump Fair taking placing in Animate stores across Japan very soon. Last time the series returned in 2017 for 10 weeks, there was no accompanying marketing push. It seems that the Jump marketing team are fairly sure that the series will be sticking around for longer than last time, which was in total a 10 week run during 2017. The series’ latest chapters have been hovering around the middle of the Jump weekly chapter rankings, suggesting somewhat lukewarm reactions from fans. This most likely stems from the slow pacing of the current arc, which perhaps isn't pulling in an audience desperate for progression. Nevertheless, this doesn't seem to be bothering the Shonen Jump staff too much. Which makes me wonder if there is something they know that we don't? It'd be wonderful news to hear that author Togashi really has recovered from his back pain once and for all if something like that was plausible. Maybe he’s serious about advancing the story this time. Even so, only time will tell. |Hunter x Hunter, hxh, Hunter x Hunter Cafe, hxh cafe, shonen jump cafe, Shonen Jump

When Porter Robinson first announced his side-project through the release of the rapid-fire "EON BREAK" late last year, it not only ushered in a mainstream appeal to a genre previously ignored by the masses, but it also opened the floodgates for Porter to share a number of emotions unable to be expressed in any other way. That same feeling has returned once more in Virtual Self's latest '00 internet-tinged music video for "Ghost Voices." Let's just get this out of the way -- I'm absolutely in love with this music video. From its eerily Shin Megami Tensei-esque vibe, all the way to the clear callbacks to games such as beatmania IIDX and Dance Dance Revolution, it strikes just about every right chord. The initial boot up sequence in the music video rips listeners into the digital world, questioning their every move as both Pathselector and technic_angel whisk them away on a journey into ones e-lifestyle. What comes next for Virtual Self and the characters that it finds itself built upon remains a mystery, but you can bet I'll be following it every step of the way. |Virtual Self, Ghost Voices, porter robinson, Virtual Self Music Video

That's twelve long and enduring days until I can throw my money at whatever poor cashier has to serve me, as I gush over the latest anime collaboration from Uniqlo sister brand GU. Set to release on March 13 here in Japan, I've been blown away by just how much justice GU is doing to the sleekness of the Evangelion series. From start to finish, this entire collection rules. The best part? The most expensive item in the collection comes in at a total of 3,990 yen, which is at least an entire 1,500 yen more expensive than anything else. There's not a single piece in the collection short of perhaps the film-branded sweatshirts that don't feel entirely inspired, offering a sleekness unrivaled in functionality and simplicity. Seriously, this whole collection is seeming really, really good. It truly feels like now more than ever before there's a clear crossover between the worlds of anime and fashion. I've said this before, and chances are I'll say it again sometime in the future, but it really does feel like we're at a perfect balance right now where you can express what you love without needing to wear an all-over print of Asuka or Rei, and that's perfectly okay with me. If you're interested in picking up the collection and are in Japan, pre-orders will go online between 5:00 am and 6:00 am (JST) on March 12. Orders can be made via the official online store for GU which can be found here, or made in-store at a physical location. |Evangelion, Evangelion Fashion, GU, Anime Fashion, Anime Clothing, Eva, Eva Fashion, Khara

Or, well, that was the plan at least. For those players who quickly raced to download the game to storm through the demo in North America, they might have noticed something was a little... off. Where the demo was simply meant to cut off and finish, the game seemingly continued playing, even offering trophies for players hard work. It didn't take long before SEGA noticed this somewhat major error and raced to take it down from the North American PlayStation Store. We’re looking into the nature of the issue. Thank you for your patience. 2/2 — SEGA (@SEGA) 27 February 2018 While it appears the correct game was uploaded to both the European and Australian stores, it's unclear when the North American version will be available again. With the full game expected to release April 17, however, we can't imagine it'll be too far away. Until then, it's definitely worth catching up on a bit of "Yakuza" history via the series' official website.|Yakuza 6, Sega, Free Yakuza 6, Playstation

It was a dancefloor-ready heater that represented a side of m-flo seemingly untouched since LISA departed the group 15 years prior, and we were 200% all for it. Well now m-flo is back once more, this time with a slowed down ballad in the form of "never," the theme song for the upcoming live-action film "Last Winter, We Parted." Uploaded to the m-flo YouTube channel early Thursday morning, "never" comes straight from the group's upcoming EP release "the tripod e.p. 2" which is set to release March 7 in Japan. The EP will feature three new original songs, as well as a remix of "prism" by France-based DJ and producer Canblaster. It's an exciting time to be an m-flo fan, and we're definitely excited to see where they continue going from here. The upcoming Warner Bros. Japan live-action film "Last Winter, We Parted" prominently features Sandaime J Soul Brothers and Exile member Takanori Iwata, otherwise known as Gun-chan. Set to release in Japan on March 10, the film called on the talents of the newly reformed m-flo after over 15 years apart from LISA. Those interested in checking it out when it screens here in Japan can visit the official website.

12969|2018-03-01|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-30-exhibition/| News | Anime , Manga | 30 Years of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Honored With New Exhibition | In celebration of the 30th anniversary of Hirohiko Araki's massively-influential JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series, Tokyo is being graced with a large-scale exhibition. |Ever since Jojo's Bizarre Adventure began serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump in 1986 with the game-changing first entry into the long-running series, "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood," the franchise has occupied a special place in the weekly magazine, as well an important place in Japanese pop culture industry at large. With the wacky sensibilities that make it universally entertaining, coupled with the endless creativity that disregards any and all conventions of the shonen genre, "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure" has endured a wide-number of changes throughout the years, and its incredible legacy is now being honored with a new exhibition. Titled "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Ripples of Adventure," the exhibition will feature 30 years of JoJo's art, starting from the original "Phantom Blood" series all the way to the latest entry, "Jojolion." It'd be a fair assumption that the exhibition will feature a mixture of new art, as well as art previously displayed in the 2012 and 2017 exhibitions held in the Mori Art Museum and Sendai respectively. The announcement for the exhibition came with a handwritten letter from Hirohiko Araki himself, who remarked that although "It is a real honor to have 30 years of Jojo works displayed in such a prestigious place... that also makes me feel very nervous." One can hardly blame Araki, as the new exhibition will be held at the National Art Center Tokyo in Roppongi Hills, one of the most prestigious art galleries in the country. Very few mangaka have had the opportunity to display their works at all, let alone at such a prestigious venue, which is merely another testament to the enduring cultural influence of the JoJo series. Araki also commented that "In this exhibition, we conceived to let you meet with the characters and their 'guardian spirits' [stands] in the same era, at the same time". This may suggest that the exhibition will be themed around certain characters in order to place an emphasis on them, as well as that the exhibition may showcase characters from all of the parts equally. This, in particular, stands out following the 2017 exhibition which focused on the series' fourth part, "Diamond is Unbreakable." In any case, the exhibition is tentatively scheduled to open in summer 2018, so keep an eye on the official website or Twitter for more information. |JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Hirohiko Araki, JoJo Exhibition, JoJo's 30th Anniversary

That's where the recently launched Japan Anime Music Lab, or JAM Lab for short, comes into play. The joint effort between industry leaders such as Avex Entertainment, SACRA Music, Lantis, and more connects organizers to top-ranking Anisong artists such as LiSA, JAM Project, ClariS, GARNiDELiA, and more. Events such as Anisong World Matsuri are prime examples of the demands of international fans, with lines wrapping around the block at this year's Anime Expo event. It's hoped that through this music hub, international audiences and professionals will be able to keep up to date with the current trending artists and news within the anisong industry. In turn, this should help foster and develop the careers of Japanese musicians internationally, something that wasn't necessarily being done proficiently in the past. It truly is my hope that through the JAM Lab the West can be better connected and informed about the Japanese anisong industry and creators, and while we likely won't see the results of the project for some time, it's certainly a start.

Billing herself as a "super AI," or artificial intelligence (hence her own name), she set out to offer a variety of content on her channel, including vlogs and gaming Let's Plays. While I do believe it's clear that Kizuna Ai is not actually a pure AI or a "bot" of the sort, her formula of blending equal parts cute, comedy, and even encouragement made her an instant standout amongst the legions of human YouTubers out there. Now that she's had plenty of success on YouTube and with corporate sponsorships and crossovers, it seems time that she makes the jump off of the platform that helped her gain so much success. It's time to welcome Virtual Satellite TV Star(?) Kizuna Ai! Beginning April 6, Kizuna Ai will star in a show on BSNi Tele, a satellite channel in Japan. "Kizuna Ai no BEAT Scramble" will have the host introducing hot topics in the worlds of anime, games, music and online culture. Each episode will last a half hour, and will feature all of the trademark Kizuna Ai-isms that fans have come to love. In the announcement, Kizuna Ai has given fans a personal message: Hai domo! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai desu! Usually, I've been uploading all of my videos on YouTube, but what's this?! I'll be starring in a TV show this April? It's true! This will be my first time on TV, but I plan to give it my best shot, so please come watch and give me your support! If you haven't had a chance to check out her content on YouTube yet, I'd recommend starting with some of her Let's Plays! You can watch her play and commentate Super Mario Odyssey, Players Unknown Battlegrounds, Limbo, and so much more. I promise, you'll be hooked after one video. Her normal, vlog-focused channel is here, and her gaming channel is right here.|Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai, Kizuna Ai no BEAT Scramble

(Known as Yotsuba to! in Japan) is set to receive 14th volume on April 28. |Announced by Kadokawa earlier today, Kiyohiko Azuma's infectiously-adorable "Yotsuba&!" (released as Yotsuba to! in Japan) will be receiving a 14th volume which is set to release on April 28. Well over two years since the 13th volume shipped in Japan, the manga series which follows the everyday life of young Yotsuba is finally getting expanded. When it comes to the story of "Yotsuba&!," I honestly couldn't say how many times I've read it. The series exists as both a powerful tool for studying the Japanese language due to its simple literary style, as well as a legitimately great manga series that constantly holds its value. There are over 10 million copies that have been sold in Japan alone, and that number continues to grow globally with Yen Press publishing the series in North America. It's an exciting time to be a fan of "Yotsuba&!," and I can't wait to see what the 14th volume brings to the table. Until then, it's definitely worth re-reading the earlier volumes, all of which can be found via Yen Press.|Yotsuba&!, Yotsuba to!, Kiyohiko Azuma

Best known for his work on legendary manga series such as "Oyasumi Punpun," "Solaris," and most recently, "Dead Dead Demon's De De De De Destruction," there's a lot of reasons to be excited. This certainly isn't small news, and it goes without saying that I'm quite the fan of his creations. Attending in the promotion of the North American release of "Dead Dead Demon's De De De De Destruction" from Viz Media, fans will be able to interact during a live interview session, autograph sessions, and a live illustration session. I'm not going to tell you to go, but you absolutely need to be there. I've been excited for an English-language release of the manga series for quite some time, and can't wait to be able to discuss with a new wave of fans about the beauty of it. Set to take place during May 12 - 13, you'll definitely want to be there for this potential once in a lifetime opportunity. Perhaps the manga creator I'd most like the opportunity to sit down and chat with, I'll definitely have to keep striving for that face-to-face chat time.

12950|2018-02-27|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/kenshi-yonezu-lemon-unnatural/| News | N/A | Kenshi Yonezu Shares Latest Music Video For 'Lemon' | Kenshi Yonezu is back in the music video for his latest single, 'Lemon,' which is acting as the theme song for Japanese upcoming television drama 'Unnatural.' |Within the Japanese music scene, there is perhaps no name better known than Kenshi Yonezu, perhaps best known internationally for his work on the "My Hero Academia" opening theme "Peace Sign." He's been consistently on repeat on just about every Japanese music channel for quite some time now, and that trend is certainly showing no signs of letting up. That statement is especially true if his latest single "Lemon" and its accompanying music video are anything to go by. Generating an unheard of 750,000+ views in under 12 hours on his latest music video release, while also simultaneously taking the #1 trending spot on YouTube Japan, Kenshi Yonezu is a name you'll be hearing for quite a bit longer. His latest single, "Lemon," has been acting as the theme song for TBS television drama "Unnatural," which is entering its 8th episode here in Japan. Detailed alongside the music video release was an upcoming physical single release for "Lemon" which is also set to contain two additional songs, "Cranberry & Pancake" and "Paper Flower." Ever since I first started digging into Kenshi Yonezu's music, it's always blown me away that this is the same musician who would define my early Vocaloid days with songs under his alternative alias Hachi such as "Matryoshka," "Donut Hole," and "Panda Hero." Most recently the musician would go on to release "DUNE," the theme song to the 2017 Magical Mirai event under the Hachi alias. There's something almost off-putting about one of Japan's biggest musicians having gotten their start with Vocaloid software, but it's really cool at the same time. It's no surprise that, much like his other works, "Lemon" is an enjoyable listen from start to finish. With 2018 just kicking off, I really can't wait to see what Kenshi Yonezu continues to bring to the table. Set to release March 14 in Japan, you'll be able to pick up "Lemon" in-store and digitally.

12944|2018-02-26|18:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/pop-team-epic-ac-bu-sushi-tabetai/| News | Anime , Manga , Music | Before 'Pop Team Epic' AC部 Gifted Us the 'Sushi Tabetai' MV | Even before their involvement in 'Pop Team Epic,' AC部 (AC-Bu) was offering us incredible music video works such as Orange Range's 'Sushi Tabetai.' |Before they were gracing our television screens for a fraction of 11 minutes at a time, before the hilarious "Bob Epic Team," and before "Hellshake Yano," animation trio AC部 (AC-Bu) were animating some really, really great music videos. From the moment I set my eyes on the "Bob Team Epic" skit, I knew I had seen that somewhere before, but it wasn't until a few weeks later that it dawned on me. "I want to eat sushi!," that wasn't something I thought to myself, rather, it was the direct translation of ORANGE RANGE's hyper-infectious MV "Sushi Tabetai." For those of you who don't know the name ORANGE RANGE, you almost definitely know their work on the original "Bleach" opening theme, "Asterisk." When the song originally released in 2005, the group were on top of the Japanese charts for all of March. Things were really getting wild for them, and then 10 years later, something different happened. On September 18, 2016, the world was blessed with the music video for ORANGE RANGE's latest, less-serious, "Sushi Tabetai," an eye-opening tribute to Japan's most recognized snack. It was as polarizing as it was beautiful, standing in complete parallel to almost every song on the group's 10th studio album "TEN." Perhaps most iconic, however, was the choice to allow AC部 creative freedom as the music video animators. In stark contrast to almost everything else released by the group, the song rapidly went on to become a cult classic amongst a strange audience of viewers. In the same way that the skits of "Bob Epic Team" couldn't be pulled off without AC部's animation style, the comedic effect of this song wouldn't hit nearly as hard without the music video, and that's part of what makes it so great. While the music video isn't directly credited to AC部 in either the description or the upload, it doesn't take too much searching to find confirmation. Besides, if this kind of content can come from the mind of anyone other than AC部's three members, we'd truly be living in a terrifying world. I'm totally infatuated with the works of the trio, and I can't wait to see where they go following on from "Pop Team Epic." Until that time, however, all I have to say is don't stop the music, don't stop the sushi. |Pop Team Epic, AC部, Sushi Tabetai, AC-Bun, Orange Range

Considered by many to be a timeless classic of its genre, "In This Corner of the World" has been so successful in Japan that cinema screenings are still taking place daily, despite the film opening back in November 2016 with over 2 million tickets sold domestically. This is a definitive win for Western anime fans, and I can't urge people enough to give it a watch. Written and directed by Sunao Katabuchi, with production by GENCO and MAPPA, it's pretty clear why people are so excited about this film. Set to be available on Netflix for people within Canada, North America, and Japan, the streaming service has also shared that "some countries and territories" will be receiving the film additionally. The film's synopsis can be found below: In This Corner of the World tells the story of the adolescent Suzu, who in 1944 moves to the small town of Kure in Hiroshima to live with her husband’s family. Suzu’s life is thrown into chaos when her town is bombed during World War II. Her perseverance and courage, however, underpin this heart-warming and inspirational tale of the everyday challenges faced by the Japanese in the midst of a violent, war-torn country. It's definitely exciting to see that such a major property will be available via Netflix, and I can't wait to see more people talking about the anime film. |In This Corner of the World, Netflix, Netflix Anime, Sunao Katabuchi, Mappa
12942|2018-02-26|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/crunchyroll-anime-awards-results/| News | Anime , Manga | Crunchyroll Anime Award Winners Announced | Crunchyroll's annual Anime Awards has finally come to an end, ushering in this year's most popular anime and characters across a number of categories. |We're already well into 2018, and we're possibly having one of the best years for anime in quite some time. With that being said, last year was most definitely filled with a number of gems that deserve to be recognized in a number of ways -- one of which is the annual Crunchyroll Anime Awards ceremony. The awards ceremony is split up into 17 different categories, with each one representing a different part of 2017's anime offerings. From categories like "Best Hero," all the way to the flavorings of "Best Girl," it's an important annual event where anime fans across the globe can have their voice heard. Well, the results have officially rolled back in and we now know just who and what the people want to see more of -- and the results are just about at a landslide. Before getting into that, however, let's take a look at just who made the cut in the 2018 Crunchyroll Anime Awards: Anime of the Year: Made in Abyss // Studio - Kinema Citrus Best Girl: Ochako Uraraka // My Hero Academia // Studio - BONES Best Boy: Shoto Todoroki // My Hero Academia // Studio - BONES Best Manga: My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness // Publisher - Seven Seas Entertainment Best Hero: Izuku "Deku" Midoriya // My Hero Academia // Studio - BONES Best Villain: Stain // My Hero Academia // Studio - BONES Best Action: My Hero Academia Season 2 // Studio - BONES Best Drama: The Ancient Magus' Bride // Studio - Wit Studio Best Comedy: Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid // Studio - Kyoto Animation Best Slice of Life: Girls' Last Tour // Studio - White Fox Best Continuing Series: March Comes In Like A Lion // Studio - SHAFT Best Opening: Kenshi Yonezu - Peace Sign // My Hero Academia Season 2 // Studio - BONES Best Ending: Chorogonzu - Ishukan Communication // Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid // Studio - Kyoto Animation Best Animation: My Hero Academia Season 2 // Studio - BONES Best Score: Made in Abyss // Studio - Kinema Citrus Best Film: your name. // Studio - CoMix Wave Films Best CGI: Land of the Lustrous // Studio - ORANGE Now I'm no expert, but I'd have to say that Studio BONES' second season of "My Hero Academia" might have been pretty popular in the West. But hey, that's just my guess. Taking out almost half of the awards available, including the likes of "Best Animation," Studio BONES crafted something incredible in the show's second season, and it really goes to show. That being said, we can't not talk about the incredible "Made in Abyss," a show not even available on the Crunchyroll platform, yet one that received such an outcry of support from the community at large. Analyzing the whole thing, it's no surprise that "My Hero Academia" swept the house. It's worth noting too that the "Anime of the Year" category wasn't actually open to the public, but was conducted by a panel of judges from across the Western industry. It's likely because of this that "Made in the Abyss" would rightfully stand to take the award; though it's likely the result would have differed in a public-voting setting. Once again, the event went on to bring the community together to cast their votes, and we can only hope to see this happen again next year. If you're interested in checking out a little more information about the awards process, it's worth checking out Crunchyroll's homepage, where they share a few of those details. Until next year though, let's enjoy everything that 2018 has to offer in the realm of anime!|Crunchyroll Anime Awards, Crunchyroll, Anime Awards, My Hero Academia
12936|2018-02-26|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/tomoki-kyoda-reddit-ama-recap/| News | Anime | Looking Back at the Tomoki Kyoda /r/anime AMA | We take a look back at the incredible /r/anime AMA with Eureka Seven director Tomoki Kyoda that took place over the weekend live from Studio BONES. |This last weekend has been an absolute riot for the OTAQUEST staff as we headed off to the Studio BONES offices to conduct our live AMA session with Eureka Seven director Tomoki Kyoda on /r/anime. The community came out in masses to celebrate the veteran creator's works, as well as ask a number of hard-hitting questions involving his favorite pizza toppings. Over a hundred questions were asked, and we all worked our hardest to answer as many of them as possible -- but of course, we've got a few favorites of our own. Let's take a look back at some of those questions, as we continue to celebrate the incredible work of Tomoki Kyoda. Comment from discussion My name is Tomoki Kyoda, the director of Eureka Seven and storyboard artist of Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone, AMA! [Live from Studio BONES]. When looking over Tomoki Kyoda's favorites, it's pretty easy to see that great work is inspired by equally great work. In particular, my eyes definitely lit up with the mention of Hayao Miyazaki's original Lupin the Third anime series, something I personally hold in a very high place. Of all the things that were said during the interview, however, this was absolutely the most insane. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the most full-circle thing that's ever happened; Tomoki Kyoda getting into the anime industry because of a Watanabe Shinichiro interview about techno music in anime written by the very same Dai Sato that he would go on to create Eureka Seven alongside. Comment from discussion My name is Tomoki Kyoda, the director of Eureka Seven and storyboard artist of Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone, AMA! [Live from Studio BONES]. While Eureka Seven is definitely one of the works that Tomoki Kyoda is most noted for, his incredible role in the creation of Evangelion 1.0 is often a point of discussion amongst fans. It was interesting to hear his take on working on the film, and equally interesting that if offered to do it in similar fashion again he'd turn it down. Comment from discussion My name is Tomoki Kyoda, the director of Eureka Seven and storyboard artist of Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone, AMA! [Live from Studio BONES]. One of my absolute favorite questions from the AMA, it was exciting to see the way that Tomoki Kyoda lit up while explaining the process. In particular, there was a distinct chuckle let out by everyone in the room as he explained the concept of how difficult re-runs of the show can be due to the existence of this scene and the complicated way in which it was originally aired. Comment from discussion My name is Tomoki Kyoda, the director of Eureka Seven and storyboard artist of Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone, AMA! [Live from Studio BONES]. This answer, in particular, was definitely one of the more expected ones, though it's a really cool piece of trivia that Tomoki Kyoda had purchased a Roland TB-303 (the quintessential acid sound synthesizer) from Denki Groove for as low as $50 when they're now easily worth $2,000 or more. The envy in my eyes might have been a little apparent at the moment he mentioned that detail. It's a shame he had to stop collecting them though, it's definitely a collection I'd love to see with my own eyes. Comment from discussion My name is Tomoki Kyoda, the director of Eureka Seven and storyboard artist of Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone, AMA! [Live from Studio BONES]. This answer, in particular, struck a few chords with everyone in the room. The idea of giving back to that which gives you so much is something that resonates a lot amongst our team, and it was definitely motivating in a whole lot of ways to hear those words uttered by Tomoki Kyoda in regards to the creation of Eureka Seven. Comment from discussion My name is Tomoki Kyoda, the director of Eureka Seven and storyboard artist of Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone, AMA! [Live from Studio BONES]. As a bit of trivia about this one, when we were initially talking about this there was the previous discussion of how most of his ideas for anime usually come from casual conversations. Following that Tomoki Kyoda went on to say that he's been very into Chicago Soul music as of late. Then when he uttered that he'd love to create a Yakuza-themed series, we chimed in and mentioned infusing Chicago Soul with it, and the room was alight with ideas. It was definitely an exciting place to be. While this is only a small sample of some of the incredible questions from the community, there's definitely a whole lot of other information and details to explore throughout the thread. It was more than exciting to be in the Studio BONES offices, and we couldn't be more happy with the outcome. If you're interested in checking out the original posting, be sure to head over to the /r/anime thread, here. You can expect to see a number of AMA sessions from us in the near future, as well as our exclusive interview which is set to come out soon.

Your mission to complete it is simple: 'Destroy Takeshobo.' |In a trend that I really hope doesn't go away anytime soon, some of anime's hottest properties are getting live games -- escape rooms, puzzle quests; all experiences that let you and some partners use both your head and your body to assist the characters from your favorite stories. With this latest "adventure," however, I'm not so sure that you and your buddies will actually be accomplishing anything to make you feel especially good about yourselves. That is unless you too have the same sort of personal vendetta against Japanese mega-publishing corporation Takeshobo. In a new live-puzzle game coming to Tokyo starting March 3, your mission is simple: destroy Takeshobo. Pop Team Epic x Asobi Factory: You Must Destroy Takeshobo The story goes something like this -- you're a rookie detective assigned to Tokyo's Jinbocho district. You must tackle 4 mysterious cases before facing the final enemy: Takeshobo itself. The experience requires you to purchase kits with all the materials you'll need to solve 5 mysteries: The Disappearance of a Female College Student Confronting the Jinbocho Color Gangs The Freezing of 'Complain About Things on the Net' Man The Pop Team Epic Sales Numbers Incident You Must Destroy Takeshobo You'll be able to purchase the kits at various locations around Jinbocho, including the Asobi Factory building. The company says that you'll need anywhere between 3-5 hours to solve all the mysteries and that you will also need to utilize the LINE messaging service to complete the experience. You can find all the details you need, including Asobi Factory's address, as well as the days and locations where you can purchase the kits here.

From their comprehensive ability to turn an ordinary moment into a hyperactive dreamscape, all the way to their in-your-face visual aesthetic, they're the embodiment of Japan's emerging underground idol scene. That's why when news broke that Los Angeles-based netlabel Attack the Music would be distributing their first digital album internationally, I couldn't be more excited. <a href="http://shop.attackthemusic.com/album/happy-kuru-kuru">Happy Kuru Kuru by Happy Kuru Kuru</a> If you're yet to hear any of the tracks on Happy Kuru Kuru's self-titled digital album, you're absolutely missing out. From the high-paced rhythm of "Magical Girl," all the way to the hard-hitting "Kuru Kuru Fantasy," the release screams perfection all over. With each of the group's tracks produced by fellow Tokyo-based musician Yunomi, while also featuring artwork by the incredible Kiato, Happy Kuru Kuru really does feel like the everything I truly enjoy wrapped into one incredible package. Getting their start in the underground idol scene just two years ago in 2016, it's exciting to see the rapid growth of the duo. I've been a long time fan of both Yunomi and Kiato's works, and to see that they were once again working together with the Happy Kuro Kuro duo was welcome news to my ears. It'll be exciting to see what the future brings for both Happy Kuru Kuru and Attack the Music, and we can't wait to see where they go from here. If you're interested in picking up a digital copy of the album, "Happy Kuru Kuru" is available via Attack the Music's official Bandcamp.

The design is simple in concept, featuring both Popuko and Pipimi illustrated with Denki Groove member features superimposed on top. Honestly, it doesn't seem too far-fetched from something you'd actually see in the original group, so I'm definitely all for it: The duo, who is perhaps most recently noted internationally for their work on the DEVILMAN crybaby soundtrack, has often been paired up with the Pop Team Epic series over here in Japan by fans on social media sites like Twitter. This recognition even held enough weight that series producer Kotaro Sudo went on to say that in a live-action version of the show, he'd definitely want to bring on Denki Groove. The shirts are going to be available in a super small quantity, so if you're interested in getting your hands on one of them you'll need to head over to one of the groups "Kracken Hawk" live shows in both Tokyo and Osaka. The Osaka live show is set to happen on March 16 at Zepp Namba, with the Tokyo live show happening a day later at Zepp Tokyo. Further information on the merchandise can be found on the official website for the musical duo. Image: Denki Groove, King Records|Pop Team Epic, denki groove

This release not only marks the first Western release in their classic Shining franchise in over a decade, but also is the widest release (in regards to platforms) in the history of the series with ports slated on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. For those unfamiliar with the Shining series, it originally debuted on the Sega Genesis as Shining Force, going on to receive entries on several consoles over the years. The original games were tactical RPGs, eventually evolving to a more real-time action battle system. New to Shining Resonance Refrain is a music-themed mechanic called the "B.A.N.D." system which Sega explains: Dragoneers wield Armonics, ancient weapon-instruments, in order to perform mystical and powerful Rune Songs. Once you build enough BPM (Battle Performance Mana), your party will be able to perform a session through the B.A.N.D. system. Depending on which song you play and which character you set at the center, your party will be able to indulge in various beneficial effects. Certain characters may even perform the song in a special costume!​ This new release of the title will feature dual audio with English and Japanese language tracks available, something that fans tend to clamor for in Western releases of Japanese titles. It will also include all DLC from the original release of Shining Resonance, as well as a new "Refrain Mode" that includes the Imperial Princess Excella and Dragonslayer Jinas as playable characters! It was also announced that players who pre-order and purchase the physical launch edition of the game (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch only) will receive special edition packaging with a metal slipcase that features character artwork of Excella, Sonia, and Kirika. More information on the game can be found at the official website, and you can tune into Sega's official twitch channel this Friday (2/23) at noon PST to catch a first look at the localized version of the game! Shining Resonance Refrain will be released this summer on PlayStation 4, XBox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC for $49.99 USD / $64.99 CAD.|Shining Resonance Refrain, Shining Resonance, Sega, RPG, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, Shining Resonance Refrain Western Release, Shining Resonance Refrain English

Paramount Pictures are bringing Sonic the Hedgehog to cinemas on November 15, 2019, it's today been revealed. The upcoming film is set to utilize both live action and CGI to aid in bringing the fastest hedgehog around to life. The film is set to be directed by Jeff Fowler, a creative making their directorial debut with the movie. Not sold on the film just yet? What if I told you that producing the film is Fast and the Furious producer Neal H. Moritz, and that it's also being executive produced by Deadpool director Tim Miller? You know what, maybe this could be alright. Executive producing the film alongside Tim Miller will be Toby Ascher, with Dmitri Johnson and Dan Jevons acting as co-producers. Right now not much is known about the upcoming film apart from the approximate release date and staff. What we can say, however, is that we'll definitely be keeping an eye on this film with cautious optimism. I mean, after all, isn't it about time Sonic is given even a little bit of justice in the industry? We'll just have to wait until November 2019 to find out.

A full idol unit of course! The five-member group brought huge amounts of charm to Kemono Friends when it aired last Winter season, as they, of course, lent their talents to the show's infectiously catching opening theme, "Welcome to Japari Park." Throughout the anime, we got just a small taste of each individual member's personalities and even heard a full-length song with "Oozora Dreamer" in episode 8 of the show where they made their on-stage debut. We're incredibly excited now to detail that Penguin Performance Project, or "PPP" for short, are making their record debut with an album titled "PPP in the Sky"! Quite appropriately, the album is dropping on April 25, which just so happens to be World Penguin Day. Let's meet the members, shall we? Beginning from the top left, we have Iwabi, a Rockhopper Penguin voiced by Aina Aiba. To the right of her in the photo is Koutei, and Emperor Penguin brought to life by Ruka Nemoto. At the bottom left is Humboldt Penguin Hululu, voiced by Ikuko Chikuta. To the right of her Gen, the Gentoo Penguin! She's voiced by Kyouka Tamura. Finally, we have Princess the Royal Penguin, played by Mikoi Sasaki. The CD jacket for the upcoming release features all of the PPP members aboard one tiny airborne object. The CD has a number of special promotions surrounding its release. Seen above are some goods featuring the handwriting from a random unit member. You'll be able to receive one of these "PPP Platinum Tickets" if you preorder the CD from any animate shop in Japan. There will also be a first run edition of the CD which will include a bonus disc featuring a solo version of "Welcome to Japari Park" by each unit member. It will also include an admission ticket to a meet and greet event, the date of which will be announced in the future. Finally, here are all the details you need. ●PPP in the Sky Price:￥3,300+ tax Tracklist: Oozora Dreamer/ PPP Welcome to Japari Park（PPP ver.） / PPP First Penguin / PPP Our Story / PPP New Song 1/ PPP New Song 2/ PPP New Song / Royal Penguin New Song / Emperor Penguin New Song / Gentoo Penguin New Song / Rockhopper Penguin New Song / Humboldt Penguin The CD will have an April 25 (World Penguin Day!) release in stores, with a same-day release for iTunes and other online music streaming services.

You better watch out, because Dr. Slump's very own Arale is dashing into the world of Nendoroid at speeds of up to 500 miles an hour to commemorate the 900th Nendoroid release from Good Smile Company. That's no small number, which is why it makes perfect sense for them to call on a character with a personality larger than life itself. With this many Nendoroids under their belt, Good Smile Company are no strangers to making a quality product, and Arale Norimaki is no exception. I mean, just take a minute to stop and look at how adorable this is: Everything about this Arale is picture perfect, from the signature hat and glasses all the way to the overalls and gloves. It's been a while since I seriously collected Nendoroid, but maybe that needs to change. This little friend is too powerful to ignore, and she even brought along the "Ncha!" cannon to prove it. Speaking of which, there's a super large number of bonus accessories with the Nendoroid, which makes sense given the special occasion. This seriously adorable rendition of Arale is going to have you digging for about 4,630 yen and is currently available for pre-order via the Good Smile Company website. Set to release in August 2018, we'll definitely have to get our hands on one for the office. I mean, who doesn't want a guardian android mischievously watching over them as they work?

This is absolutely incredible news, especially as a long-time fan of the series. It'd be an understatement to say that the musical legacy held by the Lupin the Third franchise has been extremely important formative for my own musical taste, and I can't wait to see what Part 5 brings to the table in it's ending theme "Seine no Kaze ni." TVアニメ『ルパン三世 PART5』のエンディングテーマを峰不二子役の声優、沢城みゆきが歌唱することが決定致しました！大野雄二の約180曲の新楽曲とともに、沢城みゆきが唄うエンディングテーマ「セーヌの風に…（Adieu） feat. 沢城みゆき」にもご注目ください！#ルパン5 #Lupin5 pic.twitter.com/TGWpfPoX2r — TVアニメ『ルパン三世 PART5』公式 (@Lupin_Pt5) 20 February 2018 For those of you who were a fan of 2015's incredible Lupin the Third: Part 4, you're definitely in luck. It's been announced that series director Yuichiro Yano will be returning once more to handle Lupin the Third's fifth mainline entry. Additionally, handling character design will be Hisao Yokobori, while Ichiro Okouchi is set to handle scriptwriting. The fifth mainline entry into the series is set to begin airing April 2018 in Japan, telling the story of Lupin in a modern-day French setting. Because of this choice of setting, we're also likely to see a lot of 'internet-age' themes covered, with the concept of hacking and online scams being easy targets. I've actually been chuckling to myself for the last 20 minutes just thinking about the concept of Lupin putting his life on the line to heist bitcoin, only for the market to crash and the digital currency basically loses all value as he manages to wrap everything up. Being a massive fan of the Lupin the Third franchise as a whole, I couldn't possibly be any more ecstatic for the upcoming anime series. I wrote at length in the past about the joys of the series, even if I definitely wasn't the first person to get into the show. Since then, I don't think there's been any other franchise I've consumed more so than the Lupin the Third property, with albums such as Punch the Monkey on regular repeat. You can definitely expect to hear from me when Part 5 finally releases in April. For further information, be sure to check out the official website for the upcoming series and get ready for the next big heist!

Now, we have an explanation for the silence; he was working on one of the most confusing musical collaborations we've seen in a very, very long time. His new track, "Vegetable," featuring idol group Momoiro Clover Z was dropped on YouTube in an almost silent manner today. The track follows a similar formula to his previous "hit," PPAP, in that it's a very simple and repetitive song with some silly choreography attached. Adding to the bewildering nature of the release, the idol group (recently reduced to four members) is credited as Momoclo-chan Z on the single. There are more questions to ask, but rather than ramble on about my confusion, maybe we should just let you watch the video for yourself: Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not the first time a reputable pop act has collaborated like this on a track with a comedian. My immediate thought when hearing about this was the 2002 collaboration (I'm dating myself, I know) between Morning Musume sub-group Mini Moni and legendary comedian Ken Shimura's Bakatono-sama alter-ego. The only major difference being that their song was far more produced, and done in the staple Mini Moni style rather than following something more fitting of their collaborator. While it's definitely fun to see performers break out of their routine to do silly things from time to time, it's still nice for them to make some kind of sense thematically. I'm not sure about you but I know I'm going to be scratching my head about this whole thing for a couple of days at least.|pikotaro, momoiro clover z, momoclo, vegetable, ppap

Over the past couple of years, we've seen a number of live-action adaptations from Warner Bros. Japan, a trend that's unlikely to slow anytime soon. Just recently we saw the release of Fullmetal Alchemist in a live-action format, with both JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable and Gintama coming before that. It'll be interesting to see how this live-action adaptation performs, especially with the more surreal aspects of Bleach contained within the story. Directed by Shinsuke Sato, the creative behind both live-action Gantz films, it'll be interesting to see how Tite Kubo's massively-popular Bleach manga transitions onto the big screen.

FGO's modern take on the historical figure is now coming to Tokyo for a special show... |Without a doubt, my absolute favorite thing to spring out of the advent of worlds like Fate and Kantai Collection is that you can Google any given historical figure or vessel, and there's a very high chance that your search results will be littered with dozens of cute anime girl versions of your query. In the case of Fate/Grand Order's take on legendary Japanese printmaker Hokusai, we're not quite at that level yet. However, the game's cute girl take on the painter does include some nifty shoutouts, such as the weapon she wields being a giant paintbrush, and her alternate outfit being very fishy -- in reference to Hokusai's "The Fisherman's Wife," perhaps the first piece of eroticism of a human being involved with an octopus ever conceived. Of course, perhaps the best-known Hokusai ukuiyo-e style woodblock painting is "The Great Wave off Kanagawa," which is given a tasteful shoutout with the Fate character's Noble Phantasm, as seen in this article's header image. All this newness surrounding the painter is finally coming to a head next month in Odaiba in Tokyo, where NAKED, an artistic technology company, plan to put on a unique water projection mapping display show for one night only atop the waters of Tokyo Bay. Fate/Grand Order's own Hokusai will gracefully paint the waves of Tokyo Bay with the actual master's own works. Hokusai will be joined by characters Shuten Douji, Kiyohime, Musashi Miyamoto, and even Mash. A brand-new piece of collaboration artwork was released with the announcement. Visitors are especially urged to board one of the event's special yakatabune, a traditional Japanese rowboat. Tickets are available through Lawson Ticket, for cruises leaving at 4:15, 5:00 and 5:45 pm on March 17. The tickets will set you back 16,000 yen (around $150 USD) a seat. As a one-day and likely one-time opportunity, I can't really think of any better way for both history buffs and Fate/Grand Order superfans to spend an evening in Odaiba.

12899|2018-02-20|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/eureka-seven-hi-evolution-interviews/| News | Anime | Taku Takahashi and DÉ DÉ MOUSE Talk Eureka Seven | What happens when you put a 'Eureka Seven' superfan and a series newbie together in the same room? |For a franchise as legendary and beloved by many as Eureka Seven, nothing less than all-out would be acceptable to commemorate the release of both the Blu-ray and DVD versions of Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1. It's the first part of a new trilogy of films, the three of which aim to retell the classic story of the original anime series, with both updated cuts and a number of extra scenes. On top of all that is a promised brand-new ending, something we'll just have to wait until 2019 to witness. In commemoration of the upcoming release, Bandai Visual has called in two special guests to create a promotional discussion video, where both parties discuss the Eureka Seven series and the influence it's had. The first round of interviews has already been made public, featuring both Taku Takahashi of m-flo and DÉ DÉ MOUSE. Taku is a self-described "Eureka Seven freak" who has been following the series from the very early days of the original anime. On the other hand, DÉ DÉ MOUSE is a relative newcomer to the franchise, having only been immersed in Renton's world wholeheartedly with this latest movie release. This creates an interesting catalyst for discussion as the two share both of their experiences with the series. While the videos are yet to be subtitled in English, the back and forth between the two musical contemporaries makes for quite the discussion. For many clued in on the series, Eureka Seven is a story filled to the brim with both musical and pop culture references. This is especially prevalent in areas such as Adroc Thurston's name being a play on "Ad-rock" from The Beastie Boys, or Renton's name being a homage to Mark Renton of the Trainspotting film. It was definitely clear that the two got a kick out of being able to discuss these neat little easter eggs throughout the series. Within their discussions, there's also talk about the qualities they feel they share with main character Renton. They especially compare the overlap in musicians pursuing dreams of success, while Renton slowly but surely realizes his abilities, matures, and earns the respect of his peers. While the Hi-Evolution films aren't remakes per se, the duo do agree that they fall more under the category of a "remix," something quite true to their musical roots. This method was compared to how J.J. Abrams chose to revive the Star Wars universe in a new trilogy of films. By combining familiar story elements and tropes from the past, then fusing them with modern filmmaking and animation elements, the creators have achieved what can be considered a "remix" of Eureka Seven for both new audiences and diehard fans alike. It's a fascinating discussion for sure, so here's hoping that the videos receive some official English translation. The train doesn't stop there, however, as the next set of video interviews is slated for February 22, 2018. Just a day before the home video release, director Tomoki Kyouda, scriptwriter Dai Sato, sociologist and Wako University professor Toshiya Ueno, and anime critic Ryouta Fujitsu will all gather at Tokyo's Dommune nightclub to discuss all manner of topics surrounding Eureka Seven, its cultural impact around the world, and the new films. The individuals present for the talk, which will run from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm JST, make for a panel of guests from backgrounds you don't often see at these kinds of release events. Again, I'm hoping that this series gets some kind of official release in English too! After the talk, there will be a special DJ set by Hiroshi Watanabe titled "Hi-Evolution 1 Special DJ Set!" As for the contents of his performance, the title certainly leaves little to the imagination. After all of this bombast for the release, I'm happy to give you all the juicy details on the various editions and formats you'll be able to get your hands on beginning February 23: Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1 - Blu-ray Limited Edition Price: 10,000yen + Tax Duration: Main Disc - 98 Minutes // Bonus Disc - 178 Minutes Main Disc Specifications: DTS-HD Master Audio(5.1ch)・Linear PCM(Stereo)／AVC／BD50G／16:9<1080p High Definition>／Japanese Subtitles（ON/OFF） Bonus Disc Specifications: DTS-HD Master Audio(5.1ch)・Linear PCM(Stereo)／AVC／BD50G／16:9<1080p High Definition> ・Partial 16:9<1080i High Definition>／Japanese Subtitles（ON/OFF） Main Disc Contents: Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1 Film, Film Commercial Collection Bonus Disc Contents: Non-credit Contents (DTS-HD Master Audio5.1ch／Linear PCM2ch), Stage Greetings, Film Staff Cross Talk Movie, "Glory Days" Music Video (Anime Version), "Acperience 7" Music Video, "Get it by your hands HI-EVO MIX" Music Video, RaveSeane DJ MIX 1, RaveSean DJ MIX 2, 2 Soundtrack CDs, Booklet, Storyboard Booklet (Summer of Love part) Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1 - Blu-ray Standard Edition Price: 7,000yen + Tax Duration: 98 Minutes Disc Specifications: DTS-HD Master Audio(5.1ch)・Linear PCM(Stereo)／AVC／BD50G／16:9<1080p High Definition>／Japanese Subtitles（ON/OFF） Disc Contents: Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1 Film, Film Commercial Collection Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1 - DVD Standard Edition Price: 6,000yen + Tax Duration: 98 Minutes Disc Specifications: DTS(5.1ch)・Dolby Digital(Stereo)／Dual-layer Disc／16:9／ Japanese Subtitles（ON/OFF） Disc Contents: Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1 Film, Film Commercial Collection Those of you who are yet to check out the first entry into the trilogy, this is your best chance.

Now he's been illustrated by series creator Sui Ishida in all his winning glory. |For two-times Olympic gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu, it'd be a complete and total understatement that this has been a big week. Not only did the legendary figure skater manage to secure his second gold medal during the PyeongChang Winter Olympics on Saturday, but he also received notable recognition from a creator he's expressed great appreciation for in the past. Uploaded to the Twitter account of Tokyo Ghoul manga creator Sui Ishida, Yuzuru Hanyu's likeness was captured in gorgeous style as he fearlessly dominated the ice. ️ pic.twitter.com/BQVQBNRy9u — 石田スイ (@sotonami) 18 February 2018 It's undeniably been an incredible week for the 23-year-old figure skating icon, with just about every newspaper and magazine in Japan covered with his likeness. That being said, if I was in his position, I'd have to say this is a little cooler. It originally became apparent to the world that Yuzuru Hanyu was a fan of the series when he was spotted holding a Tokyo Ghoul tumbler in a joint photo with the Sailor Moon of the ice, Evgenia Medvedeva. It was also noted that in the photograph he was doing a pose similar to series protagonist Kaneki, making it all the more incredible. Perhaps more than ever this year, both in Japan and internationally, it felt as though more individuals had a keen eye for the ice skating performances. I'm not going to state it as a fact, but I'd dare suggest that the late-2016 animated series Yuri!!! on ICE might have just had a little to do with that. But hey, if that's the case, I'm sure it would make series creator Sayo Yamamoto happy, which is something she explicitly stated in our interview with her last year. We wish the best of luck to the rest of the Olympians taking place in the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, and congratulate Yuzuru Hanyu on his much-deserved success. |Yuzuru Hanyu, Tokyo Ghoul
12894|2018-02-20|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/sanrio-puroland-kawaii-kabuki/| News | Anime , Manga , Music , Games | Sanrio Puroland Theme Park Introduces 'Kawaii Kabuki' Live | Sanrio Puroland, the official theme park of Hello Kitty and friends is getting a traditional Japanese makeover with the new 'Kawaii Kabuki' live show. |Sanrio Puroland, the official home of Hello Kitty and all her fellow Sanrio friends, is getting a traditional Japanese makeover next month with the theme park starting their new 'Kawaii Kabuki' live musical show. Set to begin March 10, 2018, the live show will bring a piece of Japan's stage history to the Tama Center location in Tokyo with a special side of cute. The show will feature special costumes for all the characters and will utilize projection mapping technology to really impress attendees at the park's Meruhen Theatre. The stage show is set to incorporate traditional kabuki and acrobatic dance to create a memorable experience that will last about 40 minutes a session. It'll also feature characters such as Hello Kitty, Cinnamoroll, Dear Daniel, and Bad Batz Maru, with some of them pictured above. As someone who just so happens to live walking distance from Sanrio Puroland, this is definitely welcome news to me. The whole area surrounding the theme park is certainly unlike anything else in Tokyo, and I'd absolutely have to recommend checking it out. Famed kabuki director Kensuke Yokouchi, best known for his work on Super Kabuki, is handling the script work and staging for the live show. Much like the stage works of creatives such as Shakespeare, many in Japan fall short in understanding the complexities of many kabuki performances. It's for this reason that Sanrio Puroland has opted to use the popular folk legend of Momotaro, a brave peach boy who defeats a band of marauding demons on a distant island so that audiences of all ages can follow along. If you're interested in checking out the show, you'll definitely want to head over to the official website for the theme park. While the show does begin March 10, it's undecided as of right now how long it will last, meaning you'll definitely want to get in while you still can. |Sanrio, Sanrio Puroland, Kawaii Kabuki
12885|2018-02-20|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/cup-noodle-fries-chicken-nugget/| News | N/A | Cup Noodle Releases New 'Fries & Chicken Nugget' Flavor | Cup Noodle is known for doing some pretty weird and wonderful things, and their latest fries and chicken nugget flavored instant noodles definitely fall in the former category. |Since the very conception of Cup Noodles almost 60 years ago in 1958, manufacturer Nissin has constantly been looking for new ways to innovate. For some, innovation comes in the form of redesign and creation; for others, it comes in the form of 'Fried Potato & Chicken Nugget' flavored instant ramen. Today I was given the opportunity to partake in innovation, and honestly, it tastes pretty incredible. If given the chance, I'd probably go as far as to recommend you try this weird and wonderful flavor -- if you dare. For a Cup Noodle brand as easily identifiable as Nissin, you eventually reach the point where you have to do some pretty weird things to stay on top. Between their ridiculous 'Milk Seafood' flavor they released in 2017, the announcement that they would henceforward refer to their topping as 'Mystery Meat,' and the gorgeous animated ads the company produces, there's definitely a growing library of strange. Frequent OTAQUEST collaborator The Canipa Effect was even so wowed by some of the things the company had done in the anime department that he made a whole video about it: Back to the topic at hand, however, Nissin Cup Noodle's latest 'Fried Potato & Chicken Nugget' flavor combination is an absolute fever dream. I'm a lazy boy, meaning there are basically three major food groups for me: instant noodles, fries, and chicken nuggets. This combines the three of those in an oddly coherent method, and I'm all for it. The noodles use a black pepper soy sauce seasoning packet, with both small potato pieces and chicken nugget 'mystery meat' rests atop. Cook it up and you're given what's essentially boiled potato and chicken nuggets -- if you'd really call it that. Apart from that, however, it's basically your standard Cup Noodle affair, something else I'm totally cool with. If you're in the Japan area anytime soon and are dying to try these, I managed to find mine at a local Family Mart, making the restock process easy once I realized how much they ruled. If Cup Noodle is your thing, you'll probably want to check out the official website. Following that, the Cup Noodle Twitter account absolutely slaps and is definitely worth checking out too. |Cup Noodle

The sequel to one of my favorite RPGs of all time, the game has already been delayed multiple times having finally settled on the current simultaneous release date of March 23. No worry -- the extra time for polish will certainly only make it a much more worthy follow-up. With the first title, in addition to the action-RPG, monster-collection-focused gameplay, the audio and visual experience that the game offered was enough to practically move me to tears. The artistic direction for the title came from the creative minds at Studio Ghibli, who have said that they approached this game just like they would have approached one of their films. One of my absolute favorite aspects of the first title was the musical score by Joe Hisaishi, famed composer known for his personal and artistic bond with legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki. And while Studio Ghibli in its previous form is not associated with this sequel, many of the creative minds from the original have returned. Similar to the previous behind-the-scenes video featuring character designer Yoshiyuki Momose, composer Joe Hisaishi gives us a rather personal inside look at the creation process for the game's score. Check it out below. Joe Hisaishi creates music that goes beyond what is expected in gaming. The music used in the battle scenes is unlike anything you've seen in other RPGs. - Akihiro Hino, General Director The Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra has done an incredible job of bringing this world to life it seems, and I am super happy that Joe Hisaishi has been able to transcend any and all medium to deliver a superb and emotionally charged score every time.

12887|2018-02-19|20:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/signal-md-kazuyoshi-yaginuma/| News | Anime | Signal.MD Remarks on Recovery of an MMO Junkie's Director | Anime studio Signal.MD has released a statement in regards to recent anti-Semitic remarks and sentiment held by director Kazuyoshi Yaginuma. |At the beginning of the month, it came to light that a freelance anime director who handled directorial duties for studio Signal.MD's adaptation of Rin Kokuyo's Recovery of an MMO Junkie manga has been both posting and "liking" anti-Semitic content on his public Twitter account. Kazuyoshi Yaginuma, who posts under the handle @yaginuma_san on the platform, has consistently harbored the content on his account since joining in 2011. Just one of the recent tweets liked by Kazuyoshi Yaginuma, director of MMO Junkie and several episodes of Pokemon: Generations :/ And there's much more. pic.twitter.com/384ILL8fLJ — Canipa - 14 Days Until Japan Move (@CanipaShow) February 3, 2018 Another one. Remember, these are just the ones in English, a second language. There are far more in Japanese. https://t.co/7tSCgX3do3 — Canipa - 14 Days Until Japan Move (@CanipaShow) February 3, 2018 A few things are clear after this event. Namely, that there is clearly no language barrier preventing Yaginuma's full understanding of the things he's sharing. He's gone on to discuss his views with other users who have taken to tweeting directly at him and often does so in both English and Japanese. In addition, he's shown no signs of backing down or apologizing for his remarks since this all came to light, and it almost appears as if he's doubling down on it. This is all very troubling, and I can't imagine that the freelance director will be scoring any big jobs anytime soon, especially if the language in a recent news release from the studio that produced and animated Recovery of an MMO Junkie is to be taken to heart: Statement by SIGNAL MD concerning Tweets under the name of whom the director of “Recovery of an MMO Junkie” It has come to our attention that a series of Tweets under the handle, @yaginuma_san, apparently made by Mr. Kazuyoshi Yaginuma have included anti-Semitic comments. SIGNAL MD wishes to make it clear that it is strongly opposed to and deprecates anti-Semitism and all forms of racism or discrimination. Mr. Yaginuma was director of the anime “Recovery of an MMO Junkie” produced by SIGNAL MD, has never been our company member and is no longer employed by us. Assuming the comments which appear under the Twitter handle @yaginuma_san, were indeed made by Mr. Yaginuma, they are not linked to his role as director of “Recovery of an MMO Junkie” and are not supported by SIGNAL MD. We will continue to create works that are moving and enjoyable, with the philosophy of giving excitement to many viewers and working to create works that satisfy our clients. Thank you for your support and understanding. SIGNAL.MD, Inc. Additionally, it's also worth mentioning that Crunchyroll parent company Elation has also shared a statement regarding the actions of Kazuyoshi Yaginuma. This is particularly noteworthy as not only were Crunchyroll responsible for streaming the anime internationally, but they were also a member of the anime's production committee. Their statement can be found below: We do not support the anti-semitic behavior that has been recently reported in relation to Dir. Kazuyoshi Yaginuma. The comments made do not reflect any opinions of Crunchyroll, as we pride ourselves on our diverse, global community that connects through the content they love. — Ellation (@ellation) 9 February 2018 Again, I think that it's worth mentioning that Kazuyoshi Yaginuma is a freelance director, and Recovery of an MMO Junkie originated as a manga by Rin Kokuyo. This news has certainly been the catalyst for much debate in the department of "separating the art from the artist," as the anime was generally seen as a good-hearted and wholesome attempt to characterize video game addiction, without even a hint of the ugliness we've since learned about. For those who are able to love the show and the original property without letting this taint it -- great, I think it stands on many, many of its other merits. For those who cannot bear to do so any longer, I think that is perfectly understandable. Images: Signal.MD, Rin Kokuyo, Media Factory|Signal.MD, Kazuyoshi Yaginuma, Recovery of an MMO Junkie
12886|2018-02-19|19:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/danmachi-new-works/| News | Anime | 'DanMachi' to Receive a Second Season and an Animated Film | The world of 'Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?' is about to get a whole lot larger with a second season and movie in the works. |When it was announced that Fujino Oomori's light novel series Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? would be getting an anime adaptation back in early 2015, there was absolutely a flurry of questions racing through my head. Those questions seemingly answered themselves when I realized that the title was actually referencing a video game-style dungeon, but it was still easy for certain preconceived notions about the contents of the work to float their way about my head. Still, I'm open to mostly anything, so I casually added it to my watch list. Fast forward a few years now and this exact moment has been precisely what I've been looking forward to ever since the show wrapped up. Sure, we got a bit of a continuation in the Sword Oratoria spinoff last year, but I need more of the goddess Hestia and Bell-kun, you know? It seems we'll be getting a double dose of what makes the series the absolute... bestia. At the "GA Bunko 2018 Announcement Stage" event at WonderFestival, it was announced that the project is set to receive both a full-length movie and a second TV anime series. The film is titled Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon: Arrow of the Orion. It will feature a brand-new story by light novel author Fujino Oomori, and what's this -- Hestia in some sort of otherly garb? The ribbon is still there, don't worry too much. It wouldn't be a real piece of the Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon franchise otherwise. The second season of the TV series has had no additional details revealed, and it is unclear as to whether studio J.C. Staff will be returning to animate the pair of projects. If we see both of these works by year's end, you can count me as one happy worshipper. Images: J.C. Staff, SoftBank|Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Fujino Oomori, J.C.

With the explosive third season of My Hero Academia just around the corner, we've been eagerly sitting on the edge of our seats waiting for any news we can get our hands on. Well, it turns out today was our lucky day, with a new key visual for the anime's third season hitting our feeds courtesy of the My Hero Academia official website. If there's anything I'm walking away from this now knowing, it's that I couldn't be more excited. Set to air on Saturday, April 7 here in Japan, fans don't have to wait much longer to get their My Hero Academia Season 3 itch scratched. Perhaps one of the most entertaining Shonen anime I've had the pleasure of enjoying in quite some time, My Hero Academia has achieved an unprecedented level of success both in Japan and internationally. Fittingly so, it's also been announced that the franchise will be receiving its first anime film, the aptly titled My Hero Academia THE MOVIE, which is set to premiere at some point during summer in Japan. I've been a big fan of the series since the initial season began airing late-2015, and am definitely excited to see the story of Deku progress as he further learns to hone his newfound powers. If you're unfamiliar with My Hero Academia, I'd absolutely have to urge you to check it out. It's a series that feels truly fresh amongst so many others of its genre, while still hosting some seriously impressive and memorable moments that keep bringing you back for more.

Within the realm of Japanese music, the early months of 2018 have already celebrated a number of incredible releases. Adding to that rapidly-growing roster is Yusuke Kawai, perhaps better known by his production alias Tofubeats, with his latest single 'Fumetsu no Kokoro,' a sensual ballad with an infectious rhythm and an eye-catching music video. Featuring the signature Tofubeats vocal processing and eclectic production value we've come to know and love from the Kobe-born producer, 'Fumetsu no Kokoro' is sure to leave you dancing. Positioned as the main theme for upcoming live-action television series VIDEO GIRL AI 2018, Tofubeats' latest 'Fumetsu no Kokoro' and its accompanying music video are an adventure from start to finish. Through fourth-wall breaking videography techniques, incredible lyrical hooks, and Tofubeats' comprehensive production value, listeners are whisked away into a high-paced digital landscape crafted by Yusuke's own creation. While putting this piece together I've seriously listened to the song at least 10 times, and I don't picture that count slowing down anytime soon. On the topic of the live-action adaptation of VIDEO GIRL AI 2018, you'll find a number of Tofubeats' contemporaries working alongside him on the soundtrack. Fellow Maltine Records frequents, as well as other net-label artists such as パソコン音楽クラブ, in the blue shirt, ゆnovation, and more find themselves named in the series credits. This is definitely something cool, and I'm excited to see what future opportunities come forward for the artists.

12862|2018-02-19|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/what-is-dance-rush-konami/| News | Anime | What is Dance Rush? // Konami's Bold New Dancing Game | What is Konami's latest rhythm game Dance Rush? Here's everything you need to know ahead of its summer release in North America. |It's been 20 years now since the world was awash with Dance Dance Revolution fever following the arcade title's original release in the year 1998. This was a time when entertainment conglomerate Konami held an iron-grip on the arcade market here in Japan, bolstering an ever-expanding catalog of rhythm games filled with top performing titles such as beatmania and pop'n music. Eyeing out a more international audience, Konami is again looking up to shake up the market in 2018. Enter Dance Rush, an arcade title that perhaps finally shows Konami's eagerness to push internationally in a comprehensive and complete manner. With a system-standard four languages, including Japanese, English, Korean, and Simplified Chinese, Dance Rush is the first Bemani game in a period of time to feel entirely welcoming. The design is sleek and inviting, with just the right amount of flair to attract both casual and veteran rhythm gamers to the dance floor. It's not going to be the most hardcore of games, but it'll definitely serve as a welcome addition to the Bemani family, perhaps acting as a stepping stone for players to discover the genre. Starting the game is simple enough, with players stepping onto a LED-filled dancefloor with sensors throughout. Tasked with shuffling and jumping around with onscreen commands, you'll be breaking a sweat in no time. In all seriousness, however, the game is almost as fun to watch as it is to partake in, creating a goofy yet enjoyable scenario that can be enjoyed by up to four players across two machines. Looking to hit the dancefloor with a friend? Why not use the games inbuilt camera to share it with the world? It's okay, the built-in filters will make anything look slick. Dance Rush boasts the ability to be able to upload to social media sites, including platforms such as YouTube directly. Players who have never played anything like this before can take joy in knowing that the game features numerous "lesson stages," aiming to get you up to spec as quickly as possible. Equipped with a 4.1-channel sound system, Dance Rush not only looks incredible but sounds it too; something you'd hope for from a game so focused on music. You'll find a number of returning artists from other Bemani titles, though you should expect a long list of licensed songs given the games more casual focus. If there was ever a game for Konami to capitalize on the international hype for, Dance Rush would have to be it. With the resurgence of arcade gaming in the United States through the likes of Dave & Busters and Round 1, the next generation of rhythm gamers are eager and ready to get their hands on Japan's latest offerings. Round 1 has already stated that all locations across the United States will be receiving cabinets, though it's unclear as to whether they are importing machines from Japan or buying them directly in the United States. If they are working with Konami's North American branch, then we could only hope that Dave & Busters is on the list as well. With a March 2018 release scheduled for Japan, we'll just have to wait and see how long it takes the title to make its way to North America -- though Round 1 has stated they plan to release it around summer. There's a gaping hole in the rhythm gaming market internationally just waiting to be filled, and we can only hope Dance Rush scratches enough niches and desires to fill it. Would the likes of Dance Rush be enough to get you out of your living room and over to your nearest arcade? |Dance Rush, Konami

She's also not unfamiliar with the Dragon Ball franchise, having voiced Chiko in Dragon Ball Z. Fans of Hiromi Tsuru can take pride in knowing that her voice work still isn't completely released, with the final voice work from her to be released in episode 128 of Dragon Ball Super on February 18.

They're a hyper-groovy duo that consists of vocalist Pon and trackmaker Hideya Kojima, both stemming from Tokyo, Japan, with a focus on fusing some seriously incredible sounds with some equally incredible visuals. Today they dropped their latest release, Hi-Fi TRAIN, the lead track from their upcoming debut album Hi-Fi POPS alongside a dimension-breaking music video. In every single way, ORESAMA has always managed to blow me away. Visually their music videos have always popped out of the screen, blurring the parallel between fantasy and reality. Equally importantly, however, their production value and incredible performance with each release constantly ensure a place in my weekly playlist. This formula for my love is again replicated in Hi-Fi TRAIN, and I've got no doubt in my mind that it'll be a recurring theme throughout all of the Hi-Fi POPS album. Announced alongside the release of the music video, the album is set to release April 11 and consist of a total of 12 songs. Interested in finding out what those songs will be? Well, you can find the full tracklist below: 01. Hi-Fi TRAIN 02. 流星ダンスフロア 03. cute cute 04. 綺麗なものばかり (Album Mix) 05. 誰もが誰かを 06. 耳もとでつかまえて 07.「ねぇ、神様？」 08. Trip Trip Trip 09. ハロー・イヴ 10. SWEET ROOM 11. ワンダードライブ 12. 銀河 (Album Mix) With just a couple of short months until my ears are finally graced with ORESAMA's debut album, I truly can't wait. Until then, however, we'll be sure to keep you up to date with any further news or updates. Image: Lantis, ORESAMA|ORESAMA, Hi-Fi Train, Hi-Fi Pops
12866|2018-02-15|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/crunchyroll-gives-back-100-million/| News | Anime | Crunchyroll Has Made the Anime Industry Over $100 Million | Within its 10 years of service to the community, Crunchyroll has made the Japanese anime industry over $100 million in earnings from fans all around the world. |In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, it was revealed by Crunchyroll co-founder Kun Gao that the San Francisco-based streaming platform had netted over $100 million for the Japanese anime industry through royalty payments over the last 10 years. That's no small number by any means and is an exciting development for the continued growth of such an important industry. It goes without saying that in most parts of the world, the name "Crunchyroll" is pretty much synonymous with "Anime." It's almost a little weird to picture it, but there's an entire generation of people who, for the last 10 or so years, have consumed all their anime from Japan via the San Francisco-based streaming platform. From Naruto to Lupin the Third and even the more obscure likes of Ping Pong The Animation, they're the go-to destination for an entire generation of anime fans. With all that said, it wasn't always smooth sailing for the company. Back during the pre-2008 era of Crunchyroll, the website was mostly operated by user-uploaded content, much to the dismay of license holders in both North America and Japan. It wouldn't be until 2009 that the company would strike a deal with TV Tokyo resulting in them clearing all previously unlicensed content and kickstarting their platform with the Naruto series. It was this level of trust that would ultimately level out into a massive return for an industry that likely considered Crunchyroll as enemy #1. These days you'll find the Crunchyroll name in the credits of a growing number of animated series, as well as on the committees for another handful of content. "We have invested directly in more than 40 productions, including many shows that wouldn't have been made," said Gao. "We have an amazing relationship now with the creators. The animators want to learn about global audiences and what they want." With the recent influx of Western interest in the Japanese anime industry, it's always exciting to see such positive numbers coming forward. In the past year, we ourselves sat down with Kun Gao and discussed the past, present, and future of the streaming giant. That full series can be found via the OTAQUEST YouTube channel, here.

12852|2018-02-14|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/atre-steins-gate/| News | Anime , Games | Akihabara Station Landmark Getting a 'Steins;Gate' Makeover | If you're visiting Akihabara soon, you'll find yourself greeted by a bunch of mad scientist otaku. |It's a sight all-too-familiar to visitors of Tokyo's anime mecca. When you emerge from those ticket gates at the Akihabara Electric Town exit, once you make your way past the pillars plastered with LED screens advertising the latest releases, you see it -- the entrance to the enormous atré department store. The building is no stranger to countless anime collaborations, with the next series to grace the hallowed facade of the department store being Steins;Gate, as sort of a double promotion for both the re-release of the original game titled Steins;Gate Elite, and the anime version of Steins;Gate 0. Actually, this isn't even the first time that the store has played host to Steins;Gate imagery. When the visual novel version of Steins; Gate 0 was released back in 2015, both the station entranceway and the glass walls wrapping around the outside of the station building was decked-out in character designer and artist huke's beautiful portraits. You can see the photos of that exhibit below! The store's wall is hardly ever without some sort of anime decoration. This space is super-important and lucrative, as most everyone who utilizes Akihabara Station will see it. In this case, it was Steins;Gate 0 to make use of the space. A true-to-life version of the time machine was even on display! The atré mascot characters are all sporting some special characters. A bunch of Mad Avians, the lot of them! Of course, you can expect plenty of special and limited time goods as seen in the gallery below. Of special interest is the "Cute Suzuha Eyes Mask"... their words not mine. The collaboration will be running through the end of the month on February 28. Stay tuned for all things Steins;Gate-related, especially as the April air-date for Steins;Gate 0 approaches.

12853|2018-02-14|10:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/batman-ninja-english/| News | Anime | 'Batman Ninja' is Looking Incredible in New English Trailer | An all-star English dub cast is promising for this Sengoku Era take on the Batman story. |Everyone's been calling me the most powerful man in Japan. The Demon King, Lord Joker! Honestly, this is a line I would have never expected to be uttered at any point in human existence, but here we are in 2018 and Batman Ninja is definitely a thing that is happening, and is right on track for May 8 release. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment has uploaded the Batman Ninja trailer with our first preview of the English dub, and the cast is littered with the exact people you'd want to hear in a new Batman animated work. Check out the trailer below. Roger Craig Smith, who also voiced The Dark Knight in the Batman: Arkham Origins video game is reprising his role. Tony Hale is onboard to play the Joker. The rest of the cast is rounded out with Grey Griffin as Catwoman, Tara Strong as Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, Fred Tatasciore as Gorilla Grodd and Deathstroke, Yuri Lowenthal as Robin, Adam Croasdell as Nightwing and Alfred, Will Friedle as Red Robin and Red Hood, Tom Kenny as Penguin, and Eric Bauza as Two-Face. This Kamikaze Douga production is directed by Junpei Mizusaki, who handled the iconic JoJo's Bizarre Adventure openings. Writer Kazuki Nakashima of Gurren Lagann fame, and character designer Takashi Okazaki, who worked on cult action hit Afro Samurai round off a seriously impressive production leadership team. Warner Bros. has stated quite plainly that the English script was re-written for release outside of Japan. It will be handled by Leo Chu and Eric Garcia, who also had a large role in the production of Afro Samurai. This is fascinating to me, considering that the story is set in Sengoku Era Japan. If individual aspects of a story revolving around a katana-wielding, jiu-jitsu-employing, tea-sipping Batman need to be tweaked for an international audience, I am very eager to compare any possible differences. A fascinating cross-cultural project has reared its head once again, and amidst all the flash I'm hoping for a triumph. The direct-to-video release will be launching on May 8 on Blu-ray and DVD, so there's not much longer now. Warner Bros. describes Batman Ninja's story: Batman Ninja takes a journey across the ages as Gorilla Grodd's time displacement machine transports many of Batman's worst enemies to feudal Japan - along with the Dark Knight and a few of his allies. The villains take over the forms of the feudal lords that rule the divided land, with the Joker taking the lead among the warring factions. As his traditional high-tech weaponry is exhausted almost immediately, Batman must rely on his intellect and his allies - including Catwoman and the extended Bat-family - to restore order to the land, and return to present-day Gotham City.

I've mentioned time and time again these past few weeks that m-flo is up to some seriously big things this year, something that's just become all the more apparent. Just over a month ago we got a two minute audio-only peek into "No Question," from the recently revived trio's upcoming The Tripod E.P.2 which is set to release March 7, 2018 -- and now we've got the music video to match. Celebrating the group's 20th anniversary, the original trio consisting of LISA, Taku Takahashi, and VERBAL is back and stronger than ever, especially if their latest music video is anything to go by: It's only fair that for such a momentous occasion that the group would look back to their roots with a new palette of skills and a sense of nostalgia. If you've been longing for that classic m-flo sound, you're absolutely going to find it in "No Question," something that we're definitely excited about. Just analyzing the song on its own, it's filled with so much of that signature sound that defined the group 20 years back while still mixing in a new level of maturity and development -- no questions asked, it's the perfect blend. LISA's vocals, VERBAL's flow, Taku's production, every piece of the puzzle fits so perfectly together that we're left with an image of greatness unlike any other. For such an incredible song, we're of course going to find an equally incredible music video; so who better to feature in it than the trio themselves? Analyzing the music video, "No Question" aims to showcase the maturity of the trio as they reflect over the explosive last 20 years of their musical careers. Showcased through the likes of LISA shaving her head (it looks incredible, by the way) and the beautiful ending sequence where the whole group gets back together for a group hug, it really feels like this is how things were meant to be. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that 2018 is the year of m-flo, and I couldn't be more excited to see what happens. If you're curious as to what's going on in the world of m-flo, especially with the recent announcement that LISA would be returning to the group for their 20th anniversary and onwards, you'll definitely want to check out our extensive archives including interviews and exclusives. |m-flo

Sony-owned video streaming platform Crackle, now known as Sony Crackle, has just added an incredible roster of animated classics to its library, including the likes of Lupin the Third: Legend of the Gold of Babylon, Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer, and more. The content added are all licensed by Discotek Media, and the move closer ensures the digital preservation of classic media in a legal manner, something that I couldn't be more excited about. With the addition of roughly 10 new Discotek Media licenses to the service, viewers will be able to enjoy content that previously would be unavailable online using legal methods. The full list of added content can be found below: Black Jack The Movie Cromartie High School Dallos Fist of the North Star (Movie) Jin-Roh Lupin the Third: The Legend of the Gold of Babylon Street Fighter (TV Series) Street Fighter II: The Movie Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer Wicked City Sony Crackle's online service operates in about 21 countries, allowing viewers access to content free of charge, with ads scattered throughout playtime. While I personally hadn't used the service apart from a glance at it a few years back, it was exciting to see how simple it was to access films like Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer with just a few ads scattered throughout. Speaking of Urusei Yatsura, Diskotek Media is teaming up with RightStuf to bring the film to Blu-ray across the US, with pre-order available now and a Feb. 27 release date. If you're interested in checking out the offerings of the platform, be sure to check out their official website.

Come take a tour with us! |As an anime studio, ufotable has achieved a reputation for being able to produce some seriously impressive-looking animation. They've been the home of many mainline Fate universe (or the Type-Moon verse, or the Nasuverse) anime adaptations since the brilliance that was Fate/Zero in 2011. They've also made a name for themselves through some really cool efforts to connect with their fans, a famous example being the "ufotable Cafes," where they promote their newest properties with genuinely tasty food and drink options. Currently, the theme at the ufotable Cafe is a double dose of Fate -- you'll be able to find menu items from both Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel - I. Presage Flower and Today's Menu for Emiya Family, as well as a dining room positively decked out in related decorations and merch. I recently had a chance to hit up the ufotable Cafe in Nagoya, so please follow me on this delightful little culinary adventure. One of the first sights to greet visitors are the large Fate/ series posters hanging on the wall. The upholstery on the booths is an incredible-looking 'Fate' manga pattern. The view from our table -- large cutouts of two very good girls included. We decided to get up and take a look around the space before our food arrived. Rin's necklace was the real deal! Adorable Assassin Aww... The boys are back in town. I don't know which is making me sweat more, the mabo tofu or Kirei... Production materials from Today's Menu for Emiya Family, as well as the assorted coasters you can collect by ordering various drinks at the cafe. Returning to the table, it was time to inspect the wares! But first, a quick turn around to more closely inspect the booth. It was easily one of my favorite parts of the interior decoration. Sakura, thank you. Oh, it just so happened that we were celebrating this special lady's birthday too! A limited-time display was set up, and Rin's birthday dessert was temporarily added to the menu. The first drink arrived! This was Illya's themed drink from Today's Menu for Emiya Family -- a grape juice and yogurt mix Next up -- a handsome cup of tea. Sometimes, collaborative cafe menu items only look pretty, and don't taste up to snuff. My experience at the ufotable Cafe was not as such. Everything I sampled was insanely delicious. The main course -- the exact toshikoshi soba from episode 1 of Today's Menu for Emiya Family! After dinner I ordered a "The Third Battle" drink from Heaven's Feel. Mix it up, and it turns black. I really wanted to keep the red, light-up cube... Each entree comes with a random placemat. Before leaving, it was of course necessary to check out the gift shop area. It not only stocks the items from the current promotion, but also those from the cafe's past themes. Of course, feel free to contribute to the signbooks! Or to the special message board. Thanks for joining us!|Fate/Stay Night, ufotable Cafe, Today's Menu for Emiya Family
12842|2018-02-12|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/fate-grand-order-arcade-impressions/| News | Games | Fate/Grand Order Arcade Will Dominate Japanese Arcades | After spending a day with the upcoming Fate/Grand Order Arcade title, there's no doubt in my mind that this game will take over Japan's arcade scene. |Set to release July 2018, SEGA and Type-Moon's upcoming Fate/Grand Order Arcade is looking to be one of the most promising arcade titles of the year. Whenever the topic of Type-Moon's massively-popular Fate/Grand Order comes to my attention, it's not something I can simply dismiss. Arguably one of the biggest games in Japan right now, the spinoff from the original Fate/Stay Night visual novel has gone on to build an entire empire of its own. So when word of an arcade release of the game from the team at SEGA came to light, I had been left on the edge of my seat waiting for new information. Well, now that I've seen and enjoyed the aptly-titled Fate/Grand Order Arcade, the upcoming action rump is arguably all that's on my mind. Featuring a similar design to the already-striking Kantai Collection Arcade machines, the Fate/Grand Order Arcade setup was certainly an eye-catcher. With a relatively simple interface, the machines sport a pair of larger buttons, a joy-con with an additional two buttons and a touchscreen display. To the right of your seat, you'll see a printing station where players will be collecting their various gatcha pulls, again akin to pre-existing SEGA arcade titles like Kantai Collection Arcade. Gameplay is absolutely one of the games strongest suits, pulling queues from a number of titles to flip Fate/Grand Order's traditional combat system into an action-packed rumble worthy of King Arthur. The 3v3 arena title will launch with roughly 10% of the mobile games 200+ servants, counting in at 20 during launch. This number won't stay that small for long, however, with the creators mentioning they'd like to incorporate the full mobile roster eventually. Players will be switching between three characters of their choosing and will be placed into teams of three different players. There will also be a single player aspect to the game, which was a feature added by popular demand during initial testings of the game in Akihabara. If it works systematically anything like Kantai Collection Arcade, expect extended play sessions and a lot of coins being dropped. You can check out gameplay of the title below: Set to be released during Summer 2018, players will want to start lining up at their local arcade when the game launches in July during their break. There's not a doubt in my mind that, much like Kantai Collection Arcade before it, Fate/Grand Order Arcade will become the must-play arcade title throughout 2018. While there's little chance of an international release, you'll definitely want to give the game a go if you're in Japan and have a few extra 100 yen coins to spend. |Fate/Grand Order
12822|2018-02-12|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/animator-supporters-2018/| News | Anime | 'Animator Supporters' Kicks Off 2018 Crowdfunding | If you want to make an animator's life easier, supporting the efforts of Animator Supporters is a great place to start! |Last year, anime fans from around the world banded together to donate a stunning amount of money to the 2017 Animator Dormitory project, an initiative started in 2015 by the Japan-based non-profit organization Animator Supporters. Due to fan generosity, the group was able to officially begin their expansion into a total of four dormitories, with that blessed fourth building scheduled for opening in March of this year. Just next month, Animator Supporters will be housing an additional two women from the Japanese anime industry, for a grand total of eleven animators housed so far! This year the funds that the group is collecting from their crowdfunding efforts are to ensure that the four properties can remain open for the length of 2018. They have already achieved some stunning numbers from their Japanese supporters. As of this writing, the Animator Supporters campaign has raised 1,128,000 yen, which is the equivalent of around $10,320 USD. Within the anime industry, the topic of animator's salaries has caught quite a lot of people's attention. Jun Sugawara, the NPO's founder, has outlined three of the most troubling points about the standards of living for animators in the industry: Animators in their twenties often make no more than 90,000 yen a month 90% of new animators quit within 3 years due to low pay and harsh working conditions Without proper support and mentoring for animators, Japanese animation as a cultural pillar risks collapse The organization thus far operates three different dormitories in Tokyo's Suginami ward, which is famous for being the headquarters of a huge number of anime studios in Japan. With the opening of that fourth dormitory next month, fans who have donated to this cause have directly influenced the anime industry by making the lives of eleven animator's just that much better. The creatives are able to circumnavigate Tokyo's often ludicrous rent prices, all while housing themselves in a proper learning environment. Animator Supporters only plan to expand on this positive trend and are hoping that their efforts inspire even more positive change in the industry. You can find this year's Japanese campaign page right here on ReadyFor, a Japanese crowdfunding and generosity platform. This is an all-or-nothing campaign, so if they do not raise the required amount of 2,000,000 by May 2, then they won't be receiving any of the cash. Every bit helps! The group has also made a point of running separate campaigns in English on other platforms, so you can bet that we'll be bringing you the news right away when the NPO decides on a strategy and platform for their primarily English-speaking supporters too!|animator supporters

An element almost inseparable from the games themselves -- Square Enix has decided to ask her to lend her voice to craft an iconic ballad once again for the Disney crossover, Tetsuya Nomura-led RPG series' third entry, scheduled to release at last this year. Hikaru Utada will be singing both the English and Japanese versions of the game's theme. In English, it will be known as "Don't Think Twice." Check out a short preview below! In Japanese, the name of the tune is "Chikai," which can be translated to mean "Oath." In addition, Square Enix revealed that there will be a brand-new Monsters Inc.-themed world in Kingdom Hearts III. It’s featured in the trailer below, and Sora’s form in that world is a sight to behold indeed. So there you have it — an absolute bombshell’s worth of announcements from D23 Expo Japan. What do you think of Hikaru Utada’s latest? When Kingdom Hearts III launches later this year for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, will it have that same cultural impact as the first two mainline games? Accompanied with a theme as strong as the previews tease, I imagine we’ll have a clear winner on our hands. Images: Disney, Square Enix|Hikaru Utada, Kingdom Hearts III, Square Enix

DVD/Blu-Ray | Set to release across North America on February 13, Pokémon The Movie: I Choose You! is coming to Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Viz Media. |Viz Media has announced that they're bringing the latest entry into the Pokémon film universe, "Pokémon The Movie: I Choose You!" to Blu-ray and DVD across North America. What would you do if, on your 10th birthday, you were whisked away on an adventure that would lead to you becoming something no one ever was? That's essentially the question that, on April 1, 1997, viewers in Japan and eventually worldwide were posed through the lens of Pokémon: The Series. Built off the backbone of the massively popular Pokémon video game series, director Kunihiko Yuyama crafted an animated universe that would captivate the minds of children all over the globe. It wouldn't be until 20 years later that we would revisit this question, this time explored through the Pokémon The Movie: I Choose You animated film. The 20th anniversary animated film revisits the origins of the original animated series, re-inviting viewers to travel with Ash and his companion Pikachu on a mythical adventure across the Kanto region. For audiences in North America, this magic could originally only be captured during a very limited number of screenings in cinemas, until now. Viz Media has announced that they're bringing the retelling of Ash and Pikachu's first adventure to Blu-ray and DVD on February 13. The film is also the birthplace of one of the last years most debated franchise-related topics, with Pikachu speaking human language. If you're clinging for a chance to get your hands on this adventure, you'll want to head over to Viz Media's official website.

12808|2018-02-07|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/mflo-yuce-dj-shimamura-remix/| News | Music | YUC'e & DJ Shimamura Remixes of m-flo Classics Released | Ahead of their upcoming tripod EP, m-flo has been releasing a series of remixes calling on the talents of some of Japan's greatest underground talents including both YUC'e and DJ Shimamura. |Calling on the talents of DJ Shimamura and YUC'e, BACK2THEFUTURE Pt. 4 offers an incredible take on m-flo classics. If asked to describe the state of Japan's underground music scene in the early stages of 2018, there's one word that comes to mind, "frantic." It happens once every few years, a seemingly natural transition from underground to mainstream appeal for a lot of young talent who are constantly paving the way for new sounds. Making the transition from underground to mainstream is rarely something that just happens, however, and it's often through the keen eyes of industry veterans assisting the next generation of musicians that we get such change. In my eyes, m-flo has always been a group that excelled in propelling the next generation, and that's again exemplified with both DJ Shimamura and YUC'e. For 20 years now m-flo has been the go-to place to discover the next big thing musically here in Japan, with each member constantly looking to push the boundaries of the entertainment industry. Their latest efforts to do as such have led to them to recruit 12 artists across all genres to remix and flip the group's all-time classics, releasing each remix in sets of two across six remix packs. The fourth entry into these packs contains the hardcore legend DJ Shimamura and the shooting star that is YUC'e. Each has made an incredible name for themselves in their respective scenes, which makes hearing them on such a major release all the sweeter. Between the flurrying hardcore groove presented in DJ Shimamura's remix of "All I Want Is You," and the glitch hop fueled burst of energy that is YUC'e's remix of "the Love Bug," there's absolutely no room for error in this release. From start to finish, each song takes listeners on an adventure unlike anything else, creating an experience that would energize even the most laidback of clubs, while remaining appealing to casual listeners. Both DJ Shimamura and YUC'e really outdid themselves on this one and I can't be more impressed. With two more releases to go, as well as the three releases prior to this, I really must implore you to delve into the incredible roster of talent that m-flo has called on for these releases. Each release is available on just about every platform imaginable, though finding them can be streamlined immensely by checking out the official website.|m-flo, YUC'e, DJ Shimamura

In November 2015 the world was graced with what would go on to be one of the coolest collaborations ever courtesy of JR West and Evangelion. Inviting both residents and tourists alike to get in the robot, the 500 Type EVA Shinkansen absolutely blew our mind upon introduction and continues doing so to this day. The collaboration between JR West and Evangelion would call on the talents of series creator Hideaki Anno as supervisor, and Eva mechanical designer Ikuto Yamashita to design the layout of the train. Unfortunately, as with everything great on this planet, the train's service must come to an end. The date for this planned End of Evangelion? May 13, 2018, making this crunch time if you're planning on ever riding this magnificent feat of humanity. If you think the outer design of the train is sleek, just wait until you get inside of the shinkansen. Everything about this screams Evangelion, something that I'm 200% down with. The interior featured NERV's signature imagery, and even the staff wore themed outfits. Announcements on the train were made by Kaworu himself, and certain lucky individuals were even able to sit in the cockpit as shown at roughly 5:00 in the above video. With not much time left in the 500 Type EVA Shinkansen's lifetime, you'll definitely want to head over to the English-language website to find out even more details on how you can get onboard.

The video finds itself comprised of a lot of important questions, even some canon-altering questions; but let's get into that later. Opening on a strong note, the video poses a simple question to Mr. Koizumi, "Why does Mario have nipples, but no belly button?" Listen here, Nintendo -- or perhaps, more importantly, Mr. Koizumi; as the overseer of the entire Super Mario Odyssey title, we know you're hiding some secrets. Whatever these secrets, big or small, the players of Super Mario Odyssey are by all means digging deeper and deeper to discover them. That's why when your answer to such an important question was a clear non-answer, instead pointing to a suggested re-evaluation of the current design, we definitely know we're onto something. Is Mario Mario, the brother of Luigi Mario and the individual formally known as "Jump Man" to the public masses, actually born from an egg similar to Nintendo fan favorite Yoshi? Other topics covered throughout the video include whether or not Toad's head is actually their head or a hat. Yoshiaki Koizumi weighs in on this one declaring once and for all that Toad's head is, in fact, his actual head and not a hat. This, of course, renders The Adventures of Super Mario Brothers 3 - Tag Team Trouble as non-canon and means the series should not be considered factual to the Mario continuum. Following this, the video dwells into the status of Mario, Peach, and Pauline to which Mr. Koizumi firmly asks viewers to respect the privacy of the three characters. The video is filled with some genuinely entertaining moments and is definitely worth checking out outside of those select questions. While I joke at the fact that one of Nintendo's higher-ups would have to answer anything involving Mario's belly button, it is refreshing to see any company interact with fans in such a way.

As of December 2017, the game commands an audience of 18 million and is now available on both iOS and Android.

With Bayonetta 1 & 2 set to receive Nintendo Switch releases in the coming couple of weeks on February 16, we're inching closer and closer to one of my most anticipated handheld releases of the year, albeit a re-release. Without access to a Wii U to play the sequel to my favorite action-adventure title of all time, I was over the moon to hear that the game would be receiving a Nintendo Switch release. Afterall, who wouldn't want to fight angels on the go as one of the baddest witches in town? As with most re-releases on next-generation consoles, this also means we're seeing some visual and performance upgrades to the game. While visuals aren't necessarily everything, the benefits are always welcome. Running at a full 60 fps, fight scenes are set to look seriously incredible on the Nintendo Switch release of the game. On top of that, shadows are looking much smoother in both titles, as well as loading times being reduced by as much as 10 seconds. Driving the performance improvements home, YouTube channel Nintendo World Report TV shared a comparison video for both Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2. Those comparison videos can be found below: Bayonetta: Nintendo Switch vs Wii U Release Bayonetta 2: Nintendo Switch vs Wii U Release With less than two weeks until we can finally get our hands on the Nintendo Switch version of both games, the excitement is definitely mounting.

That's why news of both Dempagumi.inc and Inio Asano working together for a second time on the group's latest single, "Oyasumi Polaris Sayonara Parallel World," is making my week; so let's look at what's going on. Recently Dempagumi.inc took in two new members, which was pretty massive news in itself. The group's upcoming single is the first work to feature the new members, while also bringing in Inio Asano to write lyrics and create artwork -- that's huge. This isn't Dempagumi.inc's first time working with famed mangaka Inio Asano, in 2015 the group crafted the above single "Ashita Chikyu ga Konagona ni natte mo." For those unfamiliar with either, Inio Asano is undoubtedly best known in the West for his Solaris series, as well as Oyasumi Punpun (Goodnight Punpun). Each and every one of his works is often held in the highest regard, with Oyasumi Punpun maintaining a 9.1/10 over 39,778 votes on MyAnimeList. Dempagumi.inc, on the other hand, are a new-age idol group best known for their larger-than-life music videos and otaku-centric lyrics. They've got an incredible track record, and around 10 years of experience to back them up. You might know them for this season's smash-hit anime The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. 2 and their ED work on it of which can be streamed below. Included in the upcoming release will be their latest "Oyasumi Polaris Sayonara Parallel World," the aforementioned ED for The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. 2, "Ψ Hakkenden! ," and another original "Girametasu Dempa Stars."

With the amazing success of DEVILMAN crybaby tucked firmly under Netflix's belt, anime fans around the globe are awaiting the company's next anime offerings with baited breath. A joint effort between anime studios LIDEN FILMS and Dwango, Lost Song is a Netflix streaming exclusive when the series debuts this Summer in full after its Japanese TV broadcast. So yes, Lost Song returns to the kind of previous Netflix exclusive formula, in that it is not technically receiving funding from the company. The show is simply licensed to Netflix for international streaming rights. As it was previously revealed, voice actresses Konomi Suzuki and Yukari Tamura have starring roles in Lost Song, as characters Rin and Finis respectively. Konomi Suzuki will be singing the show's theme song, titled "If I Sing, You Will Be There." Konomi Suzuki, lovingly referred to as 'Konomin' by her fans, is one of my favorite voice actresses and musical stars at the moment. I'm always thrilled to hear more of her work, and Lost Song itself is looking to be a refreshing, colorful fantasy romp. A new key visual for the show was also revealed, and it is just as lush and colorful as you'd expect based on what we saw in the trailer. Netflix has provided a summary of Lost Song's plot: Rin (Konomi Suzuki), an energetic girl who loves to eat, lives in a verdant frontier village. Deep within the royal palace in the bustling capital city, the songstress Finis (Yukari Tamura) spends her days in solitude. Both share a special power no other person has. A miraculous power that can heal wounds, create water and stir the wind -- the power of song. Guided by destiny, the two young women each face an arduous journey with the power of song. The shadow of war looms over the kingdom, tainting even the miraculous songs with the blood of innocents. Loved ones meet their deaths as silent screams echo through a stone prison. As two destinies intersect, will the final song be one of despair, hope or...? Netflix will stream the show weekly in Japan beginning March 31, followed by weekly TV broadcasts on Tokyo MX1 on April 7. The worldwide streaming release is expected to go live on Netflix sometime this Summer, after the show wraps its broadcast run.

The show will run for 10 episodes total, with each episode averaging about 15 minutes in length. The anime will be dubbed in eight languages and subtitled in 23 languages.

Unless you had been closely following the credit-rolls of tons of anime airing each season, and actively knew the names of the staff members, then Studio Wanpack is likely never a name to have ever crossed your radar. And that's not necessarily a fault of your own by any means. The studio is known throughout the anime industry as being one that handled in-between animation correction, usually referred to as "2nd key animation." And wow, did they certainly handle a lot. Shows as recent as this season's Yuru Camp and Fall's Animegataris; beloved hits of yesteryear like Aria, Cowboy Bebop and The End of Evangelion -- you name it, and there's a good chance that the Osaka-based studio has had their hand in ensuring that the animation produced by the key animators was up to snuff before airing. It's super-important work, and somebody had to do it. Studio Wanpack is like an invisible force -- as you can imagine, the bulk of their work was received via outsourcing, and those bigger names that you know and love would likely be unable to keep their deadlines if they didn't have such a reliable partner to count on. Now that they are ducking out of the game, we can only hope that the incredible talent from the studio is absorbed into some of the bigger houses. Studio Wanpack made the announcement on Twitter today: 【訃報とおしらせ】 ２０１８年１月２日に 元スタジオ代表 山田 浩嗣が逝去いたしました それに伴い、２０１８年２月２８日をもって スタジオ・ワンパックは解散する事となりました ２４年間今までありがとうございました ＨＰも閉鎖いたします スタジオ・ワンパックＨＰhttps://t.co/YKIJBHYK2z pic.twitter.com/PMWYPTksSq — スタジオ・ワンパック (@StudioWanpack) February 1, 2018 On January 2, 2018, Studio Representative Koji Yamada passed away.

It was initially revealed to fans last year that the band would be taking a hiatus so Yoshimasa could focus on treatment, although the band resumed touring later in the year with their final live show occurring on December 28th, 2017. The band was also working on a new album, entitled "LIFE", which is still on schedule to be released on April 25th of this year. Yoshimasa formed ET-King in 1999 along with band members Masuharu Kumabe (KLUTCH) and Takahiro Moriwaki (TENN). Due to all 3 members wanting to be vocalists for the group, they later expanded into a 7 member unit with Yoshimasa being the primary composer and trackmaker for all of their releases. In 2006 they made their major label debut with Universal Music Japan, and in 2007 they saw their first major success with the track "愛しい人へ". In 2008 they were chosen as one of the bands to cover the original Yatterman theme song for use in the newly rebooted animated series focused on the franchises original Time Travel trope. They continued touring and releasing albums regularly from this time until 2012. In 2014 tragedy struck the band when founding member, TENN, passed away in September. The band decided to take a break upon his passing, but continued working; starting a label and creating their own studio. In July 2015 it was announced that they would resume activity with all of the surviving members, releasing their next studio album in 2016 and continuing touring activity. At this time Yoshimasu began using the pseudonym Makoto Takahira for his production work. While ET-King is a relatively obscure band in the United States, their success in Japan created 6 studio albums, 17 singles, countless live tours, and a legion of fans. Yoshimasu's passing is definitely tragic, and our thoughts are with his loved ones. For his fans, the work that he created will continue to live on; and we hope that this news (sad though it may be) introduces his work to some new listeners who will be touched by it as well.

A new mobile application is now in development: Mario Kart Tour! #MarioKartTour Releasing in the fiscal year ending in March 2019. pic.twitter.com/8GIyR7ZM4z — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) 1 February 2018 Mario Kart Tour will be the fifth title that Nintendo has released on smartphone devices, but will likely be one of only four active applications with the closure of Miitomo. Not much more was revealed from the usually tight-lipped Nintendo, but the inclusion of Mario Kart Tour in the mobile application scene is definitely a big move for the company. We reported yesterday that Nintendo as a company has seen a 261% rise in profits over the last year, and that's only expected to keep rising. With Nintendo set to release Mario Kart Tour on smartphone devices sometime between April 2018 - March 2019, the Kyoto-based company is further closing in on the on-the-go gaming market. Takashi Mochizuki of WSJ has gone on to share that more details will be revealed when appropriate, as detailed by Tatsumi Kimishima, the current CEO of Nintendo. Until that time, however, we'll be keeping a close eye on the happenings of Nintendo and keep you updated as more is announced. |Mario Kart Tour, Nintendo

The partnership aims to further expand the streaming services catalog of original animation while ensuring a high-level of quality. The content produced will then be made available in 190 countries for streaming with multiple language options available. With Netflix making more and more major moves in the industry, we can only wait and see where the Bones and Production I.G partnership takes them Netflix has expressed interest in the past to become a hub for anime content, and partnerships with well-known studios such as Bones and Production I.G only acts to solidify this. Included in the dealings is Production I.G sub-group Wit Studio, the studio responsible for series such as Attack on Titan, The Ancient Magus' Bride, and After the Rain. In the announcement from Netflix, the deal was described as a "win-win-win" for all parties involved.

The series received notably high praise from online communities and reviewers alike, ushering in waves of support for Netflix' movement into anime. With 2018 already shaping up to be an incredible year for Netflix, it'll be interesting to see how this latest dealing works out.

12763|2018-01-31|16:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-switch-exceeds-expectation/| News | Games | Nintendo Collects Coins and Increases Switch Projections | Nintendo announced a 261% profit increase in the months leading to December 2017, and increases their Switch sales projections accordingly. |For all that many people have had to say about 2017, Nintendo definitely has nothing to complain about if their recent investors report has anything to say about it. Reporting some of the highest figures for the company since 2009, Nintendo announced today that they're raising their Nintendo Switch sales projections in light of a 261% increase in operating profit for Q3 2017. Previous forecasts for their new hybrid console had them expecting 14 million units moved in its first year, but Nintendo is bumping that figure to 15 million thanks to very strong momentum. Despite analysts being skeptical upon the initial news of the switch last year, the console sold 7.23 million units in Q3 alone. This could be thanks to a very strong lineup of games, including the universally praised "Super Mario Odyssey" and the expanded port of "Mario Kart 8" from their previous Wii U console. It could easily be said that the Switch had one of the strongest first year games lineups in a very long time, especially when you consider digital only & indie offerings. Whether it was carefully planned or not, their strategy has created a solid following and pulled in gamers from all backgrounds. Thankfully Nintendo has always been the kind of company to stick to their guns and take risks despite the potential drawbacks, and as a lifeline fan of not only their work, but also gaming in general, I wouldn't have it any other way Nintendo has also made it a point to mention that strong Switch sales have not hindered the 3DS at all, with the traditional handheld platform even seeing a sales increase over the holiday season. Games like Metroid: Samus Returns and Pokemon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon surely helped, as well as a strong push for the newly designed Nintendo 2DS XL. Despite owning both Japanese & US models of the standard 3DS, it took a lot of willpower personally to not throw down for one of the slick Pokeball themed new 2DS systems that they released for the holidays. Additionally, Nintendo mentioned that their mobile strategy has been successful so far (even with the recent news of Miitomo's upcoming closure) with mobile profits up 172% for the year. Its hard to think that only a few years ago many were crying doom and gloom for the big N. After a weak response to the Wii U, the loss of industry legend Satoru Iwata, and a bit of a false start with their mobile strategy, it was pretty easy to think that things weren't so bright for the house that Mario built. Thankfully Nintendo has always been the kind of company to stick to their guns and take risks despite the potential drawbacks, and as a lifeline fan of not only their work, but also gaming in general, I wouldn't have it any other way. With upcoming ports of many popular Wii U titles for the Switch, the recently announced Nintendo Labo, and a ton of great 3rd party games on the horizon, 2018 is sure to be another positive year for the Kyoto-based company.

The upcoming anime adaptation of Keiichi Sigsawa's light novel spinoff of the Sword Art Online franchise introduces viewers to an alternative story for the Gun Gale Online series arc. Included in the announcement was a new key visual, as shared below: Sword Art Online: Alternative Gun Gale Online is without a doubt one of the more ambitious anime projects to surface as of late, and that almost entirely stems from the names associated with it. On one hand, we're talking about a side-story stemmed almost entirely from the world of Sword Art Online, something which in itself is already a massive deal. Throw in the fact that the story was written by Keiichi Sigsawa, the very same author who wrote Kino's Journey, and that's where things get interesting. With the ever-present popularity of the Sword Art Online series, it'll be interesting to see how the spinoff is received both domestically and internationally. With just a few short months until the anime finally hits the airways, there's definitely a level of excitement from all of us. If there was ever a studio that could be deemed perfect for the project, it would definitely have to be Studio 3Hz, leaving us on the edge of our seats to see what they do with the series. Until then, we'll be waiting patiently taking in some of this season's incredible animated offerings. We'll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed.

12752|2018-01-30|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/octopath-traveler-feedback/| News | Games | Square Enix is Serious About Your Octopath Traveler Feedback | Square Enix is setting an example of what taking player feedback into account should be like in the normal process of game development. |When Square Enix released the Octopath Traveler demo for the Nintendo Switch back in September of last year, they promised that they would listen very carefully to player feedback. They even went so far as to send an email complete with a survey attached wherein players could rate the game as it was on a scale of 5 stars, as well as offer any points of improvement. In a move that I can only hope will become a new standard for fan interaction from developers, Square Enix has released a five-minute-long video featuring key members of the Octopath Traveler development team wherein they address the biggest concerns they received from the player feedback survey. Give the video a watch below -- did any of your own suggestions make the cut? Some of the outstanding complaints received from the player feedback survey included the characters' movement speed, visibility issues stemming from the game's unique graphical style, general issues with the game's user interface, the lack of ability to skip cutscenes, and balance complaints with the battle system. The developers have all gone out of their way to politely explain how happy they are to receive such an immense response, and then detail the fixes they've implemented. In regards to movement speed, now you no longer have to push a button to activate your character's dash. On top of that, pushing that button will now cause you to run even faster, but comes with the tradeoff of a higher monster encounter rate. This is for your own good -- you really don't want to speed through an RPG and find yourself under-leveled. Fast travel (warping) is available too. "With their audience at the forefront of their attention, it feels like Square Enix are truly going above and beyond with Octopath Traveller." In dungeons where it was potentially difficult to see what exactly was going on, small changes to things like textures and brightness have been implemented. A radar feature not present in the demo has also been implemented at this point. On the UI side of things, text has been made bigger and it's now more difficult to accidentally overwrite a save-game slot. The game's message speed has been adjusted, and naturally, the ability to skip cutscenes has also been added. Finally, the developers promise that the battle system has yet more to offer, with a special shout out being given to how the game handles four-member battles. Inside of a major company like Square Enix, it's amazing to see player outreach and fan interaction on this level. If the rest of the AAA games industry can follow Square Enix's lead on initiatives like this; a level of interaction seen only a few times from major developers yet many times among the indie crowd, I can only see gaming becoming that much better for everyone.

If you would tick the "Yes" box to RSVP, then you'll probably want to head over to J-World in Tokyo and make yourself right at home. The amusement center, located in Tokyo's Ikebukuro area, is home to all things Shonen Jump; making it a fitting area for one of their most bizarre attractions yet, following the addition of "Dio no Yakata," a labyrinth-style attraction with multiple branching paths and "endings." As adventurers, your goal is to reach Dio's bedroom. There will be plenty of obstacles and puzzles along the way and even a few branching paths. Your experience will be a bit different every time, and there is plenty incentive to wander through Dio's halls multiple times, as you can select either the "Jotaro ending" or "Dio ending" beforehand. Your selection determines the special souvenir photo cards you'll receive at the end of the attraction. There will be two additional minigames to play -- "Gekisou! F-MEGA Dice Boost" and "Could Telence really 'ora ora?!'" The prizes upon completing these games feature goods decked out with everyone's favorite uh, cherry boy, Kakyoin. It certainly wouldn't be like J-World to not introduce a couple of themed food and drink items to the menu as well. Take a look at some of the delicious, albeit perhaps a little awkward to eat treats that await you. The Araki tradition of treating dogs terribly has crept into this innocent little event as well because I really want to devour that Iggy... I just hope that you are actually able to sit down inside the mansion for the feast. The Dio's Mansion event will run from February 2 until April 22. The separate admission fee for the attraction is 1000 yen (about $9 USD). If you decide to make the trip, make sure that you are decked out in your new Glamb JoJo collab fit. You're sure to turn a few heads as the strongest fan in the whole of the park.

12751|2018-01-30|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/mcdonalds-japan-fourlayer-cheeseburger/| News | N/A | I Survived McDonald's Japan-Only Four-Layer Cheeseburger | If the relatively simple double cheeseburger wasn't enough for you, McDonald's Japan has come out full force with their four-layer cheeseburger dubbed the "dabudabuchi" |For better or worse, I've got a habit of signing myself up to do really, really stupid tasks. This time unlike in the past, however, I might have taken that stupidity a little too far. If there's any one thing that McDonald's Japan is good at, it's running larger-than-life campaigns with their food. Last year we saw the Mega Size menu, which offered us enough fries for a family in a single package amongst other oversized foods. This year was kicked off in a similar fashion, this time taking aim at the iconic cheeseburger. It all started off earlier this month with the "DabuChi" (Double Cheeseburger) and "ToriChi" (Triple Cheeseburger) availability on the menu. The limited-time campaign was a bit of harmless fun, even though that ToriChi was absolutely a beast worthy of its own category. It was as that campaign was coming to a close, however, that McDonald's Japan decided to unleash something truly, genuinely painful. The "DabuDabuChi" (Double Double Cheeseburger), McDonald's latest limited-time item, is the embodiment of ridiculousness wrapped and served at the price of 420 yen. "Even when the burger isn't in front of you anymore, it's physically there with you existing ever-presently inside of you." There's always room for mistakes in your life, and this one definitely took up a whole lot of that room. Today I put myself through the sluggish nightmare that was the "DabuDabuChi" just so you wouldn't have to, and I lived(?) to tell the tale. From the very beginning, it was abundantly clear I had made a mistake. Whether it was the stream of oil that shot out when I unwrapped the burger or the fact I could see my own reflection on the golden buns that tipped me off is unclear, but I could definitely tell this wasn't a good idea. Getting straight into it, this isn't your ordinary meal. With a total of four pieces of meat and two pieces of cheese, every bite is a grease explosion in your mouth -- something that doesn't feel too good shortly after. Even when the burger isn't in front of you anymore, it's physically there with you existing ever-presently inside of you. Even some 12 hours after eating the monstrosity, I'm still reeling in from the aftereffects. If you were stumbling around Japan and saw promotions for this burger and wondered to yourself if you should challenge it, I would plead you not to do so. Thankfully the burger isn't here to stay and is expected to be removed from McDonald's Japan's menu on February 6, 2018. If you're for some reason wanting to try it, however, all I can share is my warning -- don't do it. For further information on the burger, and just what it's putting inside of you, McDonald's Japan has set up a webpage with all the nutritional information you could need.|McDonald's Japan, Dabudabuchi, Four-Layer Cheeseburger
12747|2018-01-30|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/pop-team-epic-manga-to-anime/| News | Anime , Manga | How Pop Team Epic Went From 4-Panel Manga to Anime Royalty | When Pop Team Epic's first manga volume was released late-2015 in Bamboo Comics Win Selection, it would have been impossible to imagine the level of success it would spawn. |When Bkub Okawa had the first volume of surreal 4-panel manga series Pop Team Epic published in Bamboo Comics Win Selection during late-2015, it would have been near impossible to imagine the level of success the series would attain. Now, a little over two years later, Pop Team Epic is destroying charts and topping fan opinions both inside and outside of Japan -- so what happened? To understand this, there's definitely a few other details you'll need to know first. When it comes to marketing any series in Japan, a solid brand is everything. Following closely after that is having a backer that will guarantee your voice is heard, and for Pop Team Epic, they had both. If people didn't know about the original 4-panel series, they absolutely used or had seen the Pop Team Epic Line stamps, the go-to messaging app in Japan. For many over here, the original content was irrelevant, it was all about the branding of both Popuko and Pipimi and their outstretched middle fingers that were so easily identifiable. "Pop Team Epic has become almost as identifiable as franchises like The Simpsons here in Japan," It didn't take long for King Records to get involved in the series, and that's when things really started to pick up. Suddenly it went from well-known inside joke to cultural phenomenon -- something quite ironic for a series that frequently pits itself against pop cultural norms. Whether it was your local arcade, anime store, or even the streets of Tokyo, nowhere was safe from the exposure of Pop Team Epic. The series was the perfect mix of quirky and accessible, often utilizing a number of outlandish skits to throw readers off their guard. It had the formula for success in its grasp. On January 7, 2018, this success was taken to all new heights, and that was due in no small part to the release of the Pop Team Epic anime series. Pulling no punches, the anime went straight after the big players, lampooning both your name. and Kemono Friends within a space of 10 minutes, all while tossing in a number of other incredible skits. Viewers were sold, and Pop Team Epic rapidly became one of the hottest topics in Anime around the globe. From an outside perspective, it'd be easy to view Pop Team Epic as a throwaway series filled with short gags and parodies of already popular anime. Take a step back though, and you'll see that Pop Team Epic has become almost as identifiable as franchises like The Simpsons here in Japan, even without knowing about the anime or original comic existence. Just take a look at images that surfaced after a Popuko mask giveaway in Akiharaba last week (fitting to know that the tweet itself is from an emergency services account that only tweets when a disaster occurs): ポプテピピック秋葉原お面配布 人集まりすぎで警察指導が入り配布中止に 中指立てブーイングの嵐 https://t.co/XcjWDtpiA8 pic.twitter.com/7i9dXjuzXK — 災害ニュース (@zagimu) 21 January 2018 So while Pop Team Epic is enjoying a large amount of excitement online, saying the series is somewhat of a phenomenon definitely isn't an overstatement. Where Bkub Okawa decides to go from here remains somewhat of a mystery, but until we find out we've got one of the freshest anime in some time to enjoy. If you're yet to check out Pop Team Epic, the series is available for streaming on Crunchyroll and is a must see this season.

With the release of Monster Hunter: Freedom on PlayStation Portable in 2005, there wasn't a single place you could look without seeing groups of friends hunting in new and exciting ways. Even with this success here in Japan though, it would be a long-shot to say it was anywhere close to replicated in the West -- until now. On January 26 the highly-anticipated Monster Hunter: World was released worldwide on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, a first for the action-RPG series. It took only three days for worldwide sales to reach 5 million both physically and digitally, whereas the previous best-selling title in the franchise Monster Hunter Portable 3rd only celebrated a total 4.8 million lifetime sales; that's seriously insane. The announcement came by way of Capcom, in which they shared that the game had broken a number of internal records. What is perhaps most exciting, however, is that the success of the game isn't simply limited to Japan. With a series-first simultaneous worldwide release, we're seeing news that Monster Hunter: World is currently the best-selling title in the UK, beating out Dragon Ball FighterZ in first-week sales. A quick look at the US PlayStation Store also shows that the title is holding both #1 and #2 slots in both standard and deluxe edition releases. While the numbers are definitely impressive, it's likely only going to keep increasing. With a PC release of the game slated for a Fall 2018 release, we're likely to witness yet another boom in sales as eager enthusiasts lunge into the world of Monster Hunter and begin questing. It's exciting to see the title met with such success globally, and we'll be sure to keep you updated with further information as it's revealed.

And when that former Studio Ghibli staff member is serving as the character designer on your RPG, it's probably safe to assume that your game's actors and story direction are in the right hands. Yoshiyuki Momose sat down for an interview posted on PlayStation's YouTube channel to talk about the various challenges and experiences he had while bringing the characters of Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom to life, and shares some insights on the particular challenges presented by game development as opposed to those found in creating a movie. In the video, Momose talks about the challenges of bringing cel-shaded characters to life in a 3D game. Even though they may have a flat appearance at first glance, they have to pop with life and convince the player that they are a living, breathing entity within the world of the game with personalities that are convincing enough to draw you into their plight. Story director Akihiro Hino and game director Takafumi Koukami also add in their comments, and it all makes for a fascinating look at how a Studio Ghibli veteran approaches the job of game development, which he also admits is quite the different experience from anything else he has worked on in the past. I also love just how relaxed he appears in the video -- this is a guy who knows exactly how to bring a story to life with its characters, and it really shows within the footage of the game we've seen so far. Even after many delays, I'm thrilled to finally get the chance to play Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom when it launches for the PlayStation 4 on March 23. You also cannot miss that soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi for anything.

They're the developers behind titles such as Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, amongst a wide variety of other major names in the gaming world. Each year in an attempt to make sure their business strategy aligns with the desires of fans, they host a public survey that ranges across a large number of topics including games, ports, and other forms of media. This year we find the survey full of the usual questions, with a few pieces, in particular, catching the attention of followers. Thanks to the team over at Siliconera, we're able to share those with you: Q55: If a Persona game listed below were to be announced, would you play them? If so, please tell us which device you’d like for it (PS4/PS VR/PS Vita/Switch/Smartphone/PC/Other) Persona Series Shooting Game Persona 5 Fighter Persona 6 Persona Series Strategy Game Persona Series Action RPG Persona Series Board Game Persona Series Online RPG While it might seem obvious to see titles such as Persona 6 in there, especially given the runaway success of last year's Persona 5, it is assuring to see it's on the table. Following that, we're also getting a bit of insight into the other ideas that the team at Atlus are throwing around; some of which including a shooting game in the Persona universe, another fighter, an action RPG, and even an MMO. While it might be a little farfetched, it sure would be incredible to see a mainline Persona title available on the Switch. Q60: If Atlus were to do a full remake of a past title, would you play them? If so, please tell us which device you’d like like for it (PS4/PS VR/PS Vita/Switch/Smartphone/PC/Other) Megami Ibunroku Persona Remake Persona 2 Innocent Sin/Eternal Punishment Remake Persona 3 Remake Persona 4 Remake Persona 5 Remake Shin Megami Tensei: Nine Remake Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Remake Shin Megami Tensei IV Remake Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse Remake Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga Remake Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers Remake Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army Remake Etrian Odyssey main-numbered Title Remake Devil Summoner Series Title Remake Devil Survivor Series Title Remake This could definitely prove interesting, especially in wake of a new wave of fans flocking to the various franchises after a string of incredible releases on all fronts. It would also open up an opportunity to see the games on new consoles, including PC and Switch, though I wouldn't exactly expect to see a Persona 5 remake anytime soon. Q64: Should a main-numbered title be released for the series below, which device you’d like like for it (PS4/PS VR/PS Vita/Switch/Smartphone/PC/Other) Persona Series Etrian Odyssey Series Shin Megami Tensei Series Finally, this is where things get a little specific -- and even a bit exciting. It's definitely straightforward where they're going with this, and the message is ultimately pretty clear. It would seem that there's internal talk at Atlus, or even just ideas being thrown around, that one of their major series should break away from the current console restrictions it's held by. For Persona, you'll only ever find a main-numbered release on PlayStation devices, as with Shin Megami Tensei only being found on Nintendo devices. What this all actually means for the year 2018 and Atlus remains to be shown, but it's definitely a good look into the ideas they're throwing around internally. There's a lot of things to be excited about, especially the concept of a main-numbered Persona release on the Nintendo Switch. If you're interested in checking out the survey, you'll need to be quite brushed up on your Japanese, but otherwise, it can be found here.

Almost forty years after it first launched, we're constantly seeing the world evolve and spark new life into the franchise. Whether that be the recently finished Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans, the currently releasing Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin, or the upcoming free to play PlayStation 4 title Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2, there's a whole universe to explore.

It's a trend that's really started blooming over the past few years, and if there was ever a pop culture icon that deserved to make the roster, it would most definitely have to be Hirohiko Araki's legendary JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Made in collaboration with Japan-based fashion brand Glamb, the collection takes a deep-dive into the grunge inspirations of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series. Every piece in the collection finds itself stemmed from the phenomenal third part of the JJBA story, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders and the characters that inhabited its pages. Spread out across 14 jaw-dropping pieces, the whole collection is definitely a look from start to finish. Not to say I'm too surprised, but there's definitely more than a couple of pieces I'm rearing to pick up when they finally drop during the month of February. With the concept of "Grunge for Luxury" at the foundation of everything they make, there's definitely a whole lot to say about the work of Glamb. Interested in checking out even more? You'll definitely want to head over to the official webpage set up by the team at Glamb. This collection is going to hit the streets of Tokyo hard, that much is for sure.

It was simple, yet had it's own little charm to it -- after all, this was a Nintendo title we're talking about. But as that first week passed, a bit of that magic went with it, with most people moving on from the title to other ventures. I'm talking of course about Miitomo, Nintendo's first ever mobile-oriented app, which is set to shut down in just a few short months. For Nintendo, it's uncertain whether or not their intention was ever to keep Miitomo running as a long-term project. The social hub of sorts was run by the quirky little Mii characters that we all crafted, as we worked to ensure they were the most stylish of our social group. As time passed, however, players were lured away by the likings of other Nintendo-released titles such as Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing, both of which still command a loyal player base. With a solid shutdown date locked in for May 9, 2018, players will find themselves unable to complete in-app purchases today, with all remaining coins set to be refunded by shutdown date. It's unlikely that we'll ever see the Miitomo name again, especially with the likeness of Mii's missing from Nintendo's latest hybrid console, the Nintendo Switch. Note: Upon going to embed the launch trailer for the game in the article, it appears that Nintendo has removed it from their official channels. |Nintendo, Miitomo, Nintendo Mobile, Nintendo app, Nintendo Smartphone
12724|2018-01-25|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/certain-magical-virtual-on/| News | Anime , Games | 'A Certain Magical' Mecha Romp is Coming Soon | This crossover seems to be the perfect excuse to give SEGA's venerable mech battle franchise a shot. |The Virtual-On franchise is not necessarily a well-known one among Western gamers. Having received two relatively obscure releases on both the SEGA Saturn in 1996 and the SEGA Dreamcast in 2000, the franchise built up a secure cult-like following. With the release of Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Marz on the PlayStation 2 in 2003, the prospects of the franchise ever growing into a hit diminished even further, as the title was notoriously terrible. Fast-forward fifteen years, and the series is getting a new lease on life which is sure to make waves in Japan due in no small part to an awesome crossover. Will that success translate to the West? I'm not even convinced the game will make its way out of Japan, again due in no small part to a "certain" crossover. The magic-infused futuristic world of the A Certain Magical Index series seems like a shoe-in for the arena-based mecha combat of Virtual-On, if the above trailer is anything to go by. Mikoto Misaka's Raiden unit belongs to the "Judge Igniters" class, along with Kuroko's unit. Of course, this robot wouldn't be worthy of its pilot of it didn't have some sort of railgun-like super move, so look forward to taking down opponents with that. The game will feature some of the most popular characters from the Raildex franchise, including Touma Kamijou, Index, Accelerator, Misaki Shokuho, Ruiko Saten and Kazari Uiharu. Take a peek at a game overview trailer, as well as the Kuroko character trailer below. Of course, the tricky issue of licensing this game for release outside of Japan remains. I daresay that it is not impossible -- the Raildex anime, light novel, and manga releases all have stakeholders and publishers overseas. Even Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax which featured myriad Dengeki Bunko properties and characters was able to clinch an American release, so I don't see any huge roadblocks in the way for this title. All that really remains up in the air at this point is SEGA's willingness to give the franchise another chance in the West and perhaps calls from fans to see their favorite characters beat the heck out of each other in what is looking to be one of the most fun mecha-based fighters in recent years.

While in the past the two may have been mutually exclusive, we've seen some genuinely incredible works from the likes of creators small and large. Gaming and Anime fashion is no longer just an all-over print of any given character or a poorly-printed series logo chucked on a shirt -- there are real considerations going into design choices now, and that rules. The latest to prove this movements reality is none other than gaming giant PlayStation. In a recently announced collaboration between PlayStation, Nike, and NBA All-Star gone designer Paul George, fans are treated to an all-new PlayStation-themed colorway for to PG-2 sneaker. Featuring LED-fitted sneaker tongues with both the PlayStation and Paul George logo, custom colors reminiscent of the PlayStation controller's buttons, and a seriously sleek design, these are definitely going to be sneakers worth keeping your eye on.

12722|2018-01-24|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/saint-young-men-announcement/| News | Anime | 'Saint Young Men' Series to Receive Special Announcement | The much-wanted, highly-controversial 'Saint Young Men' series is set to receive a new announcement in February via Kodansha's Morning Two magazine. |If there was ever a series I was more desperate to get my hands on in a physical, English-language copy, that'd most definitely have to be Saint Young Men, a Japanese manga series revolving around the lives of a fictional depiction of both Jesus and Buddha. It's a comedy series that, in many ways, seems like it would touch a lot of soft spots of mine when it comes to the things I enjoy, while also keeping me interested in the overarching story. That's a shame, however, especially with the way the series is handled in English-speaking countries. Not sure what I mean? Let me break it down for you: Series I'll never get my hands on: Saint Young Men Series I wish I could get my hands on: Saint Young Men Due to the controversial nature of a manga series that depicts both Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha sharing an apartment space in Tokyo, the likelihood of such a series getting an official translation and release is, unfortunately, very low. With that being said, however, we can at least take refuge in the knowledge that the series is set to receive some special news in the way of an announcement made in the upcoming February 22 issue of Kodansha's Morning Two magazine. While it's unknown just what this entails, there are definitely some reasons to be excited. With an upcoming live-action adaptation of the manga, I'm sure we can't be too far away from more people picking up on the series sparking further consideration from the industry in the West. Until that moment, however, we've got the 22nd to look forward to in the way of news for the series. With a release in just about every language but English, let's see how much longer we have to wait.|Saint Young Men, Kodansha, Morning Two, SYM, Jesus Manga, Buddha Manga

After a recent run through of the previous five parts to the ORIGIN series, I don't think there are many other franchises I've found myself more (re)attached to than that of Mobile Suit Gundam. Let's get into that a little more after you check out the trailer, however: Set to open here in Japan on May 5, 2018, there's definitely a number of things to look forward to in the cinematic adventure. While the previous entries into the ORIGIN series have provided insight into the upbringing of Char, this truly seems to be the first time where we find more than a handful of well-known faces gracing the screen. In Rise of the Red Comet, we find ourselves following Char as he rises through the Zeon ranks to earn the title of Red Comet, while further building on the franchise that I hold so dearly. While following the rise of Char through the ranks, the film will also closely follow the launch and early stages of the Federation's "Project V," which would eventually go on to introduce the original RX-78-2 Gundam unit of the original series. With just a few months to go until I'm finally able to enjoy the animated spectacular on the big screen, there's definitely high-levels of excitement building. Until then, however, I'll continue working on the seemingly endless amount of Gunpla units I've amassed -- sigh. |Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam, Gundam Origin, Red Comet, Char, MSG, MSG Origin
12714|2018-01-23|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/yuji-naka-square-enix/| News | Games | The Father of 'Sonic the Hedgehog' Has Joined Square Enix | This probably won't result in any sort of cameo appearance in new 'Final Fantasy' titles. |inYou may know him as the Father of Sonic the Hedgehog, but did you know that Yuji Naka has done so much more during his time at SEGA and even after his departure in 2006? After co-creating the attitude-wielding hedgehog alongside fellow SEGA employees Hirokazu Yasuhara and Naoto Ooshima, Naka would go on to preside over a number of incredible titles including Alex the Kidd, Phantasy Star, Nights into Dreams and many other fan-favorites. He founded his own game studio Prope in 2006, a group perhaps best known for their Wii and WiiU title Rodea the Sky Soldier. With all that behind him, it seem's Naka is about to embark on a brand-new chapter in his storied career. In the way of an announcement shared via Twitter, followers discovered that monolith game studio, Square Enix, who just so happen to be riding a massive wave of success after a flurry of hit titles, including the recent addition to the Final Fantasy universe. Just a quick note to let you know, I joined SQUARE ENIX in January. I’m joining game development as before, and strive to develop games at SQUARE ENIX. I aim to develop an enjoyable game, please look forward to it. — Yuji Naka / 中 裕司 (@nakayuji) January 22, 2018 As of now, it is unknown what is to become of his own studio Prope, but in any case, it seems safe to assume that Naka is within safe hands within the realm of one of Japan's most successful developers at this point in time. After giving Yoko Taro the free range to create the massively-successful Nier Automata, I can't imagine that there will be too strict of a set of restrictions placed on one of the game industry's leading visionaries. Naka follows the likes of other prolific Japanese game creators who have drastically shaken-up their surroundings. Hideo Kojima famously left Konami in 2015 to start his own studio, and Koji Igarashi has found measurable success with a Kickstarter funding his Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night project, a spiritual successor to the Castlevania style he pioneered with Symphony of the Night.|Sonic the Hedgehog, Square Enix, Final Fantasy, Games, Gaming, Video Games

Yes, the games now have a sizable enough roster to warrant such a poll; remember when Calamity Trigger sported only a paltry twelve member team? You can now chalk that up to thirty-six, and commiserate in the impossible task of choosing your favorites. With the polls officially closing on January 31, you have but 7 more days (in Japan time) to cast your vote. ArcSys has reported that as of January 11 from a total of 58,550 votes, the ranking stands as such: Ragna the Bloodedge – 5,029 votes Hazama – 3,752 votes Yuuki Terumi – 3,328 votes Jin Kisaragi – 3,268 votes Hibiki Kohaku – 3,202 votes Mai Natsume – 2,553 votes Noel Vermillion – 2,443 votes Celica A. Mercury – 2,284 votes Nu-13 – 2,027 votes Es – 1,943 votes Ragna leading that pack by a modest 1277 votes? Whoever said that a little edge ever hurt anyone? Is the Wheel of Fate turning in your desired direction? If not, you'd better step on it and convince your other fighting game frenemies to do the same! Remember, all you have to do is click the blue '投票' and confirm, right on this page! Again, it remains to be seen what exactly ArcSys is going to do with the poll results, though with so much more information having been revealed on that insane four franchise crossover game BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle, it's even harder to say if that poll will have any impact on this title. I just think that it's super-appropriate that the poll is being conducted during EVO Japan as well. With companies like ArcSys continuing to offer such robust anime fighter experiences, it's doubtful this scene will be hibernating anytime soon.|BlazBlue, Arc System Works, Evo Japan, Fighting Games, Games, Gaming, Video Games

In the game, players will be able to play along with Hatsune Miku to eight songs using their two motion controllers. While it's still yet to be known what the initial eight songs available for play will be, it has been confirmed that more will be added at a later date. The game will also feature two levels of difficulty, though as someone who enjoys a challenge in rhythm games, I can only hope this means that one of the two will blow me away. Those interested in checking out more can visit the official website which is available in both Japanese and English. It's been about 8 years since I first discovered Hatsune Miku through my various ventures online. Throughout those years, I've witnessed a total shift in the way that people not only listen to Hatsune Miku's music but also the ways in which they interact with the virtual idol. From a slew of fan-made album releases to a number of official video games released on both PlayStation, Nintendo, and even Arcade devices, the blue-haired character is basically everywhere.

12699|2018-01-21|12:00|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/shibuya-guhroovy-closing/| News | N/A | Shibuya GUHROOVY Shop Announces Closure | Underground hardcore mainstain, GUHROOVY, announced today that they're closing at the end of January. |For many fans of the Japanese underground hardcore scene, (often referred to as J-Core by international fans) the mainstay location of Shibuya's GUHROOVY has played a critical role in the scene for over 20 years. Home to hardcore pioneers such as DJ CHUCKY and M-Project, as well as organizers of the yearly DAY OF HARDCORE party, GUHROOVY has done an endless amount of work to promote the movement both in Japan and overseas. That's why today's news that their physical location in Shibuya (located just off of Center-Gai along near R-Lounge and HMV) is closing comes as not only a shock but also a massive blow to the long-standing DIY hardcore scene. いつもご愛顧いただき、ありがとうございます。 このたび、弊社業態変更に伴いGUHROOVY渋谷実店舗は、2018年1月31日(水)21時をもちまして閉店する運びとなりました。 尚、ネットショップ・通信販売はこれまで通り営業していきますので、引き続きのご利用どうぞ宜しくお願い致します。 GUHROOVY一同 — GUHROOVY (@guhroovy) 21 January 2018 Known by fans in the Japanese scene as one of the best locations to simply walk in and pick up the latest hardcore and underground electronic releases in all of Tokyo, GUHROOVY's closure is a sign of the direction that the music industry has been moving in. The past several years have been really tough for physical medium retailers all over the world, including Japan (which is known for its supportive music listening culture) and small retailers such as GUHROOVY simply can't maintain a physical presence in this digitally & web-dominated world. While they have continued being the home of new releases in light of the rough climate, shop manager DJ CHUCKY mentioned to me the other day during a quick visit that the decision to close their flagship shop was a "difficult" one. Fans who still need to catch up on the most recent releases from Comiket can still place orders through their online shop for the time being, but even that business is going to wrap up operations in the near future. Members of GUHROOVY's crew will still continue work as live DJs and producers, and their activity in the scene isn't likely to wrap up anytime soon, but if you're a fan and currently in the Tokyo area you owe it to yourself to make a stop in before they cease physical operation. As a long time friend of the entire GUHROOVY crew and fan of their works, this strikes me as a huge loss in a niche/underground movement. I sincerely hope for the best for all members of their crew, and expect to see them pop up in the United States in 2018 and beyond so be sure to give them a follow on social media and keep your eyes out!|

If you're a classic anime fan, then you've probably encountered his scores for Vampire Hunter D or Street Fighter II: The Animation. At the very least, you've probably heard the iconic track "Get Wild" from his band TM Network. He's a man who many consider a legend in the industry, with seemingly endless accomplishments such as holding the top 5 spots on the Japanese Oricon rankings chart simultaneously. His career has spanned decades, even being an active producer and songwriter in recent years. That's why when he announced his retirement earlier today, many fans were not only shocked but also deeply upset by the turn of events. To understand the situation fully is to understand Japan's compliance based culture, something that has impacted J-Pop for many years. Compliance in this situation is in reference to the extreme measures artists will take to apologize for scandals that pop up in their careers, often related to infidelity or hiding relationships that could potentially damage their image in relation to their work. Readers in America might remember when AKB48 member Minami Minegishi shaved her head as an apology for being caught spending the night with her boyfriend, an act that was not allowed per the rules of her membership in the band. In relation to Komuro, the reason for his sudden retirement announcement all revolves around a notorious publication, Shukan Bunshun. Bunshun has often been at the center of these kinds of scandals, having impacted artists like the previously mentioned Minegishi as well as music and television personality BECKY in high profile situations. In Komuro's case, Bunshun recently broke a scoop claiming that he was having an affair with a nurse he met while his wife, Globe vocalist KEIKO, was in a long recovery for a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It was reported that the nurse began visiting his home to provide private treatment after they met during a routine clinic visit. An official statement regarding the matter was released upon the news breaking: I apologize to stakeholders and fans for creating a disturbance due to the recent story. In order to make things right and take responsibility, I have decided to retire. I would like to deeply thank the fans who have supported me for 35 years, I would also like to thank my staff for their ongoing support. Although I am retiring I will take full responsibility and complete in progress projects. Once again, thank you for supporting me, Tetsuya Komuro, for such a long period of time. He also gave a 40-minute statement at a press conference in which he addressed the report, as well as difficulty of the situation. In response to reports of adultery I have decided to retire. I apologize to my wife KEIKO, my fans, and others affected by this news. I don't think that one man's word will change society, but I think this is a chance to address how Japan is becoming a more complex society, as well as how difficult nursing and caring for people is in this society. By addressing that I hope that people will be more conscious of the difficult times facing others and that our society improves. I hope for any kind of consideration for those people. Thank you very much. In the interview, Komuro also claims that he was not in a relationship with the nurse. This has caused many in Japan to feel that his response is not necessary and that society has taken this need to take extreme measures to apologize too far. The hashtag "文春を許さない" (Never Forgive Bunshun) was trending on Twitter, and the response from friends of mine I've spoken to about the situation have expressed an extreme disdain for the way these kind of events have negatively impacted or ended the careers of so many talented people over the years. In this case, Komuro's legacy is so huge that it's hard to ignore and really creating a lot of conversation. Even out in public, every train with televised news playing and even large screens in both Akihabara and Shibuya were broadcasting this story. The impact really cannot be overstated. The situation is also incredibly hard to compare to anything in Western culture. Scandals with celebrities are so commonplace, and this kind of response is almost unheard of for something on the same level. We didn't even see this kind of extremely formal response from Harvey Weinstein in light of his recent outing for his treatment of women and abusing his power in Hollywood, and that's the kind of thing that has given birth to an entire movement in our country. As a foreigner looking at Komuro's case, even if he is guilty of committing adultery the response feels quite extreme. A public apology is one thing, but for him to retire outright is almost like admitting guilt and giving himself life in prison. It begs the question, "how far is too far"? Regardless of your stance on the issue, this is a major loss and a massive impact to the Japanese music industry. And with any luck, it could the kind of turning point that creates a positive shockwave across the entertainment business and even society. Japanese culture is deeply ingrained with a sense of pride and responsibility, and it's something that I've come to really respect in my time working with talent over here and during my visits. But at that same time, if the impact of that aspect leads to events like these maybe there is a level of it that needs to evolve and become a little more forgiving. We here at OTAQUEST wish Mr. Komuro the best and hope that this isn't truly the end.|

The collection features 4 tops and several accessories at a variety of colorways with a look that perfectly captures the essence of the franchise while blending Listen Flavor's trademark pastel color palette. The prices range from 4,900jpy to 7,900jpy for each of the tops and they'll be available on February 10th with pre-orders currently running on their online store. Their Ranma 1/2 collaboration last year made waves and sold out very quickly, so you definitely don't want to sleep on this.

12695|2018-01-19|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/granblue-ps4/| News | Games | Platinum and Cygames' 'Granblue Fantasy' Gets a Lengthy PV | We finally have a concise look at the highly-anticipated 3D take on Cygames' 'Granblue Fantasy.' |Granblue Fantasy is just one of many mobile gaming phenomena to hit the Japanese market in recent years, and the Cygames-developed RPG is about to hit the PS4 in a new and gorgeous way with the Cygames and Platinum Games jointly-developed Granblue Fantasy Project Re:LINK. The newest preview video released by Cygames today is one of the lengthiest in-depth looks we've received at the game so far. It begins by showing off some town-based exploration gameplay and thrusts us into an exciting look at the game's action-RPG style combat and instantly-familiar UI design elements. Give it a watch below. What has me most pumped about this release is perhaps how well art director Hideo Manaba and CyDesign's characters have transitioned to the 3D plane. In the first segment of the video, when Katalina is strolling around the town, I couldn't help but notice how satisfying it is to see her realistically-proportioned, armor-clad model go clink-clank around the village. When the kids run by her laughing and their eyes meet, I knew right away that Platinum's 3D artists were putting forth their best. The combat looks equally as satisfying and as fun as ever for a Platinum title, so I have no concerns in that department. Nobuo Uematsu's score remains a pitch-perfect fit for this luscious fantasy world As the game has retained many of the familiar design elements and maintains the smartphone game's gorgeous character portraits, I have no doubt in my mind that Re:LINK is shaping up to be a worthy entry into the Granblue Fantasy canon. It will be released in Japan sometime this year, but nothing beyond has been set in stone quite yet.

He's the genius behind the intense production value of artists like Suiyobi no Campanella, Capeson, and a number of other artists. Here in Japan, he's been making some pretty big strides, and he's got the recent signing to Sony Music Japan to prove it. On top of that, Obukuro also has an upcoming debut major album which is being co-produced by the one and only Utada Hikaru. With the album not too far away from hitting shelves here in Japan, we're finally starting to get a glimpse of the artist's entry into the major circuit. Through the electronic-sprinkled "Lonely One," which features co-producer Utada Hikaru herself, we're given insight into an album that's absolutely jumped onto my personal list of albums to look forward to in 2018. Not sure why? Check out the stream of "Lonely One" below: With hard-hitting snares and kicks riding throughout the opening of the song, melding perfectly with Nariaki Obukuro's gentle vocals which comprise much of the track, we're taken on a journey through the mind of both Obukuro and Hikaru. It's around the two-minute mark that we are first presented with Utada Hikaru's powerful lyrical work as it seemingly bursts through the foundations laid before it. Set to release in Japan on April 25 via Sony Music Japan, "Bunriha no Natsu" could be one of my most valued albums of the year, something that I'm very much content with. Let's see what else both Nariaki Obukuro and Utada Hikaru are able to bring to the table across the album's total 14 tracks.

With a total of over 2 million downloads on both Android and iPhone devices, it’d be a total understatement to consider the Western release of the game a success. The game's success, however, comes as little surprise; having already conquered the smartphone game landscape here in Japan, Fate/Grand Order could do nothing but perform well internationally. Players of the game will be able to log-on to some pretty great rewards for their support, as well as a six-part campaign consisting of daily log-on bonuses, summon tickets, craft essence, and a brand new Mystic Code based on Altria Pendragon’s casual wear look in Fate/stay night. On top of this, there’s also slated to be a new 5-star SSR Lancer-class Servant named Brynhild, a figure set to be the most beautiful Valkyrie within all of Norse mythology.

Not only was the content that was crammed into those 12 months genuinely awe-inspiring, but we also saw a lot of positive development in the way the industry operates and acts as a whole. We saw anime once again rise to the forefront of attention through the cinematic likes of “your name.,” and the rippling effect that would have world-round. Each year Crunchyroll takes the opportunity to reflect on the year that was, and hands control over to the community to vote for what they believe the best anime was in any number of topics. From “Best CGI” to “Best Action” and even “Best Boy,” the anime community as a whole are given a chance to have their voice heard. This year is no different, and we see the return of the awards show in a new and improved form following feedback from last year. With a panel of 12 industry veterans casting their votes for “Anime of the Year,” we can’t wait to see who comes out on top.

It was the quirky, hyper-colorful rollercoaster of a journey into the streets of Harajuku that we all embarked on last season, and we’re invited to take part once more in just a couple of months. From the real streets of Harajuku to the pages of PARK Harajuku: Crisis Team and then onto our screens in URAHARA, it’s been a wild ride from start to finish. It was revealed some time ago that the anime would be coming out in a complete DVD/Blu-Ray collection, though we were yet to see just what it would look like at that time. By way of the cover designer and frequent person of interest here at OTAQUEST, GraphersRock, we’re finally able to bask in all of the glory it offers. Designed for URAHARA DVD Package. A post shared by GraphersRock / Tamio Iwaya (@graphersrock) on Jan 17, 2018 at 7:31pm PST For those of you who might not be familiar with GraphersRock, he’s the genius mind behind some of our most hyped fashion drops, the album covers for Tofubeats, a number of the graphic designs for idol group Dempagumi.inc, and any number of our favorite creative pieces. In his work on the URAHARA package design, he smashed together his signature net-age style with the characters of the series, glitching and mashing them to create one of the most visually intense designs I’ve ever seen. I mentioned earlier my affinity towards the series for cultivating everything I enjoy, and the inclusion of GraphersRock is only the surface. For many, I’m sure URAHARA felt like a nice tidbit to Harajuku culture as a whole; but sprinkled throughout were moments of personal recognition to those who helped form the Harajuku seen by those involved in the creation of the original series. Through gestures like the end cards featuring art by frequent collaborators at PARK, the inclusion of neat little background prompts, and a number of other tools utilized, URAHARA feels like the ultimate love letter to the culture that I enjoy so much. The DVD collection, which is set to release in Japan on March 21, 2018, will be available in both DVD and Blu-Ray formats.

12674|2018-01-18|07:05|Eddie Lehecka|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-labo-revealed/| News | N/A | Nintendo Labo Revealed, A New Level Of Play for the Switch | Nintendo announces "Nintendo Labo", a daring new way to interact with their mega popular Switch console for gamers of all ages. |If there's anything that can be considered true about Nintendo as a company it's that they seem fearless when it comes to pushing boundaries and trying new things in the video game landscape. This morning they proved that truth once again with the announcement of one of the most unique ideas to come from the house that Mario made, Nintendo Labo. Being billed hours before the big reveal as "an interactive experience specifically crafted for kids and those who are kids at heart.", Nintendo Labo is all about taking inteactivity in gaming a step further by giving you the opportunity to help build the experience and discover new methods of play. At first glance it just looks like a lot of cardboard, and that's because it is until you begin constructing what ends up becoming an entirely new way to interact with the Nintendo Switch. The promo video released this morning shows demonstrations of a DIY Piano, fishing pole, robot suit, and even a house that allows you to play a series of different games on the console. The immediate thought I get when I watch this is that it's a brilliant way to allow kids to explore their creativity and natural desire to build and pretend within the confines of a pre-programmed game. The platform not only becomes a new way to play, but a blank canvas that can be colored & customized to the heart's content. What's really intriguing about this system is how far it could potentially go, and what inspiration 3rd parties might take from it. While the initial release of Nintendo Labo is made up of 2 different kits (the "Toy-Con 01: Variety Pack" & "Toy-Con 02: Robot Pack"), the fact that the additional peripherals are made out of cardboard hopefully mean the production has a lower barrier of entry . If they open up the platform to 3rd parties, who knows what kind of things other developers could come up with? It certainly isn't the first time someone has used a piece of cardboard with a Nintendo console to create a different kind of gaming experience, Sega played with a much more simplified idea on the Wii with the Yuji Naka directed title "Let's Tap". While this idea certainly isn't going to excite everyone in the gaming world, I think those who still embrace their inner child and enjoy the exploration of new ideas will find a lot to love in this product. Nintendo Labo is slated to release on April 20th worldwide, starting at $69.99 for the Toy-Con 01: Variety Pack, and $79.99 for the Toy-Con 02: Robot Pack in the United States.|Nintendo, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Labo
12672|2018-01-17|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/mazinger/| News | Anime | 'MAZINGER Z: INFINITY' to Receive Theatrical Release in US | This Japanese sci-fi mainstay is guaranteed to bring you even closer to its esteemed creator and Devilman author Go Nagai. |Go Nagai -- a manga artist practically unrivaled. If you enjoy modern manga and anime tropes, then there is a high possibility that Go Nagai has influenced it in some way. He's credited as being the father of mecha, having designed the first pilotable robots found in manga with Mazinger Z, and is even known as being the pioneer of ecchi, with his bold release of Harenchi Gakuen in the first issue of the now famous Shonen Jump magazine. If there was ever a time for the mangaka's success to be recognized, this is absolutely it. With the recent release of Masaaki Yuasa's anime adaptation of Nagai's classic Devilman series, and the international success that's been met with, it comes as no surprise that people are digging further and further into the creators incredible library of content. With series such as Mazinger Z, Cutie Honey, and Violence Jack all being of extreme significance here in Japan -- amongst a wide variety of other classics, -- there definitely isn't many others quite as worthy of the attention. That's why news that VIZ Media, alongside Fathom Events, would be doing limited screenings of the latest animated film entry into the MAZINGER Z universe was met with such excitmenet from our staff. The film has been long-hyped amongst individuals here in Japan, and we're dying to sink our teeth into the 4DX version out here in Japan in the coming days. For those of you in North America, however, you're going to have a wonderful time checking the film out during it's two-night-only screening on February 11 and 12. Not quite sure what the movie is going to revolve around? Well, check out the information straight from the source -- VIZ Media: Toei Animation Inc. and VIZ Media, LLC (VIZ Media), a premier company in the fields of publishing, animation distribution, and global entertainment licensing, have jointly announced the acquisition of the MAZINGER Z: INFINITY feature film.

It follows our hero, Koji Kabuto, in an action-packed adventure where only he can choose his ultimate path! Ten years ago, the villainous scientist Dr. Hell led his wicked followers, known as the Underground Empire, in a struggle to destroy all of humanity. It was against these forces that the young hero Koji Kabuto fought, piloting the legendary super robot “Mazinger Z.” Koji’s victory stopped Dr. Hell’s evil plan and returned peace to the Earth. Now Koji has left the pilot seat behind and become a scientist in his own right, following in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps. Yet an unexpected encounter deep under Mt. Fuji triggers an even greater threat to mankind than ever before and alters Koji’s destiny forever. With humanity’s fate in their hands, Koji and Mazinger Z face a choice between good…and evil. “MAZINGER Z is one of Japan’s most celebrated sci-fi properties and is an instantly recognizable icon of the super robot genre,” says Masayuki Endo, Toei Animation Inc.’s President & CEO. “We are very pleased to work so closely with VIZ Media to bring this exciting new anime movie to fans across North America.” “Fathom is thrilled to partner with VIZ Media to bring this well-loved franchise to cinema audiences across the U.S.” Fathom Events CEO Ray Nutt said. “Our anime events continue to fill auditoriums with excited fans and we know MAZINGER Z: INFINITY will do the same.” “MAZINGER Z is a groundbreaking property that has helped to define the super robot and mecha genres for over four decades,” says Charlene Ingram, VIZ Media’s Director of Animation Marketing. “The new film is a fitting testament to the enduring popularity of the franchise as well as the iconic works of Go Nagai.

Aniplex USA are cooking up a feast in ‘Today’s MENU for EMIYA Family,’ which is to be streamed on Crunchyroll starting January 2018. |When it comes to series that aren’t going away any time soon, I’d dare suggest that the Fate/ series is pretty high up there. With the success of both Aniplex and Sony’s mobile monolith Fate/Grand Order, and Type-Moon author Nasu’s penchant for creating a character revolving around every significant figure in history, the content is seemingly endless. Well, what if that one of those historical figures turned character was considerably good at cooking? What if that character was the one and only Shirou Emiya? If this was ever something you had wanted, for whatever reason, you're in luck -- Crunchyroll will be airing the entirety of the Today’s MENU for EMIYA Family anime this season, which features a more playful approach to in contrast to the usually-clamorous approach of the Fate/ universe. According to the Aniplex of America press release: Aniplex of America announced on their livestream that they will begin streaming Today’s MENU for EMIYA Family on Crunchyroll beginning January 25th. The series, which originated as a spin-off manga by TAa/TYPE-MOON, will be produced by Fate series dream team, Hikaru Kondo and the prestigious studio ufotable, both credited for the success of Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works], Fate/Zero, and most recent smash hit film,Fate/stay night THE MOVIE [Heaven’s Feel] I. presage flower. Two more heavy hitting veterans within the Fate franchise, Takahiro Miura (Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]) and Tetsuhito Sato (the Garden of sinners, God Eater), will be serving as directors for the series. The series’ character design is by Toko Uchimura, who is well recognized for designing Katsugeki! TOUKEN RANBU main character, Izuminokami Kanesada. A new episode of Today’s MENU for EMIYA Family will be available on the 1st of every month on Crunchyroll with the first episode kicking off on January 25th. A considerably more light-hearted look into the usually serious and dire Fate universe, Today’s MENU for EMIYA Family depicts happier times in Fuyuki city with each episode focusing on protagonist, Emiya Shirou, cooking appetizing meals for those around him. The series also reunites the Fate/stay night series’ popular characters and all-star cast including Noriaki Sugiyama as Shirou Emiya, Ayako Kawasumi as Saber, Kana Ueda as Rin Tohsaka, Noriko Shitaya as Sakura Matou, and Yu Asakawa as Rider. The opening theme is “Apron Boy” by self-proclaimed foodie, hip hop rapper DJ Misoshiru to MC Gohan and ending theme “Collage” is by Sangatsu no Phantasia, who also sings the ending theme for KIZNAIVER. After witnessing the gravity of recent anime outings like ufotable's takes on Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night, this is bound to be quite the refreshing watch. Maybe we can all come to like Shirou again, but who knows?

Following the news that LISA would be retruning to the group and that we could expect subsequent releases, we’ve all been feverishly awaiting any news we could get our hands on — and that time has finally come. With a whole lot to take in, we’ve broken it all down below beginning with their latest single, “No Question”: Reworking the classic m-flo sound that the world came to love, we’re presented with an astromantic launch into the group’s future in “No Question.” The song is the first thing we’ve heard from the newly reformed trio, and it absolutely does not disappoint. I mentioned those gorgeous vocals from LISA earlier, but it really is difficult to put to words the sheer awe they leave us in every time — then matching that sheer intensity is the high-paced flow thrown at listeners by VERBAL. Bringing all of that together is the new-age production value of Taku Takahashi, giving the original m-flo sound a modern feel. Let’s look at the upcoming remix album too, which is set to be something seriously incredible. Calling on some of the greatest talents in Japan’s underground music scene, we’ll be seeing some of m-flo’s biggest hits flipped, screwed and spread out across the “Back 2 the Future” album. I’m not kidding when I say that I was blowing up some inboxes when I saw the lineup, because I couldn’t be any more excited for what’s to come.

It’s the essence of the last 20 years of m-flo, and a beautiful modern take on the sound we fell in love with in the group’s early days. There’s still not too much revealed about it, but so far we do know both “No Question” and “never” have been announced, and will both be receiving their own music videos. The E.P. will come in two forms, both regular and CD + DVD, which gives us a whole lot to look forward to, especially if “No Question” is anything to go by. With the year 2018 already shaping up to be something incredible for m-flo, we’re beyond excited to see what else comes forward. With no sign of slowing down any time soon, with over 20 years of history, the group is back and stronger than ever. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as further information is announced!|m-flo, mflo, taku takahashi, verbal, Lisa, tripod, Tripod EP 2, YUC’e, tofubeats, PCZK, TeddyLoid, banvox, Carpainter, Masayoshi Iimori
12636|2018-01-12|00:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-direct-mini/| News | Games | Today's Nintendo Direct Mini News was Anything But Small | Surprise! A 'Nintendo Direct Mini' has dropped a ton of new Nintendo Switch bombshells. Check out all the news here! |After dropping a few subtle hints via their social media feeds these past few days, Nintendo has dropped a short, approximately 15 minute-long version of one of their fan-favorite 'Nintendo Directs,' which they have dubbed a "Mini" entry. The news contained within was anything but minuscule, however, so let's jump right into the juicy announcements! Cult favorite Nintendo DS RPG The World Ends with You is getting a Switch port, dubbed The World Ends with You: Final Remix. It will feature enhanced graphics for the HD era, updated touch and Joycon control schemes, as well as an extra ending scenario. We're not getting a full-blown sequel anytime soon it seems -- but finally, some closure! New Pokemon fighters are coming to Pokken Tournament DX for Switch. Aegislash and Blastoise are debuting as playable fighters, while Rayquaza, Mimikyu, Mew, and Celebi will take the stage as support characters. The content is releasing in two waves, with Wave 1 coming January 31, and Wave 2 on March 23. More copy abilities have been revealed for Kirby Star Allies, like Spider and Artist. In multiplayer co-op mode, you can share abilities with friends. Wii U fan-favorite Hyrule Warriors is coming to the Switch with all of that system's DLC. The game will also feature new outfits for Link and Zelda modeled after their Breath of the Wild appearances. It will launch this Spring. Mario Tennis Aces is a brand-new Mario sports experience coming to the Switch, and is the first Mario Tennis title to feature a story mode since the days of the Game Boy Advance. It will be available this Spring. NIS is publishing Falcom's YS VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA on the Switch. Let's just hope that it comes with that updated translation patch pre-installed! It will be out this Summer. A free update is coming to Super Mario Odyssey, primarily featuring a new minigame known as "Luigi's Balloon World." It takes advantage of the game's online capabilities to allow you to perform a kind of hide-and-seek minigame with other players. You can hide balloons around the game's various stages, and compete with your friend's times to find their own hidden balloons. Also included in the update will be new outfits for Mario and photo mode filters. It will be hitting the airwaves in February. In what could very well be the most outta-left-field announcement of the whole lot, a new fighter from SNK known as SNK Heroines Tag Team Frenzy will be busting onto the Switch. It features popular SNK heroines from accross their various games, and is presented in the popular tag-team format, allowing you two switch between characters on the fly. Incredibly, you are able to fully-customize your character models with accessories, ala Tekken 7. This is something that has to be seen to be believed. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is adding Donkey Kong as a new playable character via DLC this Spring. When multiplayer co-op shooter Payday 2 comes to the Switch on February 27, it will come with a timed exclusive character, Japanese "computer whiz" Joy. Two positively beautiful indie platformers are coming to the Switch. Moody 3D platformer Fe by Zoink! will debut on the Switch on February 16. 2D sprite action platformer Celeste by Matt Makes Games will launch on January 25. One of the Wii U's best platforming adventures will come to the Switch with a new character in tow. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze will release with Funky Kong, a character who makes the game a bit easier, on May 4. Finally, revealed after Nintendo teased it in the absolute cutest of ways, Dark Souls Remastered will hit the Switch. The punishingly-difficult game will feature 1080p resolution for the first time, and most excitingly, allows for the first time a game in the series can be played in a truly portable way. It will release on May 25. Nintendo tweeted out the below image of adorably petite Chibi Robo yesterday, and some astute fans have quickly pieced together what it all meant. oh for f pic.twitter.com/09LHdyV7CI — Paul Watson (@walnutsoap) January 11, 2018 If you are interested in all of the juicy details, and especially if you want to see footage for every single one of the above games in action, I highly recommend giving the most excellent Nintendo Direct Mini a watch below!

12632|2018-01-10|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/dmatsu-san-spinoff/| News | Anime | The Osomatsu-san Spinoff That You'll Likely Never Sheeeeeeh! | In collaboration with Japanese network provider NTT Docomo and their dTV service, an original twelve episode Osomatsu-san anime series is being produced. |With the development of anime streaming platforms such as Crunchyroll and Netflix, we’re seeing more Japanese content in the West than ever before. Mere minutes after original airings in Japan, eager fans across the globe can log-in to their service of choice and endulge in their favorites of the season. That being said, not everything is able to make it international — something that we could only hope to be fixed over time. Perhaps the gravest example of this as of late would have to be the currently-airing “DMatsu-san,” a collaborative 12-episode short series made exclusively for NTT Docomo’s dTV service in Japan. “DMatsu-san” is slated to be a 12-episode venture split up into six episode cours and released exclusively on dTV, beginning earlier this week on January 9. The first six episodes will revolve around the sextuplets interactions with Totoko, with each sextuplet receiving their own episode. The second half will revolve around each sextuplets interactions with Iyami, again with each sextuplet receiving their own episode. It’s not much of a secret that a majority of our staff are major fans of the “Osomatsu-san” animated series, with some of our staff even referring to the show’s second season as the best thing to happen in 2017. With the second cour of the second season just around the corner, we’re excited for a fresh wave of content in the series’ incredible catalogue. That being said, the knowledge that there’s even more content out there to sink our teeth into is exciting, though for our friends outside of Japan it’s a little different. While there is currently no word of the spinoff being released internationally, we can only hope for fans of the series around the globe that some good news does come their way. For now though, those in Japan with access to dTV can start watching the mishaps of our favorite sextuplets. Images: Docomo|NTT, Docomo, dTB, dTV, Osomatsu, Osomatsu-san, Avex Pictures
12631|2018-01-10|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/polygon-pictures-historia/| News | Anime , Games | Anime Studio Polygon Pictures Teams with Game Dev Historia | The two 3d giants are hoping to usher in a new era for 3DCG with a brand-new company. |If the excitement and love of Studio Orange's 3DCG adaptation of Land of the Lustrous is anything to go by, then anime fans have seemingly warmed-up even more to the idea of entirely 3DCG anime productions. In the world of such media, Polygon Pictures is another studio that has been in the 3DCG game for a while, proudly bolstering projects under their belts including the Netflix exclusive Knights of Sidonia, and even GODZILLA: Planet of the Monsters. When game creators approach 3D game development, a number of pre-built engines are available, allowing them ease of creation and implementation of 3D models and backgrounds. One of the most popular engines out there today is Epic Game's 'Unreal Engine 4,' which is popular with game studios across Japan and the rest of the world. Surely, there must be some room for sharing these assets across a large body of works, right? Both Polygon Pictures and Historia Inc., an Unreal Engine game development specialist, both seem to think so. Citing the fact that 3D computer graphics are used in many different forms of media, including both anime and games, the two companies have revealed that they will form a joint venture company dubbed Elementfactory Inc. It is now common practice for the same content to be rolled out collectively across disparate genres ranging from film and television to games, VR, and events. Additionally, game and video production technologies are being used in fields beyond the entertainment industry, such as education and architecture. Drawing on the game and CG anime production know-how cultivated by its two investing companies, Elementfactory, Inc. will take on the role of producing and developing 3D CG models which allow for efficient reuse across multiple media. In particular, the company will be developing next generation 3D CG models which utilize the globally used game development engine Unreal Engine in various forms. It surely is an interesting idea. Take Polygon Picture's latest, Fist of the Blue Sky REGENESIS, as an example. In addition to the anime, what if accompanying games and even VR experiences could be produced simultaneously at the snap of a finger? Would all of the projects contain the same specifications, making it difficult to tell them apart? Are character models simply going to be exported for use in gaming, so that the developers don't have to painstakingly rebuild their own models? I think that the possibilities are quite endless with collaboration taking place at this level, and if anyone possesses the expertise and is poised to make it work, both Polygon Pictures and Historia seem to be safe bets. Best of luck then to Elementfactory -- we can't wait to see what you bring to the table!

12623|2018-01-09|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/gkids-masaaki-yuasa/| News | Anime | Gkids To Bring Three Masaaki Yuasa Films to North America | North American animation distributor Gkids have acquired the rights to three of Masaaki Yuasa’s films, including ‘Lu Over the Wall,’ ‘Night Is Short, Walk on Girl,’ and ‘Mind Game.’ |North America-based animation distributor Gkids have recently announced the acquisition of three films directed by Japanese heavyweight Masaaki Yuasa. The films, which include “Lu Over the Wall,” “Night Is Short, Walk on Girl,” and “Mind Game,” come at a crucial point in the directors global appeal, with the acquisition offering fans even deeper insight into the mind of the great. With the release of animated-spectacular “DEVILMAN crybaby” on Netflix earlier this month, it feels like now more that ever before Masaaki Yuasa is at the forefront of attention in the international anime community. The director has been the genius behind bringing anime such as “Ping Pong” and “Tatami Galaxy” to life, as well as the aforementioned “DEVILMAN crybaby” adaptation. In 2017 alone he witnessed the release of two feature-length films under his name, both of which are featured in the acquisition. While all three animated films will be distributed in Japanese language with English subtitles, “Lu Over the Wall” is slated to receive an English dub of which will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. With Masaaki Yuasa being a long time favorite director of mine, it’s exciting to see the undeniable recognition he has been receiving as of late. With a directorial style unafraid of stepping away from the norm, it seems everything he touches shines brightly amongst all else. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as further information is revealed.

12613|2018-01-08|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/netflix-devilman-crybaby-violence/| News | Anime | Netflix Offers New Age of Expression in Anime | In the abscense of traditional rules against provocative imagery on television, Netflix offers a new home for expression through animation. |On January 5, 2018, DEVILMAN crybaby was released onto Netflix’s streaming platform around the globe with an R+ rating. The modern adaptation of the 1972 manga series by Go Nagai, a hyper-stylised Masaaki Yuasa directed ONA series produced by Netflix, not only introduced a new wave of anime fans to the story of Akira and his new-found powers, but also to that of the series’ adult themes and violence. For some, it was off-putting — for others, it was ushering in the return of expression through animation. Nothing about DEVILMAN crybaby can be viewed as ordinary, though that can generally be expected from anything Masaaki Yuasa touches. When Yuasa sets his eyes on an adaptation project, you can rest assured that it’ll be as accurate as possible, while polishing a few of the finer details. That’s why when it was announced that he would be directing the modern adaptation of the early 70s manga series, there was understandable levels of excitement — and that’s why when it was announced to be produced and released by Netflix, that excitement only rose among fans. When the original Devilman TV anime series aired in the 70s, it was difficult for it to capture the true reality presented by the manga series. Due to various restrictions on what could be shown on air, it hindered the overwhelming harshness of the source material. In the late 80s, we saw Devilman: The Birth, an OVA which ran for 50 minutes in length, finally capture the intent of the source material. The world of devils and humans isn’t a pretty one, and through its over-the-top violence it truly felt like that was accurately represented. It’s in similar sense that, because of the nature of Netflix not needing to abide by the rules of television thus allowing full creative control by the creators, DEVILMAN crybaby was able to accurately depict the horrors of a world filled with both devils and humans. Making the most of this new age of digital media, we’re offered a glimpse into depictions of adult content previously only available in OVA form. The unhinged nature of DEVILMAN crybaby depicted in scenes like those at SABBATH make for some of the series’ most enticing points, and simply couldn’t exist in the television anime format. Let’s take a look at anime series such as Terra Formars or Tokyo Ghoul, both of which suffered greatly at the hand of censorship, even while violence existed at the core of each story. Between shadows being abused to cover blood, and the tendency to exclude anything of sexual nature, it’s difficult to grasp the true horror of any given scenario in most television anime. This wasn’t a creative decision to implement such censorship, either — rather, it’s the result of a system that forbids truly mature content from airing. Had either anime been released in a modern setting, on a platform like Netflix, I’m certain the content could have thrived and expressed itself without restriction. With roughly 30 original anime series to be produced by the team at Netflix this year alone, it’ll be interesting to see how adventurous creators get with the relaxed restrictions on their content. If DEVILMAN crybaby is the spearhead of a new age of mature creations, then 2018 will definitely be the year that content thrives. Now it’s just up to the experimentation of the creators.|Netflix, DEVILMAN crybaby, Devilman, Yuasa, anime, Violence
12607|2018-01-05|23:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/amazon-strike/| News | Anime | Amazon Kills its 'Anime Strike' Service to Fans' Benefit | Amazon has gotten rid of the much-decried 'Amazon Strike' service. |I would be hard-pressed to think of any more-disliked entity in the North American anime industry in recent days than Amazon's 'Anime Strike' channel. The retail giant's foray into simulcasting anime content probably wouldn't have been met with such a level of disdain if it hadn't essentially sealed everything behind a second $5 paywall -- one that was in addition to the normal cost of an Amazon Prime subscription. Why couldn't the content be treated the same as every other movie or TV show that the service hosted? Was it to supplement licensing costs? Was it some wild assumption that anime fans were willing to shell out a premium for content that, to many, still hasn't quite reached a sort of mainstream appeal? We may never know the answer to that question, but can instead rejoice in the fact that Amazon has decided to do away with the channel altogether. Better still, all that content is still present on the site, and available to watch with a regular Prime membership. A spokesperson provided a comment to Forbes: "We have decided to move the curated catalogs of Anime Strike and Heera into Prime Video so that more customers can enjoy this content as part of their Prime membership." Anime Strike had not been announcing any new licensing acquisitions for the Winter 2018 season, so many suspected that something was amiss behind the scenes. Throughout the past year, I had experienced a small level of dread in knowing that potential anime gems would go widely unseen by people who were unable to pay for an additional streaming source for our favorite hobby. I'm a bit relieved that shows, like Made in Abyss and Anonymous Noise, can now be experienced by a wider array of fans, just like they had deserved to be from the get-go. Will Amazon ever acquire an exclusive anime license again? With other big players like Crunchyroll, Netflix and now HIDIVE all in the game and going strong, it's hard to say.

12606|2018-01-05|20:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/staff-picks-2017/| News | Anime , Manga , Music , Games | OTAQUEST Japanese Pop Culture Staff Picks of 2017 | Calling on the writing staff of OTAQUEST, we delve into the things we all walked away with from the year 2017 in the world of Japanese pop culture. | With 2017 finally at its end, and the year 2018 launching off in all sorts of weird and wonderful directions, we here at OTAQUEST have been reflecting on the year that was, analyzing the trends and happenings in the world of Japanese pop culture that made it so special. There was a whole lot of great that happened in 2017, even if it's sometimes shrouded by everything else going on in the world. When we first put pen to paper with the idea of a year in review piece, we sketched out the idea of each staff writer covering the topics of 'Anime, 'Games,' and 'Music,' but it didn't take too long to realize how secular that would be -- after all, the world of Japanese pop culture doesn't simply revolve around those aforementioned topics. Our end result came out a little less uniform, but all the more accurate, especially given there's not too much 'uniformity' about the world of pop culture. Divided into the answers of each individual writer, we're going to be sharing three things in particular that stood out to us in 2017, that we maybe feel deserve to be known. You can find all of our answers below: Lachlan Johnston (@xrenazuka) 1. Within the world of fashion, 2017 has been a seriously wild ride over here in Japan. It doesn't feel like all that long ago that I first caught wind of a first collaborative fashion line between both my personal favorite graphic designer, GraphersRock, and the long-established branding of PUMA. It again surfaced in the past month that the designer would be collaborating once more, and what a collection it served to be. Combining internet-age design with flashy colors and solid sneakers, GraphersRock blew me away with what he achieved in just 12 short months. 2. It'd be impossible for me to write anything about 2017 without mentioning the Nintendo Switch. Having absolutely struck all the right chords with me, it's easily been one of my year-long favorites. I wrote earlier that it had just become the fastest selling console of all time in North America, and that's with good reason. Between the stellar library of games, the ease of use while out and about or at home -- it truly feels like a console made for my lifestyle. Nintendo hit it out of the ballpark with this one, and I can't wait to see what 2018 brings. 3. For the staff over at humble lil' PARK Harajuku, the year 2017 couldn't have been any bigger. Between the release of their first anime series, URAHARA, and the announcement of their second, CO;RYU, the tucked away melting pot of cultural relevance has been going nowhere but up as of late. Even with all that took place in 2017, the staff has all just been going about their everyday lives, working harder than ever before to continue introducing the streets of Harajuku to new and exciting creators. I've got nothing but respect for PARK, and can't wait to see what comes next. Mike Tamburelli (@Janny_Nash) 1. 2017 was the year that the mainstream gaming public finally started to hold Japanese games on a level of esteem not seen since the decade pre-2010. It was refreshing to see The Game Awards ‘Game of the Year’ category awash with nominees developed by a studio other than Nintendo. I’m not sure what it was specifically about Persona 5 that finally convinced people that JRPGs aren’t bad simply for employing JRPG mechanics, but I’m happy anyway. I’m stoked that a hack‘n slash action RPG featuring an android female-male duo delving into robotic philosophy was able to stand out in an industry full of gun-toting bearded dudes with wise-cracking sidekicks. Some may argue that Japanese game development has finally “caught-up” with techniques in the west, but I remain ever-skeptical of that thought. The industry seems like it’s finally moving on from the rough and gruff FPS phase it’s been in, and realizing once more that some of the strongest bastions of game development creativity have been flourishing in Japan. 2. Chunithm is a Japanese rhythm-arcade game that, while not technically being a product of the year 2017, was certainly enough of a reason to keep me coming back to arcades weekend after weekend this year to spend my hard-earned 100 yen coins. When one thinks of rhythm games, the mind tends to drift towards Konami’s Bemani titles, like Beatmania IIDX, Dance Dance Revolution, and Sound Voltex. Chunithm, on the other hand, was not developed by Konami, but is instead a product of the minds over at SEGA. It seems like game centers never have enough Chunithm machines, as they are always packed and it is not uncommon to have to wait in a line. Other games, however, are usually quite available. The game has kept up some insane momentum by constantly collaborating with popular anime, so you’ll always be able to trace your fingers and wave your hands to some of your favorite tunes. Dare I say that this game has been enough to encourage a huge wave of players to visit their arcades week after week like I have? Is it any coincidence that operators like Round 1 and Taito are seeing improved returns? I think not -- keep your eye on some crazy arcade gaming innovations coming from Japan in the near future. I hear that VR is especially popular recently. 3. In recent times, it has become ever more apparent that animators in Japan’s anime industry have it rough. Standards for animator pay in Japan are quite low, which is a problem when the need to pay the always costly Tokyo rent looms. There are now a few options available to industry outsiders in helping, and even changing the lives of the next generation of creatives -- the least of which is the Non-Profit Organization known as Animator Supporters. Their yearly "Animator Dormitory Projects" aim to raise money for affordable dorm-style housing for animators. Paying no more than 30,000 yen a month including utility costs, animators can skirt Tokyo's rent prices and live in an environment where they can not only survive, but thrive. An additional goal with the dormitory project is to allow an environment where new animators can learn from the more experienced hands as they come to visit. Jun Sugawara has made a splash with his campaign this year, and Animator Supporters raised more money than ever before this year at $25,428 USD -- 170% of the original $10,000 goal. Generous souls have taken notice, and I only hope that this leads to even more meaningful change within the industry we love. Isaac Wong (@lil_yusha) 1. Pokémon illustrator and overall prolific artist Tokiya’s new project has been one of the most exciting things I’ve had the privilege of seeing the beginnings of. Around the middle of 2017, Tokiya reached out to me to do some cursory translations for a new clothing brand he was starting up called None Faith. This collaboration between him and Chloma owner/designer Suzuki Junya is producing some of the coolest illustrations and concepts he has ever created. I can tell you guys without revealing anything that there are more amazing collaborations to come, so keep an eye out! Ζ ∅ I 7 pic.twitter.com/oUI73eYY6i — 7ZEL (@TOKIYA) December 31, 2017 2. To Your Eternity is Ōima Yoshitoki’s new manga coming off of her 2013 hit A Silent Voice, and this comic bangs like no other. It’s an adventure/road trip comic about a deathless being who slowly finds their humanity over the course of meeting and parting with the people and animals he encounters along the way. Its imaginative fantasy setting is naturalistic and believable while still being fresh, and it has a slight SF tinge to it which makes the coming issues unpredictable and exciting. 3. Lastly, the back half of 2017 has been a JP youtube renaissance. Virtual YouTubers such as Kizuna Ai has made such an impression that imitators have been popping up nonstop for the last six months. One of which is Kaguya Luna, a noisy, boisterous virtual YouTuber whose character is a mix of Crayon Shin-chan and Annoying Orange. I love her. Eddie Lehecka (@collectiphile) 1. Those who know me will tell you that I’m a sucker for old anime, and I also love off the wall/slapstick humor. That being the case, it would go without saying that the announcement of Season 2 of Osomatsu-san was one of the biggest moments for me this year. The new season hasn’t let me down at all either, with my personal favorite Matsuno brother, Jyushimatsu, seeing plenty of screen time and a few episodes dedicated to his wacky nature. It’s also been great to see all of the additional love the supporting characters have gotten this season so far. I can’t wait to see where they go with the 2nd half of the season in 2018! 2. For someone who doesn’t have a lot of time to sit down and play console games, having a full-fledged console Mario game at my fingertips was easily one of the pure joys of my 2017 travel experience. Not only is Super Mario Odyssey an incredibly well designed game, but the amount of crazy stuff you can do thanks to the new movement options & physics paired with what can only be described as a love letter to Mario’s history make this very close to the top of my personal ranking for every game in the franchise. The soundtrack for the game is one of my favorites for the year as well, with "Jump Up! Super Star" still frequently stuck in my head leaving my toe tapping. It might still be a while before I hit 100% in the game due to my schedule, but the game is so fun to play that I’m going to savor every minute of the journey. 3. There have been a lot of really great anime fashion collaborations to come out this year, but New York-based Supreme knocked it out of the park with this line. While the brand has a tendency to be pretty hard to access, I made sure to pick up several pieces from this collection for myself as a massive fan of both Akira and Supreme. Aside from Akira's notoriety worldwide being a huge selling point, what really got me on this was the use of original art from the manga rather than the anime for these pieces. The striking image of the explosion in Neo Tokyo used on several of the pieces has to be my favorite of the scenes they chose, and the subtle Supreme branding on the other shirts is a perfect way to make sure the collaboration doesn’t come off as too heavy-handed or detract from Otomo’s original art. My only complaint is that I wasn’t able to buy everything in this collection. What do you think, was there anything in particular that you fell in love with throughout 2017? Looking back on it all, while the year was filled with high-points and very much stands on its own merit, I can't help but feel that the year was simply laying down the foundations for what's to come. If that does happen to be true, of course, then we'll only be going up from here.|OTAQUEST, Staff Picks, Pop Culture, Tokiya, To Your Eternity, Isaac Wong, Lachlan Johnston, Eddie Lehecka, Mike Tamburelli, Oima Toshitoki, Kaguya Luna, Supreme, Akira, Super Mario Odyssey, Osomatsu-san
12605|2018-01-05|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-switch-domination/| News | Games | Nintendo Switch Becomes Fastest Selling Console Ever in US | Selling more than 4.8 million units in the console’s first 10 months, the Nintendo Switch has gone on to become the fastest selling console in US history. |It’s no surprise that the Nintendo Switch has been an incredibly well performing console — just getting your hands on one is still proving a difficult task. With a steady and powerful lineup of titles to bring the console to life, Nintendo seemingly cracked the formula required to bring their company back to the forefront of the gaming world. That’s why recent news of the Nintendo Switch becoming the fasting selling console in the history of the United States comes as such little surprise, but something very much worth celebrating. Being home to two of the highest regarded video games of all time — The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, — the Nintendo Switch has been one of the hottest items available over the last 10 months since it’s initial release. With a total of 4.8 million sales, surpassing the previous record held by the Nintendo Wii at 4 million sales, there has been absolutely no signs of slowing down for the hybrid console. Following the sales announcement, Nintendo of America went on to announce that amongst owners of the console, 60% own the latest Super Mario Odyssey, and 55% own The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Following those two titles, it’s been revealed that 50% have a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and 20% own a copy of Splatoon 2. The company also went on to mention their 300 available titles, and massive support from the indie gaming community — not bad for a consoles first 10 months. There’s something just so charming about the Nintendo Switch that I simply haven’t been able to put to words. Between it’s incredibly functional portability aspect, coupled with the ease of use at home, I’ve never felt so unrestricted by a console. I’ve been totally captivated within the worlds of both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Spelunker Party (both titles I picked up recently), and before that found endless amounts of enjoyment in both Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Odyssey. With the success found by the console, I can only hope it continues to receive incredible first and third party support, and that Nintendo runs just as strong in the year 2018.|Nintendo, Switch, Zelda, Mario, Breath of the Wild, Sales, North America, USA, Nintendo of America, Super Mario Odyssey

12601|2018-01-04|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/round-one-usa/| News | Games | Japanese Arcade Company Round1 has Some Ambitious US Plans | One of the biggest Japanese arcade companies is planning some ambitious USA expansion, ushering in the return of the golden years of arcade gaming. |It’s definitely something you’ll come to relize pretty quickly around here, but the OTAQUEST staff as a whole absolutely adore the climate offered by Japanese arcades. Existing in a pre-ticketed reward state, and offering an expansive and exciting gaming experience, there’s nothing like it. Between the range of competitive fighting games, rhythm games, and even mahjong games, we’re engrossed in the world once offered by American arcades in the pre-2000s. With all that being said, there’s been some extremely exciting prospects for the American arcade scene. If all goes well, it might be time to say goodbye to ticketing temptations from larger-than-smartphone adaptations of Fruit Ninja and Flappy Bird, and hello to some of Japan’s heaviest-hitters including the likes of Groove Coaster, Sound Voltex, and BlazBlue — at least to some degree. I’m sure somewhere out there, there exists a following for ticketed machines, and we’re sure they’ll still get a bit of their fill too. According to major Japanese newspaper, The Asahi Shimbun, Round1, one of Japan's largest and most prominent arcade operators, is looking to acquire large and abandoned US buildings to give them an extra life as game centers. The Osaka-based company operates a large number of combination bowling alley, arcade, karaoke, and food service facilities in both Japan and the US. Since demand has been decreasing a bit in Japan due to an aging population and rising land costs, the company has been hoping that international expansion would be enough to keep the business running strong. The bet has largely paid off, as the formerly abandoned spaces have served as great locations for forms of entertainment largely forgotten in the US market until now. The company hopes to add at least 10 locations every year in the US through the end of 2025 in order to match the number of locations in Japan. If the company can pull this off successfully, it would mark an absolutely huge comeback in the American public video gaming and arcade sphere. Let's hope that the power of rhythm games and the insanely fun appeal of Japanese-style karaoke is enough to keep the momentum going.

12592|2017-12-28|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/tom-otakucoin/| News | Anime | 'Otaku Coin' Cryptocurrency from Tokyo Otaku Mode Researched | Tokyo Otaku Mode is considering releasing a brand-new cryptocurrency dubbed 'Otaku Coin,' and is trying to do so with a lot of outside help. |What if there was a way to pay for anything and everything related to your otaku tendencies, be that anime, manga, games, conventions, and figures, while never having to spend your hard-earned dollars? Well, there isn't, and there likely won't ever be one, but this newest initiative from the minds of Tokyo Otaku Mode allow us to at least say that we can under a technicality. Cryptocurrency: a word that has been all-too-familiar recently, as the world's most famous example of digital money Bitcoin has been appearing in myriad headlines due to some pretty wild fluctuations in valuation. Stories have come out in which people have bought Bitcoin at a perceived low-point in a rapidly-rising value surge, only to lose their life's savings when the rates took a sudden tumble. It's easy to see why any normal person would be quite nervous at the prospect of buying-in to any sort of alternative cloud-based money, and it would appear that Tokyo Otaku Mode seems to understand that. That's why they have been very careful to stop short of fully-announcing that 'Otaku Coin' is a real thing that they are definitely releasing, and have simply stated that the system is under "consideration." In practice, Otaku Coin would let you pay for new anime, as in, actually helping to fund it by giving it directly to the creators. It would also let you pay for merchandise, and buy you entry into events. You'll be able to purchase Otaku Coin with your own country's currency, and you would also be able to earn it through games and promotions. Take a look at the simple video explanation below: The company has made a point in noting that many aspects of the coin's design could be handled by famous industry figures, such as illustration on the coin's face and even sound effects to be used when users earn and spend the coins. Perhaps of most interest to myself is Tokyo Otaku Mode' s proposal of the 'Anime Production Committee 2.0,' which would take the place of the committee system most-commonly used in anime production these days. Under the old system, stakeholders such as anime studio, corporate sponsors, and merchandise manufacturers all get a say in how an anime is produced, with very little direct fan input. Tokyo Otaku Mode sees their new system spearheaded by Otaku Coin as a way to blend the recent trend of crowdfunding in anime with the production committee system, giving fans more of a direct way to influence their favorite creations. I have to admit, I am fascinated. If you would like to be a part of Otaku Coin's special research and feedback groups, then I would recommend keeping an eye on all of these resources: Otaku Coin ICO Consideration Website: https://otaku-coin.com Telegram: (English) https://telegram.me/otakucoin (Japanese) https://telegram.me/otakucoinjp Facebook Group (Available Worldwide): https://www.facebook.com/groups/otakucoin/ Finally, every last little detail can be found in the English press release, here. What do you think? How keen are you into buying-in to the cryptocurrency future, all while continuing to support our favorite hobbies? In addition to telling us, I would advise you to give Tokyo Otaku Mode all of your feedback to assist in a well-advised plan!

After a recent signing to Toy's Factory Japan which thrust the now 24-year old musician into the world of major labels, we've seen a slew of recent works including her debut major EP MELANCOZMO. Almost 5 months after the EP's initial release, we're finally seeing the latest fruits of her labor, attacking our feeds in the form of "SUIPARA" and it's accompanying music video. Utilizing the high-tension formula that TORIENA has so tightly been associated with, we're launched into the bass-infused chiptune riot that is "SUIPARA." Having seen the artist tease the single at live shows a number of times, it's such a relief to finally get my hands on it. Perhaps enjoyed best accompanying the likeness of a classic Super Famicom game's boss level, the no-bars-held track might just constitute one of TORIENA's best releases to date, and also gives listeners a steady idea of the direction she's heading musically. If you're interested in checking out more from the rapidly rising artist, I definitely recommend taking a look at her extensive backlog of sounds via both SoundCloud and YouTube.

But if you're looking for official merch then the convenience store just might have you covered. |Comiket has long served as a destination for the most hardcore of otaku across a wide range of interests, be that anime, video games, music, and even connoisseurs of cute cat photography. If you are looking to support your favorite fan creators and perhaps even get the chance to hand them your cold hard cash in person while engaging in some light pleasantries, then Comiket is an event that you won't want to miss for sure -- despite the oftentimes miserable weather conditions you'll have to endure before being let inside the venue. If your goal, however, is to grab some officially-licensed merchandise, then you may not even have to step foot inside the Tokyo Big Sight at all -- that is if these official goods being offered by Japanese convenience store chain Lawson spark any interest for you. A shop all-too-familiar to the legions of Comiket-goers over the years: the Lawson located outside of Kokusai-tenjijo station, the stop nearest Big Sight. You may have stopped in for rations and supplies before your doujin expeditions in the past, but now you can also pick up a variety of great-looking goods from some of the hottest properties of late, including Fate/Grand Order and Girls und Panzer. Lawson is certainly no stranger to anime collaborations, with series such as K-On!, Madoka Magica, and Attack on Titan all having gotten official tie-ins in the past. Beyond dressing-up anime characters in the signature Lawson uniform, it seems that the chain wants to step-up their involvement in the anime goods world even further. All of the items are available at the Lawson Kokusai-tenjijo Ekimae starting today and will be sold as long as supplies last until December 31. Goods can also be purchased via the store's Loppi terminals or on the HMV website, but that comes with a wait until April of next year. If you want these goods now, you best head to Comiket! Or, you know, get as close to it as you can without actually going inside. You can find all of the goods in the promotional image below. Get ready to scroll through though, it's a doozy.

Filled with gently sprinkled chords and glistening harmonics, "interdimensional portal leading to a cute place" was everything we could possibly hope for from the two artists. In similar style, this week we finally got to experience the beauty that is "Journey," an audio-visual experience made possible through the efforts of the two artists and animator kiiroi tomato club. Released as a Christmas gift to all, "Journey" exists to whisk listeners away to a different place -- to take them on a journey. It's a proven recipe from the duo, with each track coming out all the sweeter. It's also the first collaboration between the duo to receive an accompanying music video, something which only adds to the total immersion of their sound. If you've ever enjoyed a Snail's House song's illustration, chances are it was done by illustrator/animator Noelle, the genius behind the "Journey" music video. Offering viewers a throwback filled music video offering an extensive look at the musical history of both artists, it's a charming animated adventure akin to the dreamscapes found within a Ghibli film. If you haven't had a chance to check out either the song or the music video, I can't help but urge you to do so. Find a quiet place surrounded by what you love and let yourself be taken away; it really is an experience. Available for streaming on all major services, you can check out the song, here.

The ATLUS produced Persona series has been a long-standing part of my gaming history -- as it has for many -- but thinking back on it, there's perhaps no entry that stood out more to me than the 2015-released Persona 4: Dancing All Night. That's why when ATLUS announced two more entries into the rhythm game-infused spinoff series, I couldn't help but be excited. Set to release on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on May 24, 2018, both Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night have finally had their tracklisting revealed, and it's an absolute adventure. We'll take a look at Persona 3 tracks first, then we'll jump over to the more recent Persona 5 tracklisting. Persona 3: Dancing Moon Light Tracklist: Brand New Days (Yuyoyuppe Remix) Mass Destruction When The Moon’s Reaching Out Stars (Hideki Naganuma Remix) Want to be Close (ATOLS Remix) Shinsou Shinri (Lotus Juice Remix) Deep Breath Deep Breath (Yuu Miyake Remix) Soul Phrase Light the Fire Up in the Night “KAGEJIKAN” + “MAYONAKA” Burn My Dread (Novoiski Remix) When the Moon’s Reaching Out Stars Time (Atlus Kitajoh Remix) Wiping All Out (Atlus Kozuka Remix) A Way of Life (Atlus Kitajoh Remix) Heartful Cry (Atlus Konishi Remix) Light the Fire Up in the Night “KAGEJIKAN” + “MAYONAKA” (sasakure.UK Remix) Mass Destruction (Tetsuya Kobayashi Remix) Subete no Hito no Tamashii no Tatakai (T.Komine Remix) Burn My Dread Subete no Hito no Tamashii no Tatakai (Daisuke Asakura Remix) Kimi no Kioku (Atlus Meguro Remix) Our Moment Moonlight Serendipity Mass Destruction (Persona Music FES 2013) Burn My Dread -Last Battle- Brand New Days When I said I was excited about these upcoming games, I don't think I accurately expressed just how ecstatic I am to jam out to some of these remixes. It's no joke when I say there was a thud to the sound of my jaw hitting the ground to the tune of Hideki Naganuma's "When The Moon's Reaching Out Stars" remix, or even the likes of Yuyoyuppe remixing "Brand New Days." There's a lot of different artists here, each crafting a very different soundscape, something I can't wait to hear for myself. Persona 5: Dancing Star Night Tracklist Rivers in the Desert Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There (Jazztronik Remix) Keeper of Lust Blooming Villain (Atlus Konishi Remix) Hoshi to Bokura to (Tofubeats Remix) Tokyo Daylight (Atlus Kozuka Remix) Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There Rivers in the Desert (Mito Remix) Blooming of Villain Life Goes On Price Whims of Fate (Yukihiro Fuktomi Remix) Beneath the Mask (KAIEN Remix) Will Power (Shacho Remix) Last Surprise (Taku Takahashi Remix) Haha no Ita Hibi (Atlus Kitajoh Remix) Life Will Change (Atlus Meguro Remix) Jaldabaoth~Our Beginning Last Surprise Life Will Change GROOVY One Nightbreak Rivers in the Desert (Persona Super Live P-Sound Bomb 2017) Hoshi to Bokura to Last Surprise (Jazztronik Remix) Sorry, Persona 3, I'll always love you; though Persona 5 absolutely has you beat on this one in my books. Calling on some of my all-time favorite musicians including both Tofubeats and Taku Takahashi, there's so much that ATLUS have done right on this one. The lineup is absolutely stacked, and it offers such an incredible opportunity to enjoy what is an already incredible soundtrack once more, from a different perspective. If the story is as good as what I'm imagining the music will be, this will absolutely be one incredible release. Speaking of that Taku Takahashi remix of "Last Surprise," we reached out for a word from the musician regarding his thoughts on the creation of the remix. Those words can be found below: I was originally asked to create a remix of the song, which I realised it had some pretty incredible vocals and strings. That being said, I couldn't help but want to change the feeling of it a little. I put some classic UK Garage -- or maybe it'd be JP Garage now -- twists on it, all while mashing in my signature chopped sampling, something that's been a staple of mine since the early m-flo days. All in all, I couldn't be any more excited about the upcoming entries into the Persona series of games. With a wildly-enjoyable rhythm game as its outer layer, and the always-thoughtful Persona game at its core, there's a lot of reasons why you should also start getting excited. If you're interested in checking out a little more about the game, swing on over to the official website for a few more details.

12549|2017-12-20|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/namakopuri-z-reveal/| News | Music | Namakopuri Powers Up & Covers 'Mazinger Z' Theme Song | Gone are the days of the two-person art idol unit 'Namakopuri,' and ushered in is the new age of the four-person-one-cat super team, 'Namakopuri Z.' |You may remember in the past we introduced attendees at Anime Expo 2017 to Namakopuri, a two-person idol unit with a specific focus on artsy music. They were as quirky as they came, and offered a nice abstract to the usual composition of an idol group here in Japan. Well, it's unfortunate to say that the group is no more -- instead, making way for the vastly more powerful Namakopuri Z. Check out the teaser below before we get into any more details: For those who may not have seen any number of their postings, Namakopuri Z is the next generation of the idol unit, inviting three new members (one of which is a cat) into the team making for a larger group than ever before. Utilizing the power of five, we're graced with the group's first song, a cover of anime theme classic "Mazinger Z," re-arranged by Taku Takahashi of m-flo. Before we get into that, however, let's go back to the video and pay particular attention to the opening; that gentleman was Michiake Watanabe, the composer behind the original Mazinger Z series, and grandfather of original Namakopuri member Makopuri. With a new Mazinger Z film just around the corner in 2018, "Mazinger Z Infinite," the time was absolutely right for the group to push out the cover. Combining the group's new overwhelming power, Taku Takahashi's insane production value, and the long-lasting nostalgia of the original song, Namakopuri Z's cover proves a hit from start to finish. Making the cherry on top, of course, is the wonderful artwork done by one of my personal favorite artists Ai Madonna. The original Namakopuri duo was launched into international attention following the release of tracks such as "Sushi Party prod. Masayoshi Iimori," making their way to major festivals such as ULTRA Miami in the United States after being dropped by the likes of Mija and Ookay. Both the former and current groups best fall under the descriptions of 'art idols,' especially with each and every member's rich history in the artistic fields. We're excited to see where the members go from here on out, and can't wait to see what comes next for Namakopuri Z.

It represents the next lunge forward in the ever-evolving music game genre, bringing with it a divisive new tracklist that includes two incredible songs that were previewed via Konami's official YouTube channel this week. I'm talking of course, about the entries by both Taku Takahashi and YUC'e into the beatmania universe. Let's take a look at the entry from YUC'e first of all, coming in with the incredible "Chemical Cookie." From start to finish, the song feels and breathes the very essence of beatmania, all while sprinkling in the charm that makes each of YUC'e releases so addictively sweet. I'm not kidding when I say both myself and other staff members here have had the phrase "EAT IT!! EAT IT!! and DO IT!! DO IT!!" stuck in our head all day, with absolutely no sign of that clearing up anytime soon. Following YUC'e entry into the game, we have Taku Takahashi's "Last Century Melancholic," a highly-experimental 'Future J-pop' track filled to the brim with gorgeous arps and beautiful chords. That beauty doesn't last, however, as players enter the destructive breakdown that had us moving in ways we didn't know possible. It's something unlike anything else I've ever heard and is definitely a welcome addition to the games constantly evolving catalog. If there's ever been a time to get into the arcade series, this would absolutely have to be it. Set to release in Japan on December 21, 2017, players can expect to find cabinets at their local arcades updated in time for opening that day. There has been no word of a release date in the United States. Interested in making your way to Japan to check out the game?

12539|2017-12-19|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/catherine-full-body/| News | Games | 'Catherine: Full Body' Coming to PlayStation 4 and Vita | Puzzle adventure game 'Catherine' is getting a current-gen release in the way of 'Catherine: Full Body,' exclusively on PlayStation 4 and Vita. |In February 2011, the world was blessed with a game, unlike anything else we had ever enjoyed. It played to the tune of a relatively simple concept -- you're a 30-something-year-old male who is juggling the love interest of several vastly different women who all go by variants of the name Catherine. It would be when nighttime struck, however, that the real game would come to full fruition. Catherine, the brainchild game of Atlus' own Katsura Hashino was a title unlike any other. That's why it's so exciting that, over 6 years after its initial release, it will be receiving a remake on both PlayStation 4 and Vita in the form of "Catherine: Full Body." Revealed this week, the puzzle adventure game will be making the grand jump to the next generation -- fitting for a game that ushered in the next generation for Atlus when it launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Atlus made the reveal in way of an official website for the game, as well as an announcement to look forward to an upcoming live stream for the game which will be taking place on December 22, 2017, at 7:30 pm JST. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu earlier revealed that the January 2018 issue of the magazine would include further information on the game, and is set to release in Japan on December 21, 2017. The game will continue to revolve around Vincent, while also throwing in a new romantic interest into the game by the name of Rin. It will feature new and enhanced visuals and levels, as well as an all-new online multiplayer battle mode on both the PlayStation 4 and Vita releases. Currently being developed by Atlus' recently announced internal development team Studio Zero, director Katsura Hashino has stated that the game is sitting at the 50% completion mark. We'll be sure to keep you up to date as further information is revealed over the coming days here in Japan. Images: Atlus|Catherine, Full Body, Playstation, Vita, PlayStation 4, sony, Atlus

12525|2017-12-18|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/moe-shop-charm-w-puniden/| News | Music | Moe Shop Drops New Single 'Charm' with Puniden, Announces EP | After almost a year of waiting, the latest original from Moe Shop 'Charm' is finally here, and its coupling with Puniden's incredible lyrics make for one wild ride. |When it comes to musicians whose work I've consistently held in the highest regard, France-based producer Moe Shop seemingly strikes a chord every time. His hyper-groovy jams have been on repeat since I first stumbled across "You Look So Good" on Bandcamp, and the producer has been going nowhere but up since then. With a collaboration with Ujico*/Snail's House and an official remix for Fusq (w/ MYLK) under his belt, Moe Shop today dropped the addictively sweet "Charm" alongside Japan-based vocalist and producer Puniden. Tugging on the heart-strings of listeners, "Charm" offers a glimpse into the current direction that Moe Shop is striding towards. With a clear-cut Bossa nova influence towards the latter half of the song, we find ourselves whisked away by the lyrical stylings of Puniden on an adventure into the night. If there was ever a perfect match when it comes to the realm of music, it would have to be both Moe Shop and Puniden. We sat down with Moe Shop over a coffee and strawberry milk to discuss his latest single, as well a special announcement he has in regards to future plans. We also reached out to Puniden for her insight into the lyrics; both of which can be found below: Moe Shop: Overall, the process of creating this song was a whole lot of fun. I made the instrumental back in France over the course of three-days with a whole bunch of inspiration, going for somewhat of a Persona 5 vibe. I'd been following Puniden online for quite some time, and I wanted to see if she'd be down to work with me. I reached out on Twitter, and she got back to me almost immediately saying she'd love to. The whole process was a lot of fun, it didn't feel like 'business' at all, but more like two good friends working together. Things went smoothly, and we were constantly shooting our work back and forward between the two of us. For the artwork, I reached out to a Japanese artist I've been following for some time, and have so much praise for, Kogecha. It was interesting breaking through the language barrier, but we managed to make it work. Looking forward into the future, the direction I'm taking now is a much more personal approach, branching further into the Japanese music scene in an effort to present some of the incredible talent there to the world. I'm stepping away from sampling, and getting more into actual synthesizers and jamming out on them. Everything feels more personal this way, and that's something I've been working towards since 'Pastel' with Ujico. For the past seven months, I've been working in secret on a new EP in both France and Japan, constantly flying between the two countries. I've had the opportunity to work alongside a number of Japanese artists I look up to, and I'm definitely excited for that EP to drop early 2018. I don't want to reveal too much right now, but three of the artists that are locked down include Toriena, Puniden, and MYLK. You'll see a few other names join them on the release, but we're still working out logistics there. It'll be super exciting to finally get this out to all of you, and I hope everyone enjoys it. Puniden: When working on the track, I listened to Moe Shop's instrumental time and time again. It was from those listening sessions that I found myself inspired to create the overall theme of the lyrics. There's an image of a girl who is equal parts cute and promiscuous gracefully strolling the streets during the night. Within the lyrics, I wanted to make sure the idea of her being both cute and promiscuous was properly presented. I couldn't have been more grateful to work with Moe Shop, and 100% enjoyed the entire process. I hope you enjoy our new song "Charm"! With a focus on the talents of Japan, we couldn't be more excited to see what Moe Shop pulls off in his latest EP.

12521|2017-12-16|03:50|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/m-flo-reunion-interview/| News | Music | m-flo Reunion Interview: Tripod Is Back | m-flo surprised fans worldwide yesterday with the announcement that LISA would be returning to the group to create new music in time for their 20th anniversary. We sat down to chat about this all. |It was only yesterday that m-flo surprised fans all over the world with the announcement that original member LISA would be returning to the group to create new music in time for their 20th anniversary. For those of you who are unfamiliar with why this is such a big deal, LISA’s contributions to the group’s first 2 albums (Planet Shining & Expo Expo) were a significant part of their appeal abroad, and some of those original tracks remain fan favorites even to this day. Her departure from the group to pursue a solo career led to Verbal & Taku Takahashi to press forward and create the massively successful ‘m-flo loves’ series, which brought a whole new level of international notoriety with it. While LISA did contribute to a few tracks during this era in the group’s history, fans have never stopped hoping for the trio to get back together and usher in yet another chapter era in m-flo’s story. Thanks to our friends at block.fm, we have been given the opportunity to share the first interview with the newly re-formed m-flo with you, along with some additional comments specifically for their international fans. Both longtime fans and newcomers just joining the ride, we hope you enjoy this deep dive into what is already one of our most anticipated reunions for 2018: Interview with Taku Takahashi: Q: Almost 20 years after the debut of m-flo, why was it that the three of you have now decided to reunite? It definitely wasn’t something that just happened suddenly — it’s actually been in the talks for quite a while now. It was a little bit ago now, but I was offered a gig to DJ for LISA at a Christmas event last year for J-Wave, a radio station in Tokyo. This would actually be the first time you and I met properly, if I remember correctly. We performed a few m-flo tracks, and couldn’t be more happy with how emotionally the crowd responded. They welcomed us very warmly, both myself and LISA were truly touched. That night both LISA and I agreed that we’d work towards doing something like this again, given the chance. This was the moment the idea of LISA returning to m-flo really started to spark; though, to be honest, VERBAL and I had already discussed it many times. It was after this performance, however, that I knew it had to happen. It was when I went to talk to VERBAL about this that something terrible happened, following a large-scale car accident on Christmas Eve. It took some time, but I was beyond relieved when I heard he was going to be okay. We actually had a booking for Universal Studio Japan’s Countdown Party, which was something we had to decide if VERBAL could make it or not for. Unfortunately he couldn’t make it, but I thought it was clear that the show should still go on, and decided it would be the perfect time to propose bringing LISA in for support. It was awesome to hear them say yes right away, and the Countdown Party event ended up going incredibly too. I want to give a shout out to the USJ staff for supporting us too. We had a really good talk when I went to see VERBAL in hospital about LISA returning for more than just that show, and he was totally down for it. So that’s how we got to where we are now. Q: What was it like having the three of you back in the studio after all this time? Was there any difference now compared to the earlier days? Back then, VERBAL would write all his lyrics back at home, but these days he likes to vibe out with us all at the studio while writing. I was also surprised how much faster LISA was when it came to recording now too. All that said, however, I don’t think much has changed amongst us fundamentally. The most important thing to all of us is how we express our emotions, and how we make them sound interesting. That’s what our journey is all about. It’s also super easy given how well we all know each other, we can sit down and just vibe without needing to explain ourselves. Q: What about yourself? What’s been giving you inspiration to create as of late? I’ve got a weekly radio show on block.fm which acts as a catalyst for listening to new and emerging electronic music from all around the world. It’s a great experience to be able to do such, but I feel as though it stagnated my ability to clearly view what I want should be making. My idea of m-flo has always been a platform to introduce something different, create a new trend in the world of J-pop. Since EDM-style is starting to become more mainstream in Japan, I’ve had to ponder what the next big thing I want to introduce should be. Listening to new tracks from around the world is definitely stimulating, but that’s not enough — there needs to be research and studying involved too, something I got tired of very quickly. I remembered a quote from from Osamu Tezuka around this point, “If you want to become a great comic writer, you need to consume great music and movies. Try to get inspiration from a medium outside of what you usually work with.” I took that to heart, and dwelled deep into US dramas and cartoons such as “Game of Thrones” and “Rick and Morty,” just to name a few. They helped me become more so aware of the global scene, and inspired me to stimulate myself with more content from outside of Japan. I’m somewhat defiant towards listening to old m-flo work. I always manage to find some small mistake that I wish I could fix, and it’s the inability to do so that makes me regretful. Maybe I’m just a perfectionist in that regard. It was because of this I avoided listening to our older works; I didn’t even have any of it in my playlists, except for some I would use in DJ sets. Recently I actually had the chance to listen to some of our older works, however, after a friend of mine forcibly played it in front of me. I started to realize that it wasn’t as bad as I imagined, and even began to ponder how I pulled off some of my old sound tricks. It made me look back and realize something simple — although my old works weren’t perfect, it was all different and unique in a way that was good for both Japan and the international music scene. It was honestly quite stimulating. I couldn’t believe I had been so inspired by work from 20 years ago, let alone something by myself. This was something I’d never expected, a breakthrough in where I pulled inspiration from. Funny how that works. Q: You’ve been playing a lot of DJ gigs outside of Japan this year, with a particular increase in shows in the United States. Did you manage to pull any inspiration from those trips? I had the unique opportunity to perform at nine different conventions this year, and it was totally awesome. The best part about convention raves is that I can just be myself; I can play all the underground music, while also spinning in a little m-flo at the same time. The audiences are so energetic, it’s always exciting to witness. In a way, I’d even suggest they’re a little more open to a wider variety of styles than even the Japanese underground scene. Q: There are a number of m-flo fans in the United States that are looking forward to the upcoming production. Did you ever get to interact with any of them, and would you say you learned anything if you did? Whenever I attend a convention, I try my hardest to avoid just being the DJ for the night. I want to interact personally with as many people as possible, whenever I get the chance. People will tell me all about how they feel in regards to what I’m doing, as well as to m-flo and I always walk away with new inspiration. One of the more interesting comments I received at one point was a question regarding why we chose to start making EDM-style music, and why we would simply adopt what was already big in the US. They finished that up with a message that they appreciated what we did before, though. It was pretty harsh, but also very interesting (laughs). As for my perspective on the comment, it’s just as I mentioned above — m-flo is all about introducing something different to the J-pop music scene. What was big in the West was not big in Japan, so it fit the motif at the time. That being said, it did make me realize the tremendous difference between the ‘classic m-flo’ and m-flo post the “Loves” series. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two time periods, however, is that I’ve gotten technically more advanced in music production. I also now have access to a better music creation team. The technology in the field has also leaped forward, meaning it’s much easier to create much higher quality electronic music than ever before. Since I first started making music, it’s always been a matter of me finding something I like, trying to put my own spin on that style, then implementing it into m-flo. That’s the very same mindset I’ve had from the beginning. The thing was back then, we all had different synthesizers. Let’s say I liked the bass line utilized by Daft Punk, and let’s say they were using a Roland synthesizer. If I own a Moog synthesizer, no matter how hard I try to recreate the Daft Punk bass line sound, I simply wouldn’t be able to. But that was the beauty of it, in trying to replicate that sound using something different, you’d in turn create something different that might sound great. That made each sound unique, and that was also what made the old m-flo sound so unique. In other words, my flawed desire to create something perfect is what gave m-flo it’s unique edge. Since there’s been so many advancements in the field of computer-based production as of late, it’s very easy to make some really great things which I think is cool. Everyone has access to the same software synthesizers and that’s combined with all the great sounding presets. I can’t control that urge to create something inspired by other artists, but that’s a bit of a problem given everyone is using the same tools these days. I figured at this point I should give some of my old production techniques a shot. That was part of the reason I started breaking some of my vintage synthesizers out of the attic — using them in pair with my old style has always proven to create some pretty good accidents different from others. Q: Is there anything you’re excited to try with the new m-flo? I really want to focus on creating great music with m-flo. We’re having to be aware at the same time of how we release our music in this age of the internet. We’ll of course be releasing on both CD and digital services, but VERBAL and I are trying to come up with something different that’s not been done before. I kept on mentioning the importance of introducing something different in the J-Pop scene, but I also am heavily invested in introducing the up-and-coming artists of Japan’s underground scene also. These days it’s uncommon for a lot of Japanese artists to do remixes, but we’d like to try and get some really great remixes done. I’d actually love to have a bunch of bootleg remixes done and sent through to me. Maybe we could even work on making it an official remix if it’s something great. I want the J-pop scene to be more creative, rather than just focusing on commercialism. We might be able to start releasing new remixes in the near future. Q: Finally, can you tell us three of the things you like about m-flo? The cool thing about m-flo is that, firstly, we all have different areas of expertise which helps make something completely unique and different from anything else. Secondly, we can be experimental while still releasing in the major market, there’s not many artists that can do that. Thirdly, and possibly most importantly, we have fans that are there for us because our music is different. I sincerely appreciate that. I would like us to create something genuinely unique for thing J-pop and Western culture. Interview with VERBAL: Q: To get the ball rolling, let’s talk about when was the decision to re-form m-flo as a trio made. What was the catalyst for all of that? At the end of last year, during the annual “Universal Countdown Party” held at Universal Studios Japan, I was set to be performing alongside Taku as m-flo, but right before that could happen, I was hospitalized after a car accident in Hokkaido. That was when LISA swooped in and saved the day by filling my spot. Her performance was wild, and it became a pretty trending topic with everyone requesting we start performing as a trio again. Q: So in 2017, that idea became more solidified amongst you all? During 2016 we played around with the idea quite a bit, but nothing was ever really set in stone. After the Universal Studios Japan show, however, we really began to think that the time was right to reunite as a trio. Q: Did it feel like there had been a drastically long period since you last worked with LISA? Between both myself and Taku, the topic of creating music together with LISA was almost a part of daily conversation. We were actually thrilled that she made an appearance as a guest singer in “BEAT SPACE NINE.” As time flowed on though, we all became involved even further with our respective solo careers, and it was only now that the timing became ideal -- but really, I was always enamored by the idea. As I suspected, when LISA entered the studio with us once again, she brought that special something that only she possesses, and it felt right at home for m-flo. Q: Compared to m-flo’s first recording, was the approach for this latest one any different? Yeah, it’s changed pretty clearly in many ways. When we debuted in 1998, none of us were all too familiar with how to conduct ourselves as musicians. There was this strong feeling of recklessness in wanting to create songs that sounded cool to us over all else. We didn’t understand the formula for creating something great, and we didn’t pay attention to things like being ahead or behind on trends. We simply went along with how we felt about music. Looking back on it know, working with all the artists we did during our “m-flo Loves” series definitely helped us experience a whole world of things outside of the realm of simply making music. But when I entered the studio with LISA and Taku recently, I again was hit with that feeling of ease I could find only with them. It wasn’t even just because it was easier, but more so because it felt all the more right. Being in an environment where I don’t have to hide my passion, that’s definitely the best thing. When describing LISA, the term bandmate definitely comes to mind. Of course, I have enormous respect for her, but when we’re working together as a trio, it’s so much easier to just speak my mind (Laughs). Something that I’ve gotten used to recently is thinking of lyrics after I’ve arrived at the studio. In all my previous works, it was always a matter of coming up with them before hitting the recording studio. I think it’s easier to create lyrics while in the studio now, especially coupled with the sound of the music through the speakers available in there. I’m also able to speak with those involved while I’m there too, that’s something that helps a lot. The major difference between the m-flo of the past and the m-flo of now is how we’ve all essentially matured into adults. In the past there was a pretty big desire to represent myself first and foremost (laughs). I just wasn’t capable of seeing the whole picture back then. Even now, Taku’s been producing soundtracks for movies and TV shows, all while building up block.fm at the same time -- we’ve all piled on these unique experiences. Now, I feel like we can analyze a situation properly to figure out which route will work the best. When I first started, there was also a massive desire to cram everything I wanted to do into just one song. These days, however, I’ve got more of a bird’s-eye view on what I want to accomplish, allowing me to spread all of that out over multiple songs. Q: Was that feeling of things feeling “right” when the three of you are in the studio together reflected in your songs? LISA once said to me “Haven’t your raps been kind of same-same lately? It was way better when you used to say a number of crazy, out of this world stuff in the past.” I spent a bit of time trying to figure out what she meant by that, and actually began looking at some of my old lyrical notes. I realized the me of back then was kind of weird, but in a good way. I started to agree with what she was telling me, and began going back to my previous style of writing lines. LISA’s melodies tend to boil and pop at the surface like hot water. The songs she’s sung for us recently all have that kind of feeling. One thing that hasn’t changed in regards to the way Taku does things though is that all his demos tend to be pretty rough. When we made “come again,” he actually gave me a drum-only track. Without even knowing any sort of theme, I was tasked with writing the lyrics and LISA would write the melody. Following that, Taku would wrap up the arrangement, that’s our process. Now it’s not quite as bad as before, but we still record on a rough track. Taku will then start adding the strings and so on. LISA would always mention that she would rather sing on a more complete version of the song (Laughs). Taku’s always fast with his production though, and he has a lot of ideas. He’s really leveled-up his skills, the both of them have. Q: Do you all get hyped-up when talking about music? LISA is always saying that listening to Western music while she’s outside of Japan allows her to vibe more than when she’s listening to it in Japan. When it comes to Taku and I, however, we tend to throw a bunch of YouTube videos between each other and discuss technology that we think is cool. Q: What kind of direction are you looking to head in your newest work? For example, are you shooting for a more worldwide direction? Rather than aiming to be worldwide, we really just want to create music that will really stick with the people. Q: How do you feel being a member of m-flo today? For us, being part of m-flo is like being at home. It’s not a job, really. It’s not about making a lot of money or becoming really famous either. It’s something we do for all of those that enjoy it. In saying that, I’m not saying that my other projects are purely for the money (laughs). The fans are always at the top of our minds. At events, they’re always asking us when the latest releases will be coming; we are always conscious of their expectations. Q: 2018 will mark the 20th anniversary since m-flo’s debut, and you’ve also done so many other things during this time. Did you ever imagine you’d still be rapping after 20 years? I never could have imagined it. Ever since the 90s, there was this very apparent difference between rappers and rock artists. Many prominent rappers seemed to have a deal of success with side businesses, and it became quite cool to do so. For example, Puff Daddy started both fashion and alcohol businesses, Rick Ross started selling champagne and Slim Thug even got into real estate. I always imagined myself following a similar path. When I did get around to trying it out, the attitude towards such a thing in Japan was quite cold. I was a bit lucky, though, since I was able to do it in conjunction with the office I used to work for. One person asked me “Can’t you just support your family through just rap, rather than with some other jobs?” I responded with a firm “No.” (laughs) I didn’t think it would be so realistic to be able to survive on rapping alone, so until my second album I was going to university in America, and would often go back and forth between America and Japan. I am constantly engaged in creative businesses, a recent example being the brand "AMBUSH®" I launched with my wife YOON. We opened a shop in Shibuya and it has been a great success. In the past, I would have thought I’d be done rapping when I hit age 30, but here I am beyond 40, standing on stage. Q: So not only has your musical world expanded, but so too your creative ventures. All of my experiences have been quite useful in everything I do. I can confront all of my ideas not only with the mind of an artist, but also with a realistic business sense. It’s been a blessing. I’ve been involved recently with the talent agency LDH to develop their international division. And just a little while ago, I met NAKED’s president Ryotaro Muramatsu together with Taku, and we talked excitedly about art and technology. I’ve been involved in so many ventures both within Japan and abroad, collaborated and networked with many artists and business partners, and I feel like I’ve achieved a real state of usefulness in the broader business world. Now, I want to take all of my own networking experience and spread it around for others to take advantage of. Q: What kind of creators are you inspired by? People with whom I get along well are those who look worldwide. It’s been like that since the very beginning. Those who are globally-conscious with unique ideas. They could be either a rapper or a business person, any profession is fine. It’s always fun to be around people like that, and it’s also extremely inspiring. It’s important to have strong synergy between myself and whoever I’m collaborating with, and I also want them to profit as well. If the other party wouldn’t gain anything, then I wouldn’t want to collaborate with them. If the collaborator doesn’t “feel it,” then it doesn’t really work out. I’ve seen a lot of those kinds of collaborations that didn’t work that well. For example, people with similar goals tend to bond quickly, for instance, myself and LDH’s EXILE HIRO. He has a strong philosophy in believing that the world can be happy through entertainment, and I completely agree with, and work with him. There are many people who really dig this idea for international collaboration, but at the same time those who do not. I’ve become better at sensing this, and I tend to be quite aware of other people’s motivations. Q: When you deliver collaborations and works to end users, are you conscious of the various generations and targets that are strived for? If I’m working with a brand or marketing, I think that it is possible to utilize information like ages, demographics and targets with data, but when making music, since I emphasize my own sense of being, I am not particularly conscious of any sort of data. Q: Recently in the music world, the ideas of "young people" and the "younger generation" are often emphasized -- what do you think about that? I think it should be “people with a young mind,” rather than “young people.” Regardless of age, no matter what you say to a person who is stuck in their ways, nothing other than a fixed concept sticks. Young, open-minded people were m-flo listeners, and I think that our music has stuck with them. It is with those people in mind that we continue to create. So I would like to continue to support such “young-minded” individuals. Actually, I want to create a platform where young people who are creatively hungry can be active. I have various ideas floating around. Q: Such a platform sounds pretty amazing. The experience of being in your twenties now versus when I was in my twenties is completely different. Like, now you can immediately learn new information from a smartphone. Nothing like that existed during my time, and making contact with others was tougher. I even remember Taku’s number from that time (laughs). The notion of having a dream is completely different now too. In the past, it was “Aim for million!” or “Perform at Kouhaku! (a popular end-of-year music show in Japan)” -- that was the romance of the music industry. Now, however, that same feeling is not there. I feel that there are many artists and creators who want to be more pure, flat and cool. If I had to guess as to why that’s the case, we now live in an age where it is not unimaginable that you could be booked at Coachella. Now, we are more free in our process, and that’s what is considered cool. Talking with the people who have been able to grow up and prosper in this environment is fun, and I want to support them. Q: So you are looking to nurture the next generation of artists? I am not good at any sort of “training,” especially when it comes to other people (laughs). I just want to make the platform. When I debuted, there were some cases where I thought “I want to collab with this overseas artist,” but I gave up because it was too difficult. I was told to go through some corporate representative, and it was kind of a pain. At least in my case, I just wanted to hurry through any barriers and get the work done. I’ve found other ways of doing it on my own now, and I feel the time is right to share my experience and know-how with others. I want to allow young Japanese artists who may say “I want to collab with that person” to easily turn that thought into a reality. If the possibility is there, the process will become smooth and fast. Creating a successful system to allow for this kind of experience is important. Q: Your work has been growing rapidly both in Japan and abroad, so what does your typical day look like? How am I spending my days recently? From early in the morning, it’s just meetings, meetings, meetings (laughs). I’m a bit of a morning person, so I’m still able to check my emails before my meetings begin, and then I end up really looking forward to my recordings and more creative work (laughs). Also, I make a lot of business trips overseas -- places like Shanghai and Los Angeles. I still make time to go to the gym 2-3 times a week though. In my accident, I broke eight ribs and was in rehab for a long time, so not being able to do weight training and running on the treadmill has been a little depressing. Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your future visions? Of course, I will be continuing to make music, but I will also be working hard on that platform. I’m very motivated by the possibility of being able to connect people, content, and business together. Q: Finally, who do you hope hears the music from the new m-flo? Firstly, I want to deliver this straight to the fans who have been waiting for so long. They’re like close friends, and people I could toast drinks with. It’s a “Thanks for waiting!” kind of feeling. Next, I feel like this release will be one that sticks to those open-minded people who are seeking new possibilities, so I hope that they listen too. I think they’ll be shouting “What?!” over the news of this 2018 m-flo resurrection, but in a good way. I really want to surprise them. I want to accomplish something new. Interview with LISA: Q: Can you tell us a little bit about how the three of you come to work on the new release? As in, how did I come to reunite with m-flo? Q: Exactly! Sure thing! It was around Christmas last year, Mercedes-Benz held a live show for a Tokyo-based radio station called J-WAVE. Up until then, I hadn’t really seen Taku for quite some time. Q: So you’d call it a chance meeting at this Christmas event? Up until that moment, we’d frequently call and talk on the phone, but this was our first time doing an event together in quite some time. It was an invite-only show hosted by J-WAVE, and I actually recognised a lot of people from the “Planet Shining” and “EXPO EXPO” days. They were kind of like my original fan club, so to speak. I was overwhelmed with joy to see them. It had been quite some time since I had last performed in Japan, so I thought most of my fans would have disappeared. While we were performing, I even saw people cry in joy -- even though so much time had passed, I wanted to live this moment again. I felt it was almost my mission to again bring m-flo together as a trio, rather than continue on solo. Q: So about how many of those old fans were actually at the show? It was closed event, and people were only able to get in via a lottery. So I’d guess around 150 or around there. Q: Would you say it was a very intimate party because of that? It was extremely special to me. I couldn’t help but feel nostalgic when seeing each person’s face. “Oh, I remember you. I remember you!” I saw the audience members crying, and I was close to tears even while singing some of my happier songs. Q: I’m sure those people would be happy to see this interview in that case. If they saw it, I’d actually be quite happy myself. They’re the ones who touched my heart so much. Q: It’s great to hear all about that event, thank you for sharing! More recently, would you say you’ve been making progress on an album? We’re actually working on several different types of songs at the moment, and we just recently finished a ballad. It’s going to be the ending theme song from an upcoming film called “Kyonen no Fuyu Kimi to Wakare.” It’s jam-packed with m-flo sounds, even if it is a theme song. It’s genuinely impossible for us to create something together that isn’t loaded with our true feelings. We’ve finished another song too, and it’s definitely very “us.” Q: What would you say the difference in being an m-flo member now is versus the time you were featured in the “Loves” series? We always had a role within the original m-flo days -- we knew what we had to do, and it was very natural for us. There was a very similar feeling to that in the “Loves” series too. This time, though, that feeling is even stronger. We have a greater sense of teamwork now than ever before. Q: How’d it feel to get back in the studio after all these years? We hadn’t been back in the studio together since the “Loves” series, and when we finally got back together, we realized so much time had passed, and we had all matured and become more experience with it. The messages in our lyrics got stronger, and what we would write felt more real than ever before. That’s something extremely important to me. As we’ve gotten older, our messages have too matured -- something I consider precious. I noticed even VERBAL was bringing in coffee for everyone, and being a total gentleman (laughs). I started to realize maybe it isn’t bad to get older, and I realized it’s always fun to be around Taku and VERBAL. Q: With all that said, what would you say m-flo is to you? We’ve all grown up, and we all have more mutual respect for each other. We know what buttons we shouldn’t push with each other now too. Both of them have jobs too -- Taku has his DJ’ing, and VERBAL has PKCZ®︎. For me, I only have m-flo, and sometimes I wish they’d focus more on the group. I feel that was especially because m-flo is essentially my home-ground. I’ve started to realize that more and more lately, and I’ve been on a mission to bring everyone back together. That used to be Taku’s thing, but now I feel like it’s my role to bring everyone together -- almost like a mother (laughs). Q: So what have you been up to as a solo artist? It’s been like 8 years, hasn’t it? I was honestly getting tired of repeating the same cycle over and over again -- I felt like I needed to stop. That doesn’t mean I haven’t been doing anything throughout those years though. I’ve gotten a number of offers from various labels, with the most recent actually being a collaboration with Taku for an English-language album called “KID’S SONGS.” Taku produced the tracks, and I provided the vocals. I have a pretty extensive library of music from the past 8 years, but listening to it now is heartbreaking. Q: Is there any chance that one of those songs might find its way into the next m-flo release? If it ends up fitting what we’re working with, then it’s a possibility. Q: Has your creative flow with m-flo changed since back then? It might not be the most polite way to say it, but I think that both Taku and VERBAL have really stepped-up recently. Taku’s tracks have become even more cool, and VERBAL’s raps have become even more melodic. His raps used to be a bit abstract, but now they have more of a West Side flavor. I frequently write my songs when I’m in Guam, I actually just flew ever there to listen to Taku’s second demo in a different environment; one that was fresh and full of sunshine. While I was there, the melodies and lyrics pretty much just fell from the sky, and I sent it all through to them. They absolutely loved it. Since I originally left, the two of them had gotten a lot more into DJ’ing and collaborating, while I spent most of my time listening to a lot of top 40 pop. So I bring a lot of the pop essence to m-flo, while they bring in their own unique aspects. We complement each other, and they trust me with what I create. Q: Would you say there any differences between your solo work and m-flo? I’m 100% dedicated to m-flo now. I’ll probably get offers from elsewhere for solo performances and such, but I would like to devote myself to m-flo entirely. That’s where I’m at right now. Q: What are you especially excited about in creating together again? Is there anything you’re looking forward to leading up to the release? I’ve been excited everyday as of late; there’s not a single day where I’m not listening to new music, and I can’t wait to sing in front of the fans. I feel like there’s astronomical possibilities with the three of us back together. I’m most excited to bring everything we’ve been working on to the fans and see how they all react. We’re all actually going on a kind of ‘songwriting camp’ abroad, which is something I came up with (laughs). I know the two of them are really busy, but I insisted we go anyway for just a week. I’m also really excited about that. Q: You’re going to be standing in front of an entire audience soon. What type of emotions are you expecting to stir? I wish I knew the answer to that, God only knows. I might even take a moment and cry if I’m honest. Q: How do you typically interact with your fans? Is there any particular routine? Let’s give an example, say I’m going to the concert hall by my house, there’s not some sort of ‘artist switch’ that I flick on and off. I just interact how I really am, I like to be as natural as possible. Being an artist is just part of my identity, so I don’t like to build walls between myself and m-flo fans. I try and be as honest as possible, and I hope others interact the same way. If I was to stop being real with myself and others, it’d break down everything we built. m-flo was never about putting up a front, it was just about showcasing who we are to the world. Q: There’s a whole lot of people all around the world who are ecstatic that the original m-flo trio are back together and are anticipating the album. How does it feel to know that? I’m delighted to hear that, of course. As we all know, the group continued to work hard after I left, and I couldn’t be more thankful towards Taku and VERBAL. Back when I was in the group initially, I wasn’t conscious of our international audience at all. I couldn’t imagine people listening to our music. I’m thankful that we were able to connect with individuals all around the world. All three of us went to international schools, so it only makes sense that none of us should limit ourselves to only Japan. If there’s anyone with interest in our works, I can only ask that you’re patient, and when the opportunity arises, you make it out to one of our live shows. I’d love to have you be there. m-flo was one of the pioneers in the bilingual English and Japanese music breakthrough in J-pop. However, I can also speak Spanish due to my Colombian origins, so I’d love to try creating something in Spanish and connect with our Latino audience too. Q: Can you tell us three things you like about m-flo? The first thing would have to be the mutual respect the three of us share for each other. We all understand our individual strengths as musicians, and that allows our real feelings to flow without compromise. The second thing would have to be the history we share. We’ve known each other since junior high, but even still after all these years, we can still get together and watch as our light glows strong. The third thing would have to be how much we’ve matured and flourished. It’s clear to all of us how in our new music our message is all the more powerful. Our music isn’t only for adults, but it ranges from youth all the way to the elderly — that’s just the flexibility of our style. That’s something special to me for sure. I feel like when I’m working with m-flo, we can truly do anything and go anywhere. Q: Finally, have you got anything special you want to say for your fans internationally? I’m overwhelmed with joy to be back involved with m-flo! It’s been so many years, but not once did I stop thinking about what we did. I just hope we have the chance to get back over to the United States, the Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, and everywhere else! I hope everyone has a chance to come see us, because our new music is seriously wow. I can’t wait for everyone to hear it. Thank you for always supporting us, I have so much love for you all. I’m back, and I hope you’re ready for what’s to come! I’ll see you guys all soon, and bless you all! Make sure to keep your eyes peeled for new music! For those of you that may have missed the highly-teased announcement yesterday, the tripod are officially back together and here to stay. With a new song on its way in 2018, we couldn't possibly be any more excited. To check out more of our previous write-ups, including yesterday's announcement, you can check our full archives here.

12515|2017-12-15|04:05|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/m-flo-new-single-w-lisa/| News | Music | LISA Returns to m-flo, New Music to 'come again' in 2018 | Announced today, m-flo's own original group member LISA is set to return for the highly-teased upcoming song 'never' featuring Takanori Iwata of Sandaime J Soul Brothers from EXILE TRIBE. |It's been over 15 years since we last heard the lyrical stylings of original vocalist LISA as a core member of m-flo joining Taku Takahashi's futuristic production values, and the hard-hitting lyricism of VERBAL on their album EXPO EXPO. Now, just in time for a major milestone for the group, the trio is together once again, and we couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Announced today after much, much teasing from the SNS accounts of everyone involved, LISA will be working alongside the group once more in the trio's latest single "never," which will also feature Takanori Iwata of Sandaime J Soul Brothers from EXILE TRIBE. The single, which is set to be utilized as the ending theme for the upcoming feature film "Kyonen No Fuyu, Kimi To Wakare," marks not just the return of LISA, but also the group's 20 year anniversary in 2018. The film is set to release in Japanese theaters March 10, 2018, so we also have that to look forward to as well. The track has been long teased by the trio in a number of cryptic ways, which is something even we were trying to decipher just a couple of weeks ago. Most recently we saw an update from the SNS accounts of m-flo which was perhaps the most blatant to date. Announcing a new Spotify playlist, I'll let you take a look at the track names yourself: If they were trying to be subtle, let's just say the three of them went about it the wrong way. "Next Year WE Will Release New Song For You As Three Members." The thing to note there was the use of the word 'members', over that of 'featuring' or 'alongside'. Now that the mystery is deciphered, however, we couldn't be more excited about the release of the single. With how long it's been since we last saw the group work as a trio, it'll be interesting to see the evolution of their signature m-flo sound. WE ARE BACK‼️ #mflo #LISA #VERBAL #TakuTakahashi#tripod pic.twitter.com/O4dDKGjR25 — m-flo_official (@mflo_official) 14 December 2017 You can, of course, expect to see exclusive interviews with Taku Takahashi, VERBAL, and LISA on OTAQUEST, so keep your eyes peeled for that.

12509|2017-12-13|14:00||http://otaquest.com/capcom-switch-support/| News | Games | Capcom Sees Switch as Home to Previously Unavailable Games | Capcom's CEO wants to make the Nintendo Switch home to a number of games previously unavailable on Nintendo consoles, it's recently been revealed. |In a recent interview with Japanese newspaper Nikeii, Capcom's CEO and Chairman Kenzo Tsujimoto discussed his desire to bring more of Capcom's expansive game catalog to the Nintendo Switch, including titles that had not previously been released on Nintendo consoles. The statement came after he admitted that the 'portable home console' nature of the Switch was working better than previously expected and that he would like to port more titles to it. With a number of Capcom titles that have never seen the light of day on Nintendo consoles, including that of Devil May Cry, Dragons Dogma, and a number of others, it's certainly good news for the platform. With both Resident Evil and Street Fighter now on the console, as well as the upcoming Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection which hits stores in 2018, we're finally starting to see movement on Capcom's behalf towards Nintendo's monolith console. With over 10 million units sold around the world in just nine months, and trajectories suggesting it'll outpace the Wii U's lifetime sales within its first year, it's certainly been a big year for Nintendo. We look forward to seeing what Capcom brings to the console leading into 2018. |Capcom, Nintendo, Switch, Video Games, Games, Nikkei
12507|2017-12-13|12:00||http://otaquest.com/pop-team-epic-teaser-trailer/| News | Anime , Manga | Upcoming 'Pop Team Epic' Anime Receives Two New Promo Videos | The self-described 'crappy-manga series' which turned into an overnight phenomenon here in Japan is going anime, and our first two promo videos are here in traditional 'Pop Team Epic' style. |It can be said with very little doubt in my mind that when it comes to the icons at the forefront of modern Japanese pop culture, the faces and crudely drawn middle fingers of both Popuko and Pipimi from Pop Team Epic are definitely up there. In what was almost an overnight revolution, the four-panel manga series went from niche nihilistic commentary on the world to nationwide sensation, remaining consistently relevant throughout the year 2017. For many, the series is most identifiable by the 2015-released Line stickers featuring the manga's two main characters. For others, it's through the original 4-panel series that offered us wonders such as the classic "God of Eurobeat" panel. In early 2018, however, there's about to be a whole new realm explored in way of the series' accessibility and the fanbase it reaches. With a January 6, 2018, release date scheduled (lest there be another sudden three-month delay), we're less than a month away from the much-anticipated Pop Team Epic anime. We're of course yet to see just how it'll look in any capacity, but we've finally got our first promo videos. When it comes to what you'd expect from a promo video for any Pop Team Epic-related material, I don't think there's anything more accurate than these two videos. Shot in the tourist-heavy Asakusa district of Tokyo, we find ourselves watching foreigners screaming very loudly in excitement and explanation for both fifteen-second and one-minute intervals. Cool. There's little explanation needed for the first video, though the summary of the second is that the individual talking is a fan of Japanese seifuku, and they go on to explain that their favorite anime is Basilisk, which results in both Popuko and Pipimi forcing them into the back of a bus. We're yet to receive our first glimpse at the anime in movement, and that only continues to raise a few questions. One particular detail that has me pondering is the studio handling it, Kamikaze Douga, have only been known in the past for their work on CG-anime. Does this mean we'll be seeing a full-CG anime to tackle the likes of both Popuko and Pipimi? If you're looking for an idea of what their previous and upcoming works look like, you might be familiar with a few of their previous works including the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure OP and the upcoming Batman Ninja film which we got a look at the other day. Either way, there's a lot of excitement mounting for the upcoming anime series, and we can't wait to see how it turns out.

The film is set to screen on both February 5 and 7, offering Japanese audio with English subtitles. The first of a three-part out-of-this-world experience, "Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1" takes us on an adventure through the eyes of Renton Thurston, riding into the skies and pursuing a simple love in such urgent times of war. Taking viewers deeper than ever before into the mysterious "Summer of Love" phenomenon that happened prior to where the original series kicked off, "Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution 1" is as visually and sonically charming as it is compelling. Calling on much of the original staff from the 2005 animated series, including the likes of Tomoki Kyoda, Dai Sato, and Kenichi Yoshida, we can't wait for audiences in the United States to experience the trilogy's first film. For those of you interested in checking further into the film, as well as the screening locations, be sure to check out FUNimation's official website, here.

12495|2017-12-11|12:00||http://otaquest.com/growing-up-in-nakano/| News | N/A | Growing Up In One Of Tokyo's Largest Subculture Hubs | A realm for every obsession, each more bizarre than the last. Nakano was where I was born, and Nakano is where I learned that the rest of the world is not Nakano. |Once upon a time between an alley leading into Nakano Sun Plaza and a local-branch of Yoshinoya, where a small pharmacist now stands, there used to be a timeless café by the name of Meikyoku Kissa Classic. Its leaning walls, old 78 RPM records, and horribly sweet coffee had been a haven for people wanting a reprieve from the overcrowded streets of Nakano for seventy glorious, long years. The café was something special for a long list of reasons. Having survived the bombings of World War II and the endless decadence of the early 90’s, however, it was finally torn down in 2005 when owner Yoshiko Mimasaka passed away. (A second generation location has since opened in Koenji carrying over all of the furniture and records. You can look for Meikyoku Kissa Renaissance to find it.) To this day, Classic is still one of my favorite spots in Nakano -- even a decade plus after its destruction. It represented many of the ward’s defining quirks. Tenacious, obsessive, obscure, mysterious, weird; it was a spot that defied time and space, almost as if it existed in a dimensional warp known only to the savviest of explorers. Nakano houses many of these worlds in its endless corridors and corners. A realm for every obsession, each more bizarre than the last. Nakano was where I was born, and Nakano is where I learned that the rest of the world is not Nakano. Walking through Sun Plaza into Broadway is like crossing the threshold of the regular human world to that of uncontrollable fantasy. The brightly lit shopping strip at the front is squarely a spot for families and hungry weekenders, unremarkable save for maybe the density of pedestrians in this age of dying shotengais. However, as you reach the end of the strip, you may begin to notice a few fast-footed geeks striding defiantly against the crowd to reach the gates of Broadway. There is a clear distinction that Broadway doesn’t reside in the same world from the get-go. A giant wall of rare doujins to the right, a used PC parts store to the left, and a general sense of eeriness to the dim lighting. Its still populated with people, but they seem to be here for a wholly different reason than the normals outside. You’ve just entered Broadway, the Holy Land of Subculture. From the very beginning, the Broadway building was fraught with complications. A whole book can be written on this subject alone, but the long and short of it is that it cost ¥60,000,000 to construct (in 60’s money no less) and had a laundry list of people with a finger in the same pie. One of which was the children of a former Japanese General who committed suicide after the fall of Imperial Japan. Incurring debt was like breathing air for the people attempting to maintain development, and construction had taken a large hit for it. With the grand design altered to favor both convenience and money for those involved, corridors inevitably turned into unintelligible spaghetti, with most corners leading to painful dead-ends. Storefronts are commonly hidden from pedestrians by random walls, and escalators and elevators are often placed in the most inconvenient locations for workers and customers alike. Its a far cry from what could have been. This was the late 80’s and early 90’s, a time when money was flowing in uncontainable streams. Shinjuku and Shibuya were booming, absorbing cash flow like a parched sponge, thus sucking up revenue from most of the surrounding areas. No sane business owner would set up shop here, much less make a profit. The chaos within the walls was much too untamable, the world outside much too alluring. That was, of course, until rent prices were so low that one individual couldn’t pass up on the opportunity. As those fortunate enough to have visited Nakano Broadway before may already know, a good 40% of the location is occupied by Mandarake, a used merchandise, and subculture haven. With a charming Kowloon-esque aesthetic and a penchant for scaring the life out of children, there's a whole lot to be said about the now legendary location. Founded by Furukawa Masuzo in 1980, the former comic creator-gone-psychonaut entrepreneur clearly envisioned something incredible when he modestly borrowed the initial 6.5 square meter share space that would become Mandarake. Filled to the brim with old comics, signatures of famous creators, and animation cells, the visionary was able to capture the ease of access to creators in nearby locations and bring a bit of their magic to the general public. As patronage increased, the tiny store grew steadily until he was able to incorporate in 1987, spreading like wildfire into the surrounding unoccupied spaces. Once he obtained the main space on the third floor, the entire building breathed a new life never seen before. メインのソフビショーケースは ほぼ完成。当日はうちにある在庫のベストラインナップで臨みます‼️ #sofvitokyo #mandarake #sofubi #sofuvi A post shared by MANDARAKE NAKANO SP7 (@mandarakenakanosp7) on Dec 10, 2017 at 5:36am PST I remember it clearly, the first time I went up that escalator to the third floor in Broadway -- it was nearly 20 years ago. The sheer amount of information being presented to me in one moment was enough to give me a fever that night. Since then, I've been totally obsessed with the place. It was a dark portal to every material thing that I’d ever want to be around in life. Mandarake was a catalyst for every niche hobby to find purchase in at Broadway. Stores that exclusively sold Warhammer 30k miniatures, weapon shops selling faux blades, tacky shirt stores, a dozen different branches of Recomints (now defunct), an arcade dedicated specifically to “poverty” fighting games, fashion doll stores, a real-deal military surplus store, a bookstore filled with poetry and leftist literature, a bookstore filled with really questionable pornography and more. It was the only place you could buy a rare Otomo Hiroyuki compilation comic, cross the path to get your fortune told, go upstairs to look at animation cells, and then go downstairs to the basement to get some bleeding edge Japanese fashion. The stores were strange because that building was the only place where they could thrive without judgment, not because they had any notion of strange subcultures being cool. Just as that sentiment was starting to turn on its head, however, Murakami Takashi began his expansion into Broadway totally changing what it means to be a nerd in the modern age. I am in @albrightknox Thank you @francoisodermatt @emmanuelperrotin This project had been take 5years! @sacaiofficial @thenorthface A post shared by Takashi Murakami (@takashipom) on Nov 10, 2017 at 6:27pm PST As Meikyoku Kissa Classic was beginning to be torn down, Murakami Takashi was in the middle of his big foray into becoming the pop art legend he is today. His DOB series was a giant success, and his collaborations with figure maker and sculptor Bome regularly netted billions of dollars in the art market. He had rebranded nerddom as profitable, using Superflat aesthetics to validate the previously socially embarrassing past-time. Murakami was a household name in Japan; from Louis Vuitton to Kanye West, he had permeated the zeitgeist of the 00’s in a deep way. One of the methods he used to retain a sense of currentness was to begin hiring prolific net illustrators and artists such as JNT, ob, and the now independent Chaos*Lounge crew to aid him in creating relevant work. In order to maximize the effectiveness of his new hires, Murakami opened Kaikai Kiki Gallery so that he could feature them and other internet-based artists in a fine art context, suddenly legitimizing an art form that was essentially no-brow. Something neither low for its subject matter or high for its commercial usability. Several new Murakami affiliated galleries and stores would pop up soon after, solidly ingraining his influence in the building. Almost overnight, Broadway becomes a hub for young artists and creators as a place to connect, research, and create. Nakano Broadway is where I learned to be a creator as well as a consumer. Its a place where subcultures collide and new worlds are born, bringing waves of new appreciators with them. Its a place I sincerely want the best for, and god willing, a long and healthy lifespan. As it stands, the new Murakami developments are bringing in new customers from around the world, all of whom I hope grasped the magic of Broadway. Every dim corridor, every nonsensical corner of this building should be protected, and every weird soul that resides it celebrated. May Nakano Broadway Live Ten Thousand Years.

It's a convention with much to offer, but perhaps the most alluring being the multi-day spanning "I Love Anisong" concert event. This year's event, in particular, was something special; calling on the likes of ClariS for their first international performance, as well as the likes of fripSide, and Konomi Suzuki. We'll get back to that last name in a second. Being at the convention under the "press" moniker, I was given the unique opportunity to interview the extremely talented Konomi Suzuki, perhaps best known for her works on the "No Game No Life," "Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World," and the "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou " theme songs. The barely twenty-one-year-old superstar has had quite the expansive career, spanning all the way back to when she won the 5th Anison Grand Prix in 2011 -- a competition designed to highlight the best within the field. Sitting down with the anison icon, we discussed a number of topics ranging from her expansive career as a musician, all the way to her advice towards younger musicians looking to get into the field. You can find the full interview below: It's a pleasure to speak to you today! Firstly, how do you feel about this year’s C3 AFA Singapore? I went to C3 AFA last year too, so I’m very happy to be back for a second time. Besides this event, Singapore is a city that is very special to me personally; I actually came here as a student on a school trip whilst studying. I'm beyond happy to have the opportunity to perform here! When it comes to songs you've performed, you specifically stated that "DAYS of DASH," the ending theme to "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou," is memorable to you. Can you tell us a little bit about why this is? When "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou" originally came out, I was still studying as a full time student. I felt like I could really relate with the characters within the show. "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou" is partly about running towards your dreams, and with "DAYS of DASH" being the second single, I put myself together in with the characters. It had not been that long since my debut, so it really felt like running towards a dream is what I was doing! When working on the theme song for "No Game No Life: Zero," the incredible "THERE IS A REASON," how did you find the creation process? When I saw "No Game No Life: Zero," I was actually in the audience with everybody else. On top of that, I was actually crying alongside everybody else. As a song, "THERE IS A REASON" is definitely very different to what I'm used to -- especially being more of a ballad than usual.The song certainly focuses on the love the characters have for one another, so I put a whole lot of raw emotion into the track. You are the voice actress for one of the main roles in the upcoming anime "Lost Song." Can you tell us a little bit about your character? Rin loves singing and she also loves to eat! Throughout the show you’ll see that her dream is to sing in a place called Oto. As "Lost Song" progresses, Rin meets more people and gains more experiences, so you witness a lot of her growth as a person. Please look forward to both Rin and "Lost Song!" Do you perform any sort of good luck ritual before a concert? I usually get really nervous before concerts, and it often gets to the point that the night before I can’t sleep and, on the day, I can’t eat. So I alway ask someone on my team to slap me on the back, really hard. That way, all the nervousness can get out of my body. After this is done, I feel like I can focus and do my best during my performance! In the early years of your career, did you encounter difficulty while establishing yourself in the industry? When I started off my music career it was very fun, however, there were a lot of hardships too. It was the same for me as it is for anyone starting off on a new venture. For example, when I was recording, it sometimes didn’t go as well as I would have hoped. Sometimes it was frustrating and, sometimes, I did cry quite a bit. But, because of that, songs have been created from all of those kinds of experiences. As an artist, you constantly have to keep up to ensure that you can share your work with the world. It is difficult, but I strive for a good balance. Drawing from your experiences in the past, do you have any advice for young aspirational artists who want to try and work towards a career related to their creative passion? If you think about it, realistically, pursuing your passion or dream is something very difficult. The key is to not fear that difficulty, simply put. Keep tackling it, and keep moving forward. When I first became a singer, I found that this was one dream I was able to take control of. But from that, I realised that I have so many more dreams! Pursuing dreams is something that we never stop doing. For those chasing their ambitions, my advice is to never give up. Ask yourself "Do you love what you’re doing?" If you do, then it is special to you and you should keep working on getting to where you want to be. Finally to cap things off, are there any artists who you would like to collaborate with in the future? The reason why I decided to pursue a career as an anison singer was because of Macross Frontier. If an opportunity arises, I would love to work with Sheryl Nome (voiced by Aya Endou) because she is someone who kickstarted my career. I want to give a special thank you to Anime Festival Asia, and in particular for them allowing us to conduct this interview. On top of this, I want to offer my eternal gratitude to Konomi Suzuki for being such a genuine and nice individual while taking the time to answer our questions.

Companies are seemingly giving it their all to ensure that their brand comes across the sassiest, as shown by the likes of the Wendy's, or even the most creative, as represented by the likes of Arby's. Well, now Adobe is stepping forward with their own take on the social media game, introducing their new chief advertiser: Maru the Shiba Inu. In celebration of the upcoming Year of the Dog, Adobe Systems has gone ahead and appointed the ever-important role of chief-advertiser to the incredibly Instagram famous good boy. With a little over 2.6 million followers on the Instagram platform, Maru is far from your ordinary dog. Tackling the role previously filled by clearly lesser humans, Maru is the perfect ambassador for more dog roles in the industry. In 2013 the fluffy entrepreneur proudly boasted his job to be enjoying the beach, though now he's clearly stepped it up in the professional business world: However this ends up going down for Adobe, we're definitely excited to see how it all paws out. To celebrate their newfound employee, they're currently running a design contest for a New Year's card featuring the small friend. By visiting the official website you can download your own template to get right into it. Here's a little picture of Maru being a good friend sitting in on one of the business meetings during the design of his very own New Year's card: P.S. If my New Year's card doesn't have Maru on it, I probably won't be hanging it up. Sorry. Source: Adobe|Adobe, Maru, Shiba Inu, Shiba, Dog

The announcement of Mega Man 11 was part of a livestream for the series' 30th anniversary. The new game will feature character designs by veteran character designer Yuji Ishihara. The game will be launching for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC at the end of 2018. Check out the trailer below. It seems that we can now finally forget about Mighty Number 9, as the true Blue Bomber is back to claim his rightful throne -- even if that is a strange thing to say considering that series creator Keiji Inafune worked on Mighty Number 9 and presumably not on this title. More information is slated to be revealed next Summer, but the trailer does certainly put some big gameplay tidbits on display, including the all-important powers. That block raining power? Just beautiful! Finally, in addition to the new game announcement, the company also revealed that the Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC would also be receiving all of the Mega Man X series games, and that the Switch will also play host to a release of Mega Man Collection 1 and Mega Man Collection 2 featuring the classic originals, complete with amiibo support. |Capcom, Mega Man, Gaming, Video Games, Games, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One

If you’re anything like me, finding some little way to show your support for your favorite series is something you strive to do, but does it always have to be through that flashy graphic tee? That small badge on your bag doesn't really cut it either, so now that’s where Japanese clothing labels like SuperGroupies come in. In a recent announcement from the brand, they detailed their latest piece with the ever-popular Cowboy Bebop -- a full, two-piece suit comprised of jacket and pants designed to mimic Spike Spiegel's iconic look, to an extent. Take a peek at some of the official modeling shots below. It's practically guaranteed the 'The Real Folk Blues' will begin to play every time you walk into a room. Tons of small details add up to give off airs of both true quality and high fashion -- the inside lining even utilizes the iconic backgrounds used in the series' opening. Those who preorder the 40,000 yen ($355 USD) set will also receive this special illustration from character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto. Who ever thought that we'd be getting a brand-new piece of Cowboy Bebop artwork after all this time? The SuperGroupies page for the suit can be found here. If you won't be in Japan for the planned March release date, you'd better start arranging for that trusty Japan-residing and order-accepting friend to help you out now, since the preorder window only runs through the 17th! Be sure to check out the brand's other wares as well -- they carry collaboration items for everything from My Hero Academia to Osamatsu-san to even Rozen Maiden!|Cowboy Bebop, Spike Spiegel, fashion, crossover, The Real Folk Blues, Shinichro Watanabe, Sunrise

That's pretty much exactly what we're getting with the upcoming DC x Warner Bros Japan anime film "Batman Ninja," an anime film that launches Batman and Joker into the Sengoku period of Japan's history. Calling on a seriously all-star cast to craft the film, we got yet another peek into just what we can expect via a new trailer uploaded today. The whole concept of the film is extremely promising, and that's only compounded by those working on it. Bringing onboard director Junpei Mizusaki (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Terraformars), screenwriter Kazuki Nakashima (Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill), character designer Takashi Okazaki (Afro Samurai, Summer Wars), and musician Yugo Kanno (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Pshycho Pass), we're thrust into a world of promise when it comes to what could be the greatest piece of Batman media to date. Removing his gadgets, we're left with Batman in his most vulnerable form; something perhaps underappreciated in other mediums. With nothing but a 2018 release window, we're left on the edge of our seats to see what comes next. Most of what we've seen so far has shown the film will be released in Japanese cinemas, but given its place of reveal being New York Comic Con, the trailers all containing English subtitles, and the fact that it's a Batman film, I wouldn't be too surprised if it received the international release it deserves.

12445|2017-12-01|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/junji-ito-anime-pv/| News | Anime | Upcoming Junji Ito Anime Series Gets First PV | The highly anticipated upcoming anime series from the master of horror himself, the aptly titled 'Junji Ito Collection,' has finally received its first PV ahead of its January 5, 2018, airdate. |There's not a single ounce of doubt in my mind that 2018 is going to be an incredible year not just for anime, but the wide variety of genres that the platform finds its basis. We're launching the year with an absolutely stellar lineup of content that covers just about every basis -- from the satirical nature of Bkub Okawa's own "Pop Team Epic," all the way to the adventure we're all about to undertake in series like "DARLING in the FRANXX," there's nothing left unexplored. One particular show I've been waiting for, however, is the horror-focused stylings of the much-anticipated "Junji Ito Collection." I've written at length about the upcoming series in the past, each time my excitement seemingly rising for the animated realization of some of my favorite manga. I don't like to ever say I've 'peaked' in excitement, purely because I very well know at this point that the world will always blow me away in some other way; that being said, if there was ever a 'peak,' this would have to be it. Uploaded directly to smiral animation's YouTube channel, we've finally got our first look at the master of horror's first animated series. Let's try and stomach it, with the video available to check out below: From the 1:20 playback time of the PV, there's definitely a whole lot to digest. From the series seemingly no-bars held approach to blood and gore, all the way to its twisted character designs -- it might just be the Junji Ito anime we've all been waiting for. Playing towards the later end of the PV we catch the OP for the series, stemming from Japanese rock band THE PINBALLS with their new track "Shittenbattou no Buruuzu" (Writhing Agony's Blues), a seemingly perfect title for such a series. We're now just over a month away from the series premiere and I don't see how I could be any more excited, even if I know this is only a temporary feeling. There's a lot of hope in this series, and I could only hope to see the terrifying pages of Junji's most important reads brought to the screen in gorgeous anime form. Set to premiere January 5, 2018, here in Japan, I can't wait to see how it all pans out. If you're interested in further information on the series, be sure to check out our full archive.

Those two games were Super Smash Bros. Brawl and BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger. At the time, the latter had a fairly modest character roster of just twelve members, but in the ten-year span that Arc System Works has continually developed and released the franchise on any and all platforms, it has grown to a mind-boggling thirty-six. Officially, it took seven major releases to reach this number, and we're not even counting non-playable characters found within manga, visual novel, and anime releases within the franchise. Now, an impossible task has reared its head: choosing a definitive favorite. Arc System Works is hosting a character popularity poll in preparation for the series' 10th Anniversary next year, and you can visit this page to cast your vote now, and once more every day until the polls close on January 31, 2018. All you have to do is click the blue '投票' button and confirm! The company will announce the results in early March of next year. It's not clear what exactly will happen in regards to the winning character, but perhaps we can expect an even more pronounced role within future series entries? Also worth considering is if this popularity poll will have any influence on who will be included in the 4-series mega-crossover BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle. After all, that game will feature characters from not only BlazBlue, but also the Persona 4: Arena series, Under Night In-Birth, and RWBY. I'm sure that game's planned roster is already crowded enough!|BlazBlue, Arcsys, Arc System Works, poll, Gaming, Video Games, Games

That being said, however, we now have official confirmation by way of Nintendo themselves that the Switch exclusive will be reaching the hands of gamers the world over when it releases... soon. Check out the trailer below, which is pretty much the same as the original Japanese trailer from a few weeks ago, but with official English subs: It seems that these days, any mention of the Shin Megami Tensei series falls mainly under the umbrella of the massively-popular Persona 5, rather than within the realm of the outwardly bleak and relatively complicated world of turn-based demon fighting RPGs the series found its genesis in. That's understandable, however -- the Persona spinoff series placed the grim task of collecting mythical demons into the hands of a bunch of stylish and (mostly) relatable teens, and turned that burden into a unique form of self-expression. Slickly-produced and full of character, it's no wonder the Persona games have found a wider audience, and that's OK. It remains an undeniable fact however that the audience is still there for a traditional SMT experience, as evidenced by the success of Shin Megami Tensei IV on the Nintendo 3DS. It seems Atlus are content then, in continuing the main series on Nintendo's consoles, and I'm willing to bet that the Switch's popularity won't be dwindling anytime soon, especially in light of this massive announcement. |Shin Megami Tensei V, Atlus, Nintendo, Switch, Gaming, Video Games, RPG, Games, tokyo

That's right -- four huge games in Square Enix's signature franchise were released in North America between September of 1997 and July of 2000. I knew that in the back of my head, but I did a spit take first and definitely had to do a web search to confirm that I wasn't delusional. Fast forward to the latter 2000s, and mainline Final Fantasy games seem about as frequent as actual good drops in XIV. In the current video games industry climate, I'm doubtful that a stream of releases of that caliber will ever occur again, but with the fortune and favorability of the franchise on the upturn once again, I am inclined to trust current series brand manager and former producer Shinji Hashimoto when he says that Final Fantasy is going to see a big next year. Check out the clip below from an interview that Edamame Arcade conducted with Hashimoto concerning the series' trading card game. This year is the 30th anniversary of Final Fantasy. There aren’t many things that go for 30 years. With the support of the fans of Final Fantasy, next year will be the 31st year, and our teams are busy working on new titles. They are all gearing up for a big year next year. Next year is going to be a big year. As the 30th anniversary of the franchise was this year, we saw the release of Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age, Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood, and big DLC updates to Final Fantasy XV. It's certainly going to be tough to follow that up with no foreseeable major releases on the horizon -- at least not yet. The major elephant in the room, of course, is the release of the first part of the Final Fantasy VII remake. If that somehow lands next year, I suspect most won't even care what else rears its head.|Square Enix, Final Fantasy, Games, Gaming, Video Games

Among the cryptic tweets from the group promising a surprise announcement at their 'revival' performance at the Universal Studios Japan Countdown New Years Party, as well as their sleek new artist imagery, there's a whole lot to discuss. It may seem like we ourselves would know all the answers to this, after all, we are a publication founded by m-flo's own Taku Takahashi -- though I assure you we don't. There's perhaps nothing Taku is more cryptic about than his work with m-flo. It all started with a tweet from Taku Takahashi's Twitter account made on November 22. It was straight to the point and didn't quite play around. The caption proclaimed "First day of recording for new #mflo," attached to an image of three pairs of glasses. It'd be fair enough to assume that the front and back pairs belong to both Taku and VERBAL, though who could that middle pair belong to? m-flo ver4 レコーディング初日 First day of recording for new #mflo pic.twitter.com/JNu6KZMbRJ — Taku Takahashi (@takudj) 22 November 2017 Two days later we get another peculiar post from Taku's Twitter account. He's a producer, producers post pictures of their studios all the time -- we get it. But one thing in particular that caught our eyes at the end of his tweet was the phrase " 次のエムフロウ" which you would translate to "The next m-flo." Huh, interesting that theme would appear again. That being said, the group's 20th anniversary is right around the corner. 自分の素直な気持ち良さを徹底的にあえて追求することにしてみてる。手グセ解禁。色々寄り道して出た結論。次のエムフロウ pic.twitter.com/1smQkJtbg2 — Taku Takahashi (@takudj) 24 November 2017 Jump forward a couple of days and we see some group related activity posted for the first time in a little while on the official m-flo Twitter account. This time, however, it's in the form of a new artist picture. It's everything you'd expect from a signature m-flo piece of imagery, all the way down to the glasses. Speaking of those glasses, there appears to be an open slot in-between both Taku and VERBAL; that's interesting. The duo is known for working alongside incredibly talented vocalists, so I'd dare take a shot at suggesting maybe we'll see somebody fill the spot. 【m-flo】#新アー写 公開しました‼️ pic.twitter.com/gnpkJqnDbl — m-flo_official (@mflo_official) November 27, 2017 Then, later on, that very same day we saw Taku quote-tweet the announcement that the group would be performing at Universal Studio Japan Countdown decreeing it an "m-flo revival" and promising a "special surprise" at the event. He then went further in saying that there's going to be even more activity from the official account, and to be sure to follow it to stay updated. 今年もUSJカウントダウンに出演します。しかもm-floとして。サプライズもあります。そして、m-flo復活にともない、 @mflo_official も活発に動いていくんで、ぜひフォローお願いします(´◡`๑) https://t.co/lApvUsrp2E — Taku Takahashi (@takudj) 27 November 2017 Shortly thereafter Taku would again go on to play with the hearts of fans, re-posting the groups latest imagery. This time, however, the image was altered with the words "Coming Soon..." layered over the top, and perhaps most interestingly, acknowledgment of there being a person in the middle. This was delivered through the image's caption "m-flo. Who is it going to be in the middle?" m-flo. 真ん中は誰になるか？ #mfloComingSoon A post shared by Taku Takahashi (@takudj) on Nov 27, 2017 at 6:15pm PST Staying true to Taku's prior comment, of course, today we saw this tweet go out from the official m-flo Twitter account announcing that we could expect further announcements come December 15 (JST). On top of that, we should all stay wired for what comes next. 12月15日に大事な発表があります！お見逃しなく#mflo — m-flo_official (@mflo_official) 28 November 2017 We've got a very important announcement coming on December 15 (JST).

In the meantime, however, you can bet we'll be wired to both their Twitter and Facebook accounts waiting to find out more.

12412|2017-11-27|20:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/itazura-majo/| News | Anime | Creators of 'Monster Strike' Are Releasing a Christmas Anime | Holiday-themed anime aren't all too common, but this newest project by game studio-turned multimedia producer is looking absolutely wild. |The saga of the Monster Strike anime has been a fascinating one to follow. Having always been an ONA, or an "original net animation" due to a shorter runtime and exclusive availability on streaming services, the show has dipped back and forth between familiar 2D animation and full 3D CG styles. Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that the current season of the anime, Monster Strike: The Fading Cosmos continues to be translated and shared by mobile games company XFLAG despite the English version of the game being shut down 3 months ago due to lackluster reception. Despite all this, I'm pretty excited to see where studio SANZIGEN (quite literally, studio 3D) will take this pretty cool-looking Christmas anime they just announced when they release it on XFLAG 's Monster Strike anime YouTube channel on December 1. Below, you'll find the episode after which the announcement trailer played, tagged to begin at the exact moment it starts. Give it a watch for some great-looking full 3D CG action! Look familiar? In the past, SANZIGEN have worked on other full CG shows like Arpeggio of Blue Steel - Ars Nova and most recently BBK/BRNK. Daizen Komatsuda, who directed the latter, will be returning as the director of Sorcery in the Big City. Taking place in New York City during the holiday season, it tells the story of Akari Kido, a Japanese police officer in training on an exchange program. While directing traffic, a mysterious sorceress summons a bunch of terrifying Christmas monsters, and just when it seems this proverbial snowfall of holiday freaks is about to ice Akari, a girl in a bear hoodie shows up to save both the day and the city. The one-off episode will be 40 minutes-long, and will debut in English on that channel on December 1 at 7:00 PM JST. For more, I encourage you to check out the official website here. It has a charming old-timey newspaper motif, and contains a ton of great art and character portraits. As far as I can tell, this is the only purely Christmas-themed anime on the horizon this year, so will you be tuning in? I mean, what else are you going to do? Re-watch that Toradora! Christmas episode? Indulge in the yearly Itsudatte My Santa! watch? Actually, do both of those things, but also be sure to give Sorcery in the Big City a fair shake!|Monster Strike, XFLAG, mobage, Itazura Majo to Nemuranai Machi, youtube, christmas, holidays
12410|2017-11-27|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/made-in-abyss-2/| News | Anime , Manga | Macabre 'Made in Abyss' Anime Returning for New Project | Akihito Tsukushi's masterpiece of creepy worldbuilding is getting the continuation it deserves, but we'll be waiting a while. |When Made in Abyss was announced to be receiving an anime adaptation almost one year ago to the day, fans of Akihito Tsukushi's deeply-atmospheric and oftentimes disturbing manga were justly worried about how studio Kinema Citrus would handle it. Filled with moments of genuine sheer terror, as well as a number of situations that you would never wish upon anyone as young and seemingly pure as the likes of Riko and her fellow Cave Raiders, it would be hard to please absolutely everyone who had read the original manga. When the show debuted this past Summer season, it proved to be quite the hit both in Japan and abroad -- Kinema Citrus triumphed in recreating the manga's eerie atmosphere, and maintained much of the same shock value from the manga without going overboard. Couple that with some amazing production work in both the music and translation departments with talent from abroad, and you had a recipe for success, despite even debuting on Amazon's "Anime Strike" service in the United States. It was decidedly cool to see Australian composer Kevin Penkin receive so much praise for Made in Abyss' orchestral score, and Akihito Tsukushi himself even publically tweeted out his support of the way English translator Jake Jung handled some tricky issues surrounding a character's gender: Thank you! The gender of Nanachi is unknown. When Nanachi was a human being, there was a gender, but it has not been revealed. Imagine it :) — つくしあきひと (@tukushiA) September 16, 2017 Good job! ! ( ⸗‵ ᴗ ‵⸗)b — つくしあきひと (@tukushiA) September 16, 2017 All in all, it made for an experience entirely deserving of rapid continuation, and it looks like we may just be in luck. At the "Deep in Abyss Katari" event in Tokyo this past Sunday, a sequel of unknown format was announced via the video seen below. It contains new voiced lines, and some slight spoilers to the first season of the anime, naturally. The continuation, whether it be a second season, a movie, or even an OVA, cannot come soon enough. I'm hoping that we are blessed with a date within the latter half of 2018 personally. Seven Seas has licensed the manga for release in North America. You can find their synopsis of the bone-chilling exploration thriller below. In an age when the corners of the world have been scoured for their secrets, only one place remains unexplored–a massive cave system known as the Abyss. Those who traverse its endless pits and labyrinth-like tunnels are known as Cave Raiders. A young orphan named Rico dreams of following in her mother’s footsteps as a Cave Raider, and when she meets a strange robot when exploring the Abyss, she’s one step closer to achieving her goal! |Made in Abyss, Manga, Akihito Tsukushi, horror
12411|2017-11-27|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/teddyloid-invisible-lovers-ia/| News | Anime , Music | TeddyLoid Releases New Song 'Invisible Lovers' Featuring IA | TeddyLoid has released the music video for 'Invisible Lovers' from his latest EP 'SILENT PLANET EP vol.5' featuring vocals from Vocaloid software IA. |TeddyLoid is the genius creative behind some of the most club-ready anime songs of all time; this is a fact that can't be argued. Some of his earliest works saw him crafting the genius that is "Fly Away" from GAINAX's 2010 animated series "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt," as well as remixing the lyrical stylings of LIA in "My Soul, Your Beats!" of "Angel Beats!." In 2014 the Tokyo-based producer would bring "ME!ME!ME!" to life in collaboration with DAOKO, a song that again dominated events around the globe. With a slew of incredible releases since then, we find ourselves at his latest "Invisible Lovers," a song produced while utilizing Vocaloid software to bring IA on-board for the ride. Plucked straight from TeddyLoid's most recent "SILENT PLANET 2 EP vol.5 feat. IA," "Invisible Lovers" is not just an excellent example of production ability, but a beautifully tuned showcase of Vocaloid software as a whole. Featuring a music video that breaks the barriers of both 2D and 3D realities, "Invisible Lovers" proves a hit time and time again. It's a departure from the hard-hitting club sounds presented in previous releases for sure, but there's a whole lot of charm to this latest release that has kept it on repeat all day. The four-track EP that "Invisible Lovers" stems from is available to check out now on iTunes and Spotify now. If you're yet to check it out, the first part of our interview series with TeddyLoid is available to check out below: |TeddyLoid, Invisible Lovers, vocaloid, IA, Music, electronic, SILENT PLANET

We now know when that date is with news coming out over the weekend slating it for an April 2018 airdate. Set to air every Saturday during the 5:30 pm timeslots on both Nippon TV and Yomiuri TV beginning April, the show is likely aiming to rise above the incredible past two seasons "plus ultra." Shared alongside the airdate announcement was an all-new poster for the series featuring illustrations from character designer Yoshihiko Umakoshi. The Studio BONES animated series has gone on to become one of the biggest breakthrough shows around the globe, with each season continuing to hit harder than the last. Originally serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump in July 2014, the Kohei Horikoshi original manga series was an immediate hit with fans. Proving to hold a lasting level of success in both manga and anime form, we're beyond excited to see what the future holds for the "My Hero Academia" series. If you're yet to check it out, Crunchyroll has made the English sub of the series available on their platform. |My Hero Academia, Boku no Hero Academia, MHA, BNHA, JUMP, Shonen Jump, Viz Media, Funimation

The Nintendo-raised pink ball of joy is enjoying its 25th anniversary throughout the year 2017, and with the new "Kirby: Star Allies" title slated for a Nintendo Switch early 2018, there's never been a better time for celebration. That's where Tokyo Otaku Mode's latest product comes into play, bringing the faces of both Kirby and Meta Knight to life in the form of incredibly crafted leather key covers. The "Kirby 25th Anniversary Pupupu Leather Key Cover" combines real leather with iron clasps and nylon stitches to give off an adorably rugged effect that's set to arrive just in time for the new games release. Made in collaboration with OJAGA DESIGN, the Nintendo licensed product is definitely something we're eyeing pretty hard. It's tasteful, it's stylish, it's Kirby; count us in. Though the product is a few months off, set for an April 2018 release, you're able to lodge a pre-order via the Tokyo Otaku Mode website, here. It'll be available for all countries around the globe and is currently priced at 5,440 yen a piece with their current promotion. The products will also be made available in department stores and other retailers across Japan, so it'll be worth keeping an eye out there too. What are your thoughts, does a leather Kirby key cover sound appealing to you? I'm not usually one to carry my key outside of my wallet, but perhaps that's something that'll need to change come early next year. |Kirby, Meta Knight, Tokyo Otaku Mode, TOM, Keycover, Key Cover, Nintendo, Hal Laboratories, HAL

Works Kicks Off Today | Beginning with three recap films and ending with a new TV anime, the 'Full Metal Panic!' franchise is going to have a banner year! |The news that the Full Metal Panic! series was finally getting a new entry certainly made a splash when it came to light last year, but that much-anticipated TV anime won't actually hit the airwaves until Spring of 2018. What does appear to have slipped under the radar for the most part, however, seems to be the three "Director's Cut" films. The films are, for the most part, comprised largely of the original 2002 anime's footage. However, some brand-new cuts and drawings have been interspersed throughout the films, and the official FMP site revealed a nice chunk Part One's new cuts. Check them out by scrolling through the gallery below. Full Metal Panic! Director's Cut 1st SECTION: "Boy Meets Girl" begins a very limited theater run in Japan today. You can catch the film for one week only at one of three locations -- Kadokawa Cinema Shinjuku, Tokyo; Tachikawa Cinema City, Tokyo; and Umeda Burg 7, Osaka. You can also check out the film's trailer below. Once 1st SECTION wraps up, you can expect both 2nd SECTION and 3rd SECTION to screen on January 13, 2018 and January 20, 2018 respectively. All theater-goers will be entitled to a wonderful new drawing by the light novel series' original illustrator, Shikidouji. 「フルメタル・パニック！ディレクターズカット版」入場者プレゼント情報！ 第1部「ボーイ・ミーツ・ガール」入場者プレゼント『四季童子先生描き下ろし特製ミニ色紙（宗介＆かなめ）』イラストを公開です。 (※無くなり次第終了となります） https://t.co/gP56YQrQU9 #fmpiv #フルメタ pic.twitter.com/7gtl4Q2LUN — TVアニメ「フルメタル・パニック！IV」 (@fullmeta_iv) November 9, 2017 Fans will not have to wait long at all after being caught-up on the events of Full Metal Panic! and (presumably) Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid, as the fourth season will finally see the light of day next spring as Full Metal Panic! Invisible Victory, which is cleverly shortened to FMP: IV, or "four." Neat! Katsuichi Nakayama, who previously worked on the likes of Bodacious Space Pirates and Evangelion 3.0: You Can (Not) Redo, is directing the series at Studio XEBEC. It's comparatively shiny, new and pretty, similar to the new cuts shown above. I'll leave you now with the trailer for IV, so that you can bask in the return of one of anime's most beloved action comedies one more time. It sure is going to be an incredible year to be an FMP fan! Full Metal Panic! - official site|Full Metal Panic!, Xebec, Film, director's cut

The album was set to neatly package all of the rising artist's songs from her major debut up until now, offering a total of 14 tracks made available in either standard or limited edition format. Uploaded today to DAOKO's official YouTube channel, we get a peek into the limited edition version of the album which includes seven music videos in total. For the now 20-year-old singer and rapper DAOKO, the second album couldn't possibly come at a better time. Perhaps for many, their initial encounter with her lyrical workings was the 2014 electropop spectacular "ME!ME!ME!," a song made in collaboration with TeddyLoid. More recently than that, however, DAOKO was launched into the world of mainstream superstardom here in Japan following the release of her single "Uchiage Hanabi," a song made to accompany the 2017 "Fireworks, Should We See It from the Side or the Bottom? " anime film. Set to be included in the limited edition of the album is the following: Music 01. 打上花火 （DAOKO × 米津玄師）// Utagi Hanabi (DAOKO x Kenshi Yonezu) 02. ステップアップ LOVE（ DAOKO × 岡村靖幸）// Step Up LOVE (DAOKO x Yasuyuki Okamura) 03.

Throughout those twenty-seven long years, both the anime industry and the way it's consumed have undergone some pretty major changes. While we're not saying there's no room for the property in the year 2018 -- because we're absolutely not -- it takes a certain level of faith in a series to revive it after so long. But if there's anything worthy of such faith, it would most definitely have to be Devilman. Set to release on Netflix January 5, 2018, Devilman Crybaby is a beast of a way for the streaming giant to flex their muscles (and wallets) in showing how serious they are about their stake in the anime industry. With music from Japanese supergroup Denki Groove blasting throughout the trailer, we're teased with one of the series' most hype-inducing trailers to date. The Masaaki Yuasa-directed anime spectacular has long topped people's must-see lists since it was first announced over five months ago. With a slew of high-quality works under his belt including Ping Pong and The Night Is Short, Walk on Girl, it shouldn't come as much surprise as to why there's so much buzz surrounding this anime.

12388|2017-11-22|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/hidden-secrets-anime-expo/| News | Anime , Manga , Music , Games | The Hidden Secrets of Anime Expo - What You Need to Know | There are an overwhelming amount of activities going on at Anime Expo every year, but here are some of the things you might not have known about. |We're nearing the end of 2017, and that basically only means one thing -- Anime Expo 2018 is just around the corner. It's a yearly pilgrimage for just about any anime fan around the globe, making their way to the Los Angeles Convention Center for the multi-day spectacular that we've come to know and love. With how much that goes on within those days, however, it comes as no surprise that there are a few gems that fly under most peoples radar, and we want to make sure you know what they are: 1. Acoustikaraoke I'd like to hope it comes as little surprise when I mention the cultural importance karaoke holds here in Japan. Possibly one of the most important pastimes over here, karaoke is considered by many to be the cornerstone of a good weekend. But what if that two-hour session could go even further -- what if we could build upon it, building it into something even more. That's where "Acoustikaraoke" comes into play at Anime Expo. Offering the opportunity for attendees to showcase their instrumental and ensemble ability through live performances, acoustikaraoke builds upon the foundations laid by traditional karaoke, making it an event worth your time in checking out. Find more out about it here. 2. Art Show Exhibition Been hard at work but perhaps still not ready to push your art through to the Artist Alley? That's where the Art Show comes into play. Offering a space for up-and-coming creators to showcase their latest works, the Art Show is absolutely somewhere to visit if you're looking to support the next-generation of creatives, and especially if you're looking to create a voice for yourself. Find more out about it here. 3. Anime and Manga Studies Symposium Looking to branch out from the ordinary discussions between fans of anime? Perhaps looking to dwell beyond the surface, and dig a little deeper into just what "anime" means in a modern context? That's where Anime Expo's "Anime and Manga Studies Symposium" comes into play. Offering integral discussions about anime is a global medium, you'll be able to join fellow academics and the general public to discuss the history and themes of various anime, all whilst having your voice to be heard. If you've got a point that you're keen to share, you'll definitely want to check out this panel. Find more out about it here. 4. Career-Oriented Workshops In the year 2017, and perhaps even more-so in the year 2018, the prospect of working in the anime industry is becoming more and more achievable. With the acknowledgment that global audiences are wanting to make the next big move, panels like "Career Workshops" are becoming more and more essential in bringing forward fresh ideas across the industry. For those interested in making a splash in the fields of ADR engineering, subtitling, or game localization, this panel is absolutely for you. 5. AMV Chef Even before the very concept of Food Wars, young creatives have been cooking up fresh recipes for various AMVs (Anime Music Videos) across the internet. "AMV Chef" calls on the best of these creators to give it their all in creating something amazing using a grand palette of pre-determined clips within a set amount of time. It's an intense battle between the greats and is guaranteed to be a total riot for those attending. For both fans of AMVs and budding creators alike, this is absolutely an event not to be missed. Find out more about it here. 6. Cosplay Poker Feeling particularly lucky while dressed as your favorite character? Then maybe it's time to give "Cosplay Poker" a try over at the tabletop gaming area. Offering an environment for both those in and out of cosplay to play their hand at a tournament-style game of No-Limit Texas Hold 'em, there's countless opportunity for a fair hand at fun over at this table. 7. Meet the SPJA Board of Directors Looking to voice a recommendation or concern regarding the happenings around Anime Expo? Well, this is absolutely something to check out. Run in a round-table format, attendees of the convention are invited to share their recommendations and queries with the staff and organizers of North America's biggest anime convention. With Anime Expo 2018 set to take place from July 5 - July 8, we're rapidly approaching one of the biggest events of the year for fans of Japanese culture and Anime as a medium. These are just a small sampling of the events that take place at Anime Expo, but they're also something that should definitely be highlighted just a little more.

I couldn't do it then, and even now I can't stress enough my belief that the Tokyo-based designer is quite possibly one of the most forward-thinking creators I've stumbled across. This belief, in particular, shines extremely bright in the long-awaited second season of his collaboration with PUMA, which we finally got to feast our eyes on today. It was about a week ago today that I made my way to Harajuku's PUMA locale to pick up a copy of the collaborative zine that just released to tease the upcoming collection. It was filled with GraphersRock's usual internet-tinged designs and flavor, but I don't think there could have been anything that would prepare me for what was to come. If GraphersRock's "Turn on Tokyo" sneakers were the cutting-edge of sleek, internet-age fashion design, then this new season must be the pinnacle. It's a six-piece accumulation of everything I'd come to know and love about their designs, all while dashing in a breath of fresh air through the use of both color and cuts. I could rave on forever about the smallest details, but none of it would ever do the collection any justice -- unlike these pictures. Tsugi Kori by GraphersRock // 2 Colorway // 16,000 Yen + Tax Disc Blaze Leather by GraphersRock // 2 Colorway // 20,000 Yen + Tax GraphersRock Woven Jacket // Black // 30,000 Yen + Tax GraphersRock SS Tee // Black // 9,000 Yen + Tax GraphersRock Sweat Pants // Black // 18,000 Yen + Tax Back Pack by GraphersRock // Black // 18,000 Yen + Tax Set to release December 2, 2017, here in Japan, you can absolutely expect to catch me in line to get my hands on a few choice pieces from this collection. From the announcements made online, it definitely seems like there isn't going to be an international release, but that could of course change with given time. Much like previous releases, you'll be able to pre-order the collection from 19:00 on December 1 via the online store, and there's also set to be a release event at PUMA's Harajuku locale.

Bringing our own co-founder, Dai Sato, over to one of the internets largest anime communities, we allowed fans worldwide to buzz him with any questions that they may have had. In total, we got a total of over 35 questions answered spread across a wide variety of topics from Dai's dream projects, all the way to his fascination with anchovies on pizza. In an effort to make the whole thread a little bit more accessible to everyone, we've gone ahead and compiled all of the questions and answers presented in the thread right here. There's a lot of questions that we've been dying for people to know, and perhaps even more which we didn't even know ourselves. Having been the script-writer behind series such as Eureka Seven, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and a number of others, it comes as no surprise that we got some genuinely incredible questions, and we couldn't be more pleased with the answers Dai so happily shot back.

The voice actress was found unconscious in her car along the Shuto Expressway here in Tokyo, with both her seatbelt fastened and hazard lights enabled. It's being reported that Hiromi Tsuru passed away due to an aortic dissection. It's currently unclear when this occurred. After being rushed to the hospital she was shortly thereafter announced dead. Born in Yokohama, Japan, Hiromi Tsuru had been working in the industry since 1978 when she was only 17 years old. It wouldn't be until the 1980s that the young Hiromi Tsuru would truly blossom into the phenomenal voice actor we all remember her as, following on from an enormous string of high-profile positions. With roles in series such as Dragon Ball as Bulma and Child Piccolo Jr., all the way to Anpanman's own Dokin-chan, the voice actresses voice was heard near and far. Our condolences go out to the family, friends, and fans of Hiromi Tsuru, and we hope she may eternally rest in peace. |Dragon Ball, Bulma, Hiromi Tsuru, Voice Actor

12338|2017-11-16|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/final-fantasy-yamanote/| News | Games | Tokyo Train Line Going All Out in Final Fantasy Collab | Catch a few rides on Tokyo's Yamanote train line to collect fan-favorite 'Final Fantasy' characters, and clobber a few bosses while you're at it. |Have you heard of the newest Final Fantasy game? No? You can't let yourself be the only person not playing FFYL! That's right, Final Fantasy Yamanote Line was just released by Square Enix and JR East Japan. All aboard the hype train! Come to think of it, those JR guys must be new developers; I've certainly never played one of their games before. What's that? JR actually stands for "Japan Railway"? The Yamanote Line is a commuter loop line in Tokyo? Alright, that's enough playing for me. While it is a bit unfortunate that not everyone will be able to take part in this latest Final Fantasy experience, I think that it is pretty easy to admit that it's a neat concept that will certainly prompt a number of people to explore Tokyo outside of the few train stops they're used to. Take a peek at the video below for an overview of the promotion. You've probably realized that FFYL is not actually a game per se -- it's not even a full-blown mobile app. Instead, you'll be navigating the landscapes of the fabled Yamanote Sen through your phone's camera and web browser. At each of the 29 stations of one of Tokyo's busiest train lines, you'll find a poster representing a different Final Fantasy game, complete with its own unique QR code. Scan the code to acquire that station's stamp and other assorted freebies, like wallpapers for your phone. Furthermore, if you scan one of the special boss posters located at 15 of the stops in nearby establishments like Atre department stores and other JR retail centers, you'll be able to Tweet out an attack against that boss! Each Tweet deals damage, so you are basically working together with all the other participants in Tokyo to take them down. If any given boss is defeated over the course of the campaign, November 15 to December 27, then everyone will receive an official wallpaper as a reward. So there you have it. FFYL is not an expansive mobile gaming experience by any means, but it does sound like a fun little excuse to complete a loop around Tokyo. If you happen to be visiting the city around this time, then I can't think of a better excuse to hit up all of the Yamanote Line stops!

12352|2017-11-16|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/darling-franxx-key-visual/| News | Anime | 'DARLING in the FRANXX' New Key Visual, Story Revealed | Studio TRIGGER and A-1 Pictures upcoming animated series 'DARLING in the FRANXX' has just received a new key visual and had its story explained. |It was just a few short days ago that -- after much waiting -- we received our first look at TRIGGER and A-1 Pictures' upcoming animated series "DARLING in the FRANXX" through its first preview. Included in that video was a January 2018 release window, as well as a full detailing of the staff that would be involved in one of our most anticipated animated series since its announcement at Anime Expo 2017. One thing that was missing, however, was just what the anime would actually be about, to which we now know the answer. Special thanks to @pKjd for the internationally viewable upload. Set in an ever-distant future, we find our main characters in a desolate reality with their only safe haven being the mobile fort city "Plantation." Within the confines of Plantation exists the area of Mistilteinn, perhaps better known to many as "birdcage." Without knowing anything of the outside world, children live within the confines of birdcage locked in constant battle to fulfill their missions. Pitted against unknown giant lifeforms known as Kyoru, the children must pilot their Franxx to defeat these beings. To the children within birdcage, piloting their Franxx provides validation for their existence. Once viewed as a prodigy by many, Hiro, perhaps better known as Code:016, struggles to find the validation he once knew all too well. That was until the mysterious girl known as "Zero Two" came into the picture. With just over two months between us and one of the most anticipated anime of the Winter 2018 season, there's certainly a lot of excitement behind the project. With Atsushi Nishigori helming the project, however, it's almost natural to say that the show is in extremely safe hands. We did a full listing of the staff for the upcoming series, as well as a preview video breakdown in our last post, which can be found here. We absolutely can't wait to see what comes of the show and will be sure to keep you all updated as further information is released.|Trigger, A-1 Pictures, Darling in the Franxx, Key Visual, Atsushi Nishigori

12337|2017-11-14|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/maison-book-girl-ai/| News | Music | Maison book girl Calls on AI to Write Latest Song | Four-member idol unit Maison book girl has called on artificial intelligence to write the lyrics for their latest song, 'cotoeri.' |It's not often I'm taken aback by the sheer genius of an idol song, however, you can always leave it to a group like Maison book girl to pull me further away from that notion. If music is an art form, then it should be willing to take the same unorthodox risks that other art forms would take -- and I truly feel like the essence of that very risk-factor is captured in the group's latest single, "cotoeri." For producer and songwriter Kenta Sakurai, constantly experimenting with the boundaries of what the industry will allow appears at the forefront of his attention, and it's through Maison book girl that he achieves this. In "cotoeri" he takes this a step further, utilizing the power of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create the idol group's latest single. Let's take a dive into just how he made this happen. With the power of AI, Kenta Sakurai fed through the lyrics of all of his previously-written songs for the group, also including ten new words too. What the AI spat out was its own take on the lyrics, sorting a random assortment of lyrics into what it considered the ideal song. While it's not exactly the most coherent of lyrical workings, the seemingly confused presentation of words fits the idol group quite well. So no, it's not a case of poor English-language translation in the subtitles -- that's just the output of the coteri AI. Bringing those lyrics together is the incredible vocal work of Maison book girl, giving the AI-born lyrics an extremely human edge through their presentation and attention to detail. Transforming computer-generated poetic nonsense into an entire song, "cotoeri" is absolutely something I can get behind. Set to release December 13, 2017, you'll be able to check out even more about the inner-workings of the release via its official website.|Maison Book Girl, AI, Artificial Intelligence, cotoeri, Idol, Music, Maison Book Girl Cotoeri
12327|2017-11-13|17:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/little-witch-academia-exhibition/| News | Anime | Little Witch Academia's Yusuke Yoshigaki Gets Tokyo Expo | Come to Tokyo this November to peek keyframes and illustrations for the beloved series by animator Yusuke Yoshigaki. |Yusuke Yoshigaki has played a crucial role in bringing some of anime's most beloved stories to life. He began his career at Gainax almost immediately upon graduating from the prestigious Yoyogi Animation School in Tokyo, the oldest institution of its kind in Japan. Working primarily as a key animator -- one who draws the "genga," or keyframes, of any given piece of animation -- Yoshigaki has laid the groundwork for the many breathtaking scenes we've seen in many Gainax anime like FLCL, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. When many of his peers decided to leave Gainax for greener pastures, Yoshigaki followed suit by joining Studio Trigger with his close friend and fellow key animator Hiroyuki Imaishi. There, he would go on to work on key animation for When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace, and of course, most recently, Little Witch Academia. Now, an upcoming exhibition in Tokyo aims to shed even more light on Yoshigaki's work on the series. SF gallery. in Nakano, Tokyo, will host the "Yoshigaki Yusuke Gengaten - The Art of Little Witch Academia" exhibition from November 16 to 28. The exhibition will be open every day, except Wednesdays, from 1:00 pm until 9:00 pm JST. Entry is free of charge. You can expect to see not only original genga, but also character design sheets and a plethora of Yoshigaki's private sketches and drawings. A one-man exhibition such as this is certainly no small deal, and in their official news release, Studio Trigger spared no words of praise when it came to Yoshigaki's accomplishments. Carefully surveying and observing - packing tons of ideas into one drawing. Layouts that make us feel the drama even outside the realms of a frame. For 20 years, he has been acquainted with Hiroyuki Imaishi, who has described him as the "ideal animator." If you are going to be in Tokyo over the course of the next month and are also a Little Witch Academia fan, then I can't think of a better way to spend zero money on what is shaping up to be a truly special bit of anime tarriance. |Little Witch Academia, Studio TRIGGER, Yusuke Yoshigaki, sakuga, Animation, key animation, keyframes, genga, event, Expo, exhibition, tokyo

It's a trend that seemingly gained traction with Capcom's Vs. series, and has now become an integral part of keeping each iteration of any given title fresh and compelling to pick up and play. In the past three years though, we've seen the likes of Cloud Strife of Final Fantasy VII join the ranks of the Super Smash Bros. brawlers and the cast of Rooster Teeth's RWBY step into the ArcSys fighting game universe in BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. There has been one game throwing curveballs pretty consistently as of late, however, and that trend shows no signs of slowing down. Coming a few months after the announcement that Geese Howard of Fatal Fury fame is to join Tekken 7, we've been hit with another huge Final Fantasy bombshell. Noctis Lucis Caelum from Final Fantasy XV enters the Tekken 7 ring! Wielding his signature Engine Blade, Noctis is ready to deal heavy hard-hitting blows as he takes on the likes of Yoshimitsu, Devil Jin, Jack 7, and the rest of the Tekken 7 fighters when he enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament in spring 2018! How on (Eos) did Lars get Noct's number? I'm pretty sure they don't even live on the same planet! Noctis will be introduced to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC versions of Tekken 7 as downloadable content in Spring of 2018. In addition to the Hammerhead stage clearly visible in the reveal trailer, I'm extremely hopeful that a fishing minigame will finally be introduced into the Tekken universe.

12328|2017-11-13|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/miku-figures-good/| News | Anime , Manga , Music , Games | Hatsune Miku Prize Figures Are Getting Really Great | For the longest time, I turned a blind eye to Hatsune Miku prize figures at arcades. That all changed when summer time came around. |In all my time living in Japan, never before have I been so attracted towards trying my hands at winning a prize figure -- let alone a Hatsune Miku prize figure. Not to say there's anything wrong with the Hatsune Miku character; I've been a long-time Vocaloid fan with no plans to change that anytime soon, but when it came to the world of Hatsune Miku arcade prize figures, it's almost always felt kind of... lacking. That was, of course, until the "Hatsune Miku Seasonal Series" was launched by Taito earlier this year. There's so much charm to a virtual idol that can be shaped into anything the mind could imagine, but until recently, I felt as though that charm was completely absent. That being said, with the three releases for Winter, Autumn, and Summer that have already surfaced from the creative minds at Taito, I might be chewing my words sooner than I initially thought. Calling on the talents of some of the best emerging illustrators around, Taito is re-inventing the way I've been viewing prize figures one season at a time. Kicking this adorable new line of Hatsune Miku figures was @ hechima10040 with the Winter 2016-released Snow Miku figure made in collaboration with Taito. Transferring the original illustration to a gorgeous PVC figure, we were graced with what would be the first piece in this wonderful, wonderful series. You can check out a comparison between the original illustration and the figure below: They kept us waiting a short while for this one, seemingly skipping over the Spring season with a "Coming Soon" notification filling its spot on the series website, but the quality of the @_NaokiSaitou-illustrated Summer figure completely made up for this. The first figure I managed to get my hands on from the collection, and arguably one of my favorites, the Summer Miku is absolutely something to be desired. You can check out a comparison between the original illustration and the figure below: Last but not least in the current three-piece collection, we're blessed with the latest Autumn-themed Hatsune Miku which was illustrated by a personal favorite creator of mine, @ MikaPikaZo. Packed and ready for vacation, the latest figure in the collection offers a stunning red look to contrast Miku's signature blue hair. I've dropped a disappointingly large portion of my paycheque into trying to win this figure and can't wait to finally call it mine. You can check out a comparison between the original illustration and the figure below: With the Winter season rapidly approaching here in Japan, there's no knowing whether or not we'll see yet another Winter-themed Miku figure of the same series, or if Taito plans to skip over the season and wait it out until Spring. One thing I do know, however, is that I'm totally obsessed with this new line of Hatsune Miku figures and can only hope this trend continues onwards for the foreseeable future.

Nonetheless, I'm sure it'll pack the same energy the original series did, and one could only hope it may even lead to a second season for the show. With just over a month and a half until 2018, we're sure we'll be seeing some more news on the OVA sooner rather than later. When that news does break, you can bet we'll be all over it.

Whether you've been tearing through Atlus' latest masterpiece in the demon-collecting Persona franchise, playing the latest DLC episodes of Final Fantasy XV, or even indulging in the tranquilizing atmosphere of Blue Reflection, the genre has offered something for everyone recently. Though, if you were to ask me about a series that I've seen the most raw passion for recently, that honor would undoubtedly go to Falcom's 'The Legend of Heroes' series. The games have not appeared on the cutting-edge of video game platforms, at least not with the titles released outside of Japan so far. Instead, the story of the current "Trails" chapter of The Legend of Heroes begins with 2004's The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky for Windows PCs. It was released on the PlayStation Portable 2 years later. Spanning seven other games, the latest arc known as Trails of Cold Steel has seen its most recent overseas releases on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. Only with Trails of Cold Steel III has the series finally made the jump to the PlayStation 4 and the current generation of consoles. That game is scheduled for an international release next year. In addition, all of these titles have seen, or will soon see a release on PC. Falcom released their financial results for the fiscal year that ended September 30, and have used that unusual platform to offer some exciting announcements. After Trails of Cold Steel III is released overseas, don't expect that to be the end of the story. The company has indicated that it will continue on the PlayStation 4 with a brand-new title, to be released during this fiscal year. In addition, Trails of Cold Steel I and II are receiving PS4 ports, bringing the whole tetralogy to that platform. There's been no word on exactly what enhancements these ports will bring, but I think that it's safe to assume that they'll look even prettier. The series has featured a massively-interwoven tale and some of the most engaging tactical action and turn-based hybrid RPG gameplay I've ever had the joy of experiencing. Top that off with engaging characters and a tinge of humor, and you have yourself an adventure that more-than-deserves to be experienced by a wider audience. It's absolutely fitting, then, that some of the series' biggest fans, and Falcom evangelists in general have taken to using the hashtag #FALCOMHIVE when announcements are made or they discover brand-new players getting into the series. It's a community of positivity that I wish I saw more of within gaming. If you are interested in seeing what all the hype is about, I would urge you to check out XSEED Games' official synopsis of the first title in the series below: Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcom’s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel (Sen no Kiseki in Japanese) is the first in the series to tread Erebonian soil and explore the inner political conflicts of this oft-mentioned powerhouse nation in detail. With a standalone story that also delves into the expansive lore that has become synonymous with the series, players can enjoy school life and bond with fellow students to earn new abilities in battle, take advantage of speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed “ARCUS” system, and take part in dramatic events that stand to shift the balance of power between Erebonia’s feuding nobility and commoners. |Nihon Falcom, Falcom, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel, PS4, PlayStation 4, Gaming, Video Games

12296|2017-11-08|16:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/dragon-quest-rivals/| News | Games | 'Dragon Quest Rivals' is a Smash Hit in Japan | With over 7 million downloads in just five days, Square Enix's latest mobile game sensation 'Dragon Quest Rivals' might be the company's biggest release yet. |The mobile game world has been rife with a number of runaway successes recently. Whether it be the news that Sony is likely going to have its most profitable year ever thanks to Fate/Grand Order, or that Nintendo continues to dominate with hits like Fire Emblem Heroes and the upcoming worldwide release of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, it's easy to understand why a platform that mostly everyone uses daily would be the obvious choice for many game companies these days. In all of my time following and playing mobile games, however, not once have a seen anything like the numbers coming from Dragon Quest Rivals, Square Enix's latest release in Japan. The title has achieved 7 million individual downloads in just five days. For comparison's sake, it took Fate/Grand Order a little over two months to reach just 1 million downloads across both the United States and Canada. The game is hot on the heels of Dragon Quest XI, the latest mainline entry in the series for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 3DS. Historically, the franchise has achieved higher sales in Japan than any RPG franchise, including Square Enix's own Final Fantasy series, which has done better numbers in the west as of recent years. Now that anyone who has a smart device has access to a piece of the Dragon Quest hotness, it's easy to see how this insane number of downloads was achieved, even if it is still rather surprising. Dragon Quest Rivals is a card-battler in a similar style to Hearthstone. The addictive draw of the gacha system is also present in full force, allowing players the chance to draw their favorite characters. Take a look at a pair of Japanese trailers for the game below: Square Enix has done a wild job marketing the franchise recently. Even though the games feature a colorful and whimsical style that is instantly appealing to younger players, the company has also produced a number of nostalgia-tinged ads featuring older and visibly busier adult fans popping the games in (so to speak) so that they can have just one more go at saving the world. I think it's safe to say that most anyone in Japan can look at Dragon Quest with a certain degree of fondness, and that has clearly translated into a huge hit for Square Enix. It'll be interesting to see if they can keep a steady growth in the coming months. Dragon Quest Rivals released on November 2 in Japan for both iOS and Android platforms. No release outside of Japan has been announced as of yet, but it was revealed that Dragon Quest XI will be localized for worldwide release next year.|Dragon Quest, Draqon Quest Rivals, Square Enix, mobage, mobile games, Gaming, Video Games, Dragon Quest App

Taking some of horror mangaka extraordinaire Junji Ito's greatest works and adapting them to anime form, "Junji Ito Collection" offers a whole world of promise for fans of his quirky body horror specialties. Turns out now, those fans will be able to check out the series a couple of days earlier -- at least if they're in Japan. Set to premiere January 5, 2017, at 10:30 p.m. on WOWOW, those who simply couldn't wait a couple of extra days will be able to kick the screams off slightly early when both Ito's "Masterpiece Collection" and "Fragments of Horror" classics get the anime treatment. It's worth noting too that the anime will still air on January 7 via Tokyo MX, and that it's yet to be announced if streaming rights have been acquired internationally, though I imagine that won't be far off. Directed by Shinobu Tagashira, perhaps best known for his work on the "Hunter x Hunter" and "Diabolik Lovers" series', and featuring music from "My Hero Academia" composer Yuuki Hayashi, we're already teased with an interesting blend of creatives. We'll see Studio DEEN handling production of the anime, and relative newcomer Kaoru Sawada handling the script. There's no doubt in my mind that we're going to be in for one wild ride when "Junji Ito Collection" premieres on January 5, and I'm beyond excited to see what the staff manage to pull off given the excellent source material.

It was the unifying anthem of our entire generation, one that played a crucial role in just about every in-house karaoke session with friends and loved ones. Well, that very same theme that united us back then has returned -- this time with a fresh face, and here to accompany the latest Pokemon film "Pokemon the Movie: I Choose You!" When news broke that the Japanese version of the film featured a revised version of the original Japanese theme song, fans were left curious as to whether or not they would be seeing a similar treatment in the English release. Well, they can rest assured now, with the booming desire to "be the very best" sounding as good now as ever before. In celebration of the film's release, The Pokemon Company have made a clip of the revisited theme available on their official YouTube channel for streaming. With two of four screening dates already passed in North America, those hoping to catch the film will have to make their way to select theaters on either the 11th or 14th.

12263|2017-11-01|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/satoshi-kon-opus/| News | Anime , Manga | Anime Adaptation of Satoshi Kon's 'Opus' Could Be on the Way | Before the late Satoshi Kon ever got into directing, he had published a manga. Now, that manga may be getting an anime adaptation of its own. |When it came to duos in the world of anime production, perhaps none were as dynamic as Satoshi Kon and Susumu Hirasawa. When Kon needed a sweeping score with just enough electronic sounds and guitar twang mixed in for good measure, Hirasawa was his go-to guy. Of Kon's four feature-length films and single TV series, he produced the music for three: Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Paranoia Agent. Since Kon's passing, Hirasawa has continued to produce the music for many Berserk-related projects, including last year's CG-animated affair. Aside from those bits, however, the artist has remained fairly silent in regards to the late director, his works, and anime in general. That is, until now with a recent Tweet: 私は今敏の作品「OPUS」のテーマ曲を依頼され、制作に取り掛かった、と叫ぶから、止めるなら今だ。 — Susumu Hirasawa (@hirasawa) October 27, 2017 I'm announcing that I've been asked to compose the theme song for Satoshi Kon's 'Opus', and that I have begun work on it. If anyone is to stop this, the time is now. 'Opus' is a manga that Kon both wrote and illustrated from 1995 to 1996, which was more than a year before his major directorial debut with Perfect Blue. It ran for a time in Comic Guys magazine but was unfortunately canceled. Kon was rather upset by this, and the ending the manga received actually reflected this via in-world references. They make sense, but we'll get to the plot of Opus soon. After Kon's passing, his intended ending for the series was found, and it was thankfully published in a re-issued omnibus edition both inside and outside of Japan. The story of Opus is pretty, well, meta. It features a manga artist trying to come up with an ending for one of his series, who also mysteriously finds himself sucked into the world of his manga. While there, he has many bizarre encounters with his own characters and must discover ways to amicably conclude their stories. And as I mentioned before, Kon himself was forced to end his manga early, so what better way to do it than feature that very same artist character scolding Kon in-universe? It's a doozy, and I would definitely recommend searching the books down to see the real ending for yourself. Now, as for Hirasawa's claim that he's working on the theme song -- no person or studio has announced that they are working on an Opus adaptation in any shape or form. Masao Maruyama, a producer who often worked with Kon on the likes of Paprika and Tokyo Godfathers had expressed interest in doing so this past July at Paris' Japan Expo, but it was made very clear by his studio M2 that that was not an official announcement, and that the project had not in fact been green-lit. Have Maruyama and M2 now made good on their desires, or is this to be handled by another party entirely? Perhaps what Hirasawa is referring to actually correlates to none of this speculation? We'll have to wait just a little bit longer to find out for sure.|Satoshi Kon, opus, Susumu Hirazawa
12258|2017-10-30|18:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/bahi-jd-interview/| Interview | Anime , Manga | Interview with ‘Blade Runner 2022’ Animator Bahi JD | We had a chat with Austria-born animator Bahi JD about his work in the Japanese anime industry, and just what lead him on his current path. |When it comes to interviews I’ve been dying to bring to life since the very conception of OTAQUEST, formally exchanging words with rapidly-rising animator Bahi JD was definitely somewhere near the top. There’s not a single day that passes that I don’t learn something new about the Austria-born creative, and having the chance to further develop on everything I had already discovered was something I couldn’t help but desire. If you don’t quite know his name yet, I can only hope that changes soon. With an entire catalogue of work that can be found in series such as “One-Punch Man,” “Space Dandy,” the more recent “Blade Runner Black Out 2022,” and an ever-developing list of different titles, he’s a powerhouse force that won’t be disappearing any time soon. There’s a lot of different reasons to appreciate his work as a creative — from his self-made position in the industry, to his persistence in everything he does, Bahi JD wins us over in every regard. That’s why we’re so excited to bring you this interview with Bahi JD, which can be found in full below: It’s a pleasure to speak to you today Bahi JD, before we get too into things, can you give us a brief introduction? My name is Bahi JD and I’m an animator from Austria who is currently working in the Japanese animation industry. You’ll sometimes see me working in the field of illustration too. Can you tell us a little bit about how you got into animation, as well as the steps you took to break into the Japanese animation industry? I’ve always been fascinated by the world of animation; as early as my school years, I’d constantly be scribbling in my textbooks to create small flipbook-style animations. Perhaps the point where I found myself completely captivated by the world of animation, however, was when I discovered the animators behind some of my favorite titles. Classics such as “Princess Mononoke,” “Akira,” Mamoru Oshii’s “Ghost in the Shell,” “The Iron Giant,” “FLCL,” and a long-list of others had an extremely strong impact on me. The discovery of these animators eventually lead me to an article about an animator called Ryo-Chimo who utilized an unfamiliar tool to me at the time — the digital-drawing tablet. Ryo-Chimo was especially noteworthy due to his online-postings of his works, and his eventual breakthrough into the animation industry. It was after this I decided to pick up my own digital-drawing tablet, and began practicing animation for fun. It was at this time that I also got in contact with other animators through the internet to ask for their advice — animators such as Cindy Yamauchi, Keisuke Kojima, and Majiro are the first to come to mind. I made some gif-animations and sent them to anime producers, but it just wasn’t enough to land me a job. I was undeniably rejected quite a few times. Cindy Yamauchi gave me some particularly good advice on the aspects I would need to improve and further develop. It’s not just about being a good animator, it’s also about having strong and flexible drawing skills. You have to show you can draw anything in any style, and you need to be capable of drawing good layouts, which is perhaps one of the most important aspects. During this time I had no idea what “layouts” were, so I picked up and studied a book called “Studio Ghibli Layout Designs.” I kept working on my portfolio and would send it back and forward with Cindy Yamauchi, who at the time, was working on a new TV series. She showed my works to the director and producer of the company, and eventually I was hired to work on Shinichiro Watanabe’s “Kids on the Slope.” It was at the same time that director Takuya Hosogane approached me to animate for his Vocaloid music video alongside Shingo Yamashita and Ryo-Chimo. In those early days, there was a lot of trial and error involved for me, but the director, producer and animators were very supportive. It was during my learning process that they taught me a lot of different aspects of anime production, and it’s for that I'm very thankful. 『コンクリート・レボルティオ』OP のラフ原画 pic.twitter.com/P6pVgK1yNG — BAHIJD バヒ・JD (@bahijd) 13 October 2015 You mentioned a few before, but what were some of the animated series you grew up on? Was there much of an anime scene in Austria, or did you have to discover it all on your own? When I was a child, I grew up watching various Nippon Animation productions such as “Peter Pan no Bouken” and “Heidi.” Later on in my teenage years, however, I would go on to discover “Akira,” “FLCL,” “Ghost in the Shell,” as well as a number of Studio Ghibli films, all of which influenced me. I also enjoyed the animation within works such as “Gurren Lagann,” “Dennou Coil,” “Cowboy Bebop,” and held “Samurai Champloo” in particularly high regard, especially due to it’s incredible soundtrack by Nujabes and Tsuchie. There was, and still is a strong anime scene in Austria and Germany — TV channels used to broadcast a lot of anime back then. I include Germany as well because a lot of our TV channels were actually the same; even MTV Germany used to broadcast anime. With all that being said, there was still a lot of anime that didn’t make it to the television. Those are the series that I discovered through both my friends and the internet. I think with the internet, there’s even more of an anime scene all over the world now. Jumping forward quite a bit, you most recently worked on the Watanabe Shinichiro-directed “Blade Runner Black Out 2022” anime short. Can you tell us a little bit about your work on that? Being both a fan of “Blade Runner” and Watanabe Shinichiro’s works, I was definitely excited to work on the short. We had an entire meeting at Cygames Pictures where Shinichiro Watanabe showed me the storyboard, and we discussed which scene I’d like to work on. I animated the scene where both Trixie and Iggy are fighting the guards. The scene was split into two parts; the first part was animated by the legendary Hiroyuki Okiura, and the second part was my own work. It was a great pleasure to work with Shinichiro Watanabe and his team. The character designer Shukou Murase is one of my absolute favorite character-designers. The soundtrack by Flying Lotus was also really great, he captured the atmosphere of “Blade Runner” meticulously, all while adding his own touch to it. In your work on the animated project, there’s a mix of fluid motions and dramatic reaction. Can you describe how you went about planning this scene? Shinichiro Watanabe had a rough storyboard for my action scene, though since it was a rough storyboard, I had a lot of room for new ideas. He allowed me to change up both the action and choreography, as long as it followed the continuity of the other cuts and worked well. You’re always able to try new things during layout and show it to the director for approval. The choreography was a real challenge for me, I hadn’t animated any scenes where a single character is pitted against a lot of others before this. I ended up researching a whole bunch of martial arts videos as preparation for the choreography. When characters are fighting, you try not to make your choreography look “choreographed.” Making it look natural, that’s always the main challenge. I wanted the audience to be able to follow the action without issue — when there’s a lot of characters on screen it can become hard to follow during fight scenes. I started very roughly with the drawings, almost like a storyboard while planning the action. Regarding the question about fluid motion and dramatic reaction, to give an example; when Trixie jumps for a kick, I slow down the action to allow time for the motion of the leg to build up energy — in animation, we call this “anticipation.” This way when it snaps super fast, you have the reaction. You can tweak these actions by experimenting with both the “timing” and “spacing” of slow and fast motion. Shinichirō Watanabe's Blade Runner Black Out 2022 is now available on Crunchyroll Watch: https://t.co/jzBClNjAdZ pic.twitter.com/R3Pn4drs2Z — Crunchyroll (@Crunchyroll) 26 September 2017 When working on the “Blade Runner” project, you had some big-name individuals working alongside you. Was there anyone in particular who really impressed you with their talent during the creation of the short? I was honestly impressed by everyone’s work on the short film. Especially the cuts by Hiroyuki Okiura, Shinji Hashimoto, Shinya Ohira, Tatsuyuki Tanaka, and Mitsuo Iso. Every time Hiroyuki Okiura finished a cut, I would ask the producer to let me take a look at it. I’d sit there for an entire hour just staring at each and every frame — his work is absolutely brilliant, and extremely educative. His sense for realism is incredible, and it’s totally his own imagination and skills. He doesn’t use any reference, so when you look at it, you can truly learn the technical work of a master. It was also nice to have Tatsuyuki Tanaka on the project. More recently, Tatsuyuki Tanaka’s mostly been active as a director, illustrator, and character designer. As a fan of his work, I was definitely excited to see his key-animation again. He’s a very strong animator, and also worked on “Akira” when he was only 22 or 23. In a previous interview you conducted, you mentioned you consider Shinya Ohira to be one of the greatest animators. What do you think of his work on “Blade Runner,” and did you get the chance to talk to him? Shinya Ohira is someone with the ability to be both stylistic and realistic at the same time. He has extremely high technical skills, and a great artistic vision. On top of that, he manages to balance those two traits well. His work is emotional, expressive, and dynamic. His scene in “Blade Runner” is a flashback to the past, where I felt he captured the feeling of that “memory” very well with the rough artstyle and animation. I met him one time at Comiket at an animator booth with Yoshimichi Kameda and others. At Comiket, there’s a lot of different animator booths, and you can find sketchbooks, art books, and flipbooks by a number of great animators such as Mitsuo Iso, Shinya Ohira, and Yutaka Nakamura. I recommend checking out the animator booths if you ever go to Comiket, the art books are great. From the very beginning with “Kids on the Slope,” then “Space Dandy,” and now “Blade Runner,” what is it about Shinichiro Watanabe as a director that keeps calling you back? I’m more than happy a great director like him continues to work with me. It’s always a pleasure, and I learn a lot each time I work with him. He also allows me to be very expressive when working on his projects. It’d be fair to say that none of the anime projects you’ve worked on have been “ordinary.” Series such as “One-Punch Man,” and “Ping Pong” immediately spring to mind, but what is it that draws you to these out of the ordinary series’? I’m just a fan of the projects, and of the people who end up working on them. I like to work on projects where I can learn a lot as an animator from the team members. These kinds of projects can be very challenging, so it’s always exciting and interesting. Where do you see the anime industry 10 years from now? That’s a hard question. I’ve not been in the industry for a very long time, but in the time that I have been here, I’ve seen much improvement over the years. I see a good future for the anime industry, and things are improving step by step. Young animators in the industry are very passionate and are improving every single day, so I think there’s going to be a new wave of big-name animators in the future. More generally, the people here work with strong passion and enthusiasm. They love to animate together, and it’s this strong passion for animation amongst these young creators that gives me hope we’re heading towards a promising future. Working as a foreigner in the Japanese animation industry, is there any advice you’d give to others looking at following in your footsteps? Learn the Japanese language, communication is very important. There are English speakers in the anime industry, but they aren’t always going to be there when you need to communicate with everybody. Finally, is there anything you’d like to say to those following your works? Thank you for all of your support, and thanks for appreciating animation! Jumping over numerous hurdles presented by the industry, Bahi JD is a name we’re certain to see for years to come. He’s a creator with clear inspiration, but also someone unafraid of paving his own paths — and we can’t wait to see where he goes next. If you’re interested in checking out more of his works, you can find him on both Twitter and Tumblr where he frequently shares what he’s working on, as well as sharing glimpses into the life of an animator.|Bahi JD, Space Dandy, Kids on the Slope, Blade Runner, One-Punch Man, Japanese Animator Interview
12256|2017-10-30|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/chuunibyou-movie-new-pv/| News | Anime | New PV for 'Chuunibyou' Film Revealed at KyoAni Fan Fes | Kyo Ani Fes was a one-of-a-kind event, and brought with it a tonne of big news bits, the least of which being a new PV for 'Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai! Take On Me!' film. |Kyoto Animation recently held a huge, two weekend-long fan appreciation event that allowed a pretty substantial glimpse at the studio's processes and materials behind some of its biggest shows. Of course, what kind of event would it be without some new announcements and footage of upcoming works? Though everyone is talking about the admittedly gorgeous-looking Violet Evergarden, the bulk of my excitement for the studio's future projects lies with the latest chapter in the story of our favorite middle-school syndrome-inflicted patients. Love, Chunibyou and Other Delusions! Take On Me is a Tatsuya Ishihara-directed work, and is set to open in Japanese theaters on January 6, 2018. You can check out the new trailer below, as well as July's previous story trailer: Taking place a good deal of time after the events of the second season of the TV anime, protagonists Yuta and Rikka have decided to elope together after they receive news that Rikka's sister wants to take her to live in Italy. The scene at the train station gate where Rikka implores Yuta to go on without her is all the assurance I needed to know that the film will be just as ludicrously-amusing as the TV series, due in no small part to Rikka's believing she is a fantasy heroine. As we see them trek through various locations throughout Japan such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Hokkaido, Hyogo, Aomori and even Wakayama, I'm forced to wonder where these kids are getting all this cash. A brand-new key visual was also showcased at the event. The train and plane certainly seem to be quite relevant. Ticket pre-orders begin on November 7, and those who do so will receive a random clear file featuring either an individual character from the movie or key artwork.|Love, Chunibyou, and Other Delusions, Kyoto Animation, trailer, PV, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga shitai!

In both of the games that I was able to sample, I shot things. While playing Super Hot, I shot bullets at mysterious red holographic dudes who were inexplicably out to murder me. In Gal Gun VR, I uh, shot ecstasy at anime schoolgirls who were getting a little too close for comfort. Oh, and I shot pictures too -- pictures that afforded me a glimpse at various artistic and geometric patterns, like various florals, multi-colored stripes, and even polka dots! Guess which one of these experiences was more powerful in convincing me that the VR world was perhaps the better reality to live in? Please be ready to phone-in some help right to my door, dear readers, because what's coming next may likely cause me to forgo basic necessities in exchange for remaining ever-content on my dear Emilia's lap. Though already a smartphone VR experience, Re:Zero –Life in a Different World by VR- is making its way to some seriously souped-up VR headsets by way of an official Steam PC and PS4 release later this year. Developer and publisher Gugenka has decided to split the experience in two, as the game will come in both an Emilia and Rem edition. Prepare for some comfy lap rests and some tasty treats as your girl of choice takes you completely under her wing. And hey, if you don't even want to wait for a release over those familiar platforms, you can head on over to DL Site right now to grab both the Emilia and Rem editions of the game for 2160 yen each or about $20 USD. There is no word yet on an English-language or otherwise release of the game, but I suspect that it won't be a dealbreaker for what is essentially a total immersion product. I must admit that I was a pretty big skeptic at first, but after playing Gal Gun VR just recently and experiencing just how in-your-face and convincingly-real even an anime experience could be, I've decided that it could indeed play a big role in the medium's future.|Re:Zero, EMT, Emilia-tan MAJI Tenshi, ...Rem, Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World, Tappei Nagatsuki, Emilia, Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, VR, Virtual Reality, Gaming, Video Games, Steam, Playstation, PC, rem, Re:Zero VR

This past Spring, I had the incredible opportunity to check out the official Attack on Titan collaboration, complete with titan attack simulations at a ground-breaking 350 meters in the sky. You can check our detailed photo report of that event right here. After their current Holiday event wraps up, however, the Skytree will be receiving another huge makeover; this time playing stage to not only space battles, but also space idols. That's right -- Macross is coming to the Tokyo Skytree, complete with series concert broadcasts at some seriously unbelievable heights. The 'Macross Blue Moon Show Case in Tokyo Skytree' collaboration is just a small part of the series' 35th-anniversary celebration, and will run from January 8 until February 28. You can expect the Tembo deck of the Skytree to be, well, decked out with decals and pop-up stands featuring Macross series characters and props. Flashy concert footage will be streaming throughout the halls and projected on the windows, and of course, the gift shops and cafes will be offering merch and themed food aplenty. If you find yourself in Tokyo early next year, I dare say that there is no better time to check out one of the city's must-see attractions. Aside from the great collaborations, seeing Tokyo from atop the world's tallest broadcast tower is worth the price of admission alone.|Macross, Macross Delta, Collaboration, tokyo, Tokyo Sky Tree, event
12231|2017-10-26|05:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/porter-virtual-self-eon-break/| News | Music , Games | Porter Robinson Shares New Project ‘VIRTUAL SELF’ | Porter Robinson has shared his new project, ‘VIRTUAL SELF,’ which feels like a beautiful throwback to early ‘beatmania’ classics. |Seemingly out of nowhere this morning, electronic producer Porter Robinson detailed his latest project, “VIRTUAL SELF,” going on to share “EON BREAK,” the first release from the new alias. Whilst little is currently known about what’s being planned, it would seem Porter is carefully scattering clues across social media, leaving us all investigating deeper into the mind of the 25 year old musician. It’s no secret that Porter Robinson is a long-time fan of Konami’s vividly-popular “bemani” series of games, and his relationship with the arcade classics shines bright in “EON BREAK.” The hard trance single seems to particularly pull inspiration from early “beatmania” classics, showcased in both the music video and the track itself. What particularly sticks out about this project, however, is it stands as further testament to Porter’s departure into the realm of music he has seemingly always wanted to share. Unafraid of moving forward, it would seem Porter is experimenting with the things he loves, and that’s always a good thing. While it’s unknown what comes next for the project, we can see that the twitter account for the project is only following two accounts, Pathselector and technic-Angel. We’ll be sure to keep you updated on what comes next. |porter robinson, Virtual Self, Eon Break, beatmania, iidx, Speedcore, electronic, rave
12229|2017-10-25|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/anime-industry-earnings/| News | Anime | The Anime Industry Made a Record Amount of Money Last Year | The anime industry made some serious earnings in the last year, but there’s still some areas that need a drastic overhaul. |The Association of Japanese Animations, also known as the AJA, is a group of more than 50 anime industry-related companies that actively seeks to promote the success of anime both at home and abroad. In order to accomplish this goal, the AJA takes part in a number of yearly practices, including hosting the Tokyo International Anime Fair and publishing a yearly report on the state of the industry, which is aptly-titled "Anime Industry Report." The 2017 version of the report has been released, and from it we can glean a number of key insights pertaining to a record amount of money earned by the industry as a whole in 2016. The first major point -- the total market value of the anime industry in 2016 was 2.0009 trillion yen, which is something in the ballpark of 17.5 billion US dollars. That number is actually up a staggering almost 10% from last year, when it was valued at 1.83 trillion yen. The numbers have been on a steady rise since 2014, when the market value was up 10% from 2013; in 2015, it was up 12% from 2014. There are two key factors that have contributed to this growth -- the first has been the continued sale of streaming rights to China, and the second has been the wide success of live events like concerts, stage plays, musicals, and anime-themed cafes. Concerning Chinese anime streaming -- sales of rights to all overseas streaming services were valued at a respectable 34.9 billion yen, which is a significant growth over 2015's 19.5 billion yen. This year, sales to Chinese services like Bilibili accounted for more than half of the increase. The hope is that this number will continue to grow of course, but the report is prudent in pointing out that this growth could, in fact, be part of a bubble; geopolitical relations in East Asia are tense, and many industry-watchers are cautiously awaiting the potential enforcement of a Chinese law from 2006 that prohibits foreign animation from airing during primetime. It is unknown if that would actually affect streaming services, but it's best to be safe rather than sorry. Live events have seen an upward trend in growth, as 2016 saw an eclipse of 2015's record 52.3 billion yen. Interestingly, the proliferation of a few smash-hit films last year, the least of which being Makoto Shinkai's your name., did not have a significant impact on the market's rise. This is simply due to the fact that the industry was already earning record revenues without film as a category. Members of the industry and various concerned fans have been pointing out that even though the industry has been awash with even more cash as of late, those rewards have not been paid back in kind to some of its most important members: the animators. アニメ産業2兆円突破！ってニュースやってたけどアニメーターさんの待遇は変わったのか？と思ってしまう やはりアニメーターさんに直にお布施したい いつもありがとうございます — ぽんた。 (@_ponta_____) October 24, 2017 So, "The Anime Industry has Surpassed 2 Trillion Yen!" is the recent news, but has the treatment of animators changed? I want (some of that money) to go directly to the animators. As always, thank you very much. Let us hope that the reality of record profits and the recent influx of cash from overseas is enough to inspire meaningful change in paying back the people who matter the most in this wonderful shared passion of ours.|industry, industry news, Association of Japanese Animations, Anime Industry, 2016 Earnings, AJA, Anime Industry Earnings

Released via Ujico’s official YouTube channel, the music video has thus far been met with incredible reception from both old and new fans. The music video is absolutely filled to the brim with references to every aspect of the Tokyo-based producers musical career, and even features a brief cameo from Ujico himself. If there was ever a way to visualize Ujico’s music, this would be it, and SpeedoSausage pulled it off flawlessly. Inviting viewers on a departure from the grind of everyday life, “Pixel Galaxy” is a four minute departure into complete and total bliss. If you’re interested in checking out more of Ujico’s work, you can find him on both SoundCloud and YouTube.

It's a service that has -- over the past several years -- bridged the gap between an entire generation of young Japanese pop culture fans and the content that further fuels their passion and hobbies. The very content that is made available on the platform has become a movement that's rapidly spreading across the globe, and standing at the forefront of this movement is Crunchyroll co-founder, Kun Gao. Heading to the San Francisco offices for Crunchyroll, we had the unique opportunity to sit down and have a discussion with platform co-founder Kun Gao. Throughout our conversation, we spoke about the past, present, and future of the streaming platform as it continues to develop as one of the largest anime communities around the globe. In the fourth and final video in our interview series, Kun Gao steps back and shares the rich history of Crunchyroll, summarizing just how the streaming giant came to be, and explaining just what the actual meaning of “Crunchyroll” is. Sharing a brief look inside the San Francisco headquarters, we’re left with the perfect departure for our four part interview series.

12213|2017-10-23|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/animal-crossing-mobile/| News | Games | Nintendo Direct to Detail New 'Animal Crossing' Mobile Game | 'Animal Crossing' is making the leap to smartphones, and we're going to have all the details very soon. |Nintendo has found some pretty immense success in the mobile games market. It was a move that I am convinced was a result of pure peer pressure (the peers, of course, being company investors and analysts) -- "Nintendo simply has to make smartphone games to survive" -- and while I think we all know that they would have likely been pretty OK without having done so, mobile gaming has been making the company some pretty serious side coin. The one-time-purchase behemoth Super Mario Run and daily microtransaction sales juggernaut Fire Emblem Heroes will likely have nothing on whatever Nintendo has cooked-up for their Animal Crossing mobile title, however; the game strives on social interactions and small purchases, which is something I see translating pretty smoothly to the social and mobage experience. The company will hold a fifteen-minute long Nintendo Direct presentation at 12 pm JST on October 25, which works out to being the evening before on October 24 at 11 pm PST in North America. Animal Crossing has long been a favorite video game series of mine, and I am ecstatic to see how Nintendo can continue to evolve this communication simulator on a platform that seems uniquely suited for it. |Games, Video Game, Gaming, Nintendo, Animal Crossing, mobage, Mobile

A new official entry in the 'Shin Megami Tensei' series is coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch. |We knew that a brand-new entry in the venerated Shin Megami Tensei series was coming to Nintendo's immensely-popular Switch console, but who would have guessed that Atlus would go full steam ahead with the next numbered entry in the franchise with such haste? Shin Megami Tensei V is officially coming, and it's looking pretty sick. Check out the reveal trailer below: Modern Tokyo The source of the great abyss is torn asunder A window to the heavens is opened We are seeking a new legend That was pretty grim. It seems that these days, any mention of the Shin Megami Tensei series falls mainly under the umbrella of the massively-popular Persona 5, rather than within the realm of the outwardly bleak and relatively complicated world of turn-based demon fighting RPGs the series found its genesis in. That's understandable, however -- the Persona spinoff series placed the grim task of collecting mythical demons into the hands of a bunch of stylish and (mostly) relatable teens, and turned that burden into a unique form of self-expression. Slickly-produced and full of character, it's no wonder the Persona games have found a wider audience, and that's OK. It remains an undeniable fact however that the audience is still there for a traditional SMT experience, as evidenced by the success of Shin Megami Tensei IV on the Nintendo 3DS. It seems Atlus are content then, in continuing the main series on Nintendo's consoles, and I'm willing to bet that the Switch's popularity won't be dwindling anytime soon, especially in light of this massive announcement. |Shin Megami Tensei 5, Atlus, Nintendo, Switch, Gaming, Video Games, SMT, Shin Megami Tensei
12207|2017-10-23|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/park-recommended-harajuku/| Interview | Anime | Staff of URAHARA’s PARK Share Favorite Fashion Brands | We had a chat with the staff of URAHARA’s own ‘PARK,’ visiting the real-world locale in Harajuku to discuss their favorite fashion brands that everyone should be watching. |When it comes to this season’s anime, there’s perhaps none more eye-catching than the hyper-stylistic Crunchyroll co-produced “URAHARA,” a fashion-forward series that puts a colorful highlight on Tokyo’s clothing capital, Harajuku. Following the not-so-ordinary story of our three main heroines, Rito, Mari, and Kotoko, viewers are thrust into a world of aliens, sweets, and perhaps most importantly, fashion. One thing many viewers may not have realized is that ‘PARK,’ the cheerful bastion of youth in which the three girls work at, actually has a real-world location just off the main street of Harajuku. Perhaps one of my personal favorite stores in all of Tokyo, even well before the anime was announced, ‘PARK Harajuku’ is a curated haven of internet-age clothing all falling under the brand’s tagline “FASHION x OTAKU x CREATION.” The staff of the store, who unfortunately aren’t Rito, Mari or Kotoko, are all veterans of Harajuku in their own rights. Sharing a deeply-ingrained history in the fashion capital, they’ve seen trends come and go, as well as the rise of numerous brands over the years. Such a professional insight isn’t easy to come by, so we reached out to find out what brands they’ve especially got their eye on at the moment. Within this list, you’ll find brands from both Japan and abroad, as well as a few pieces that push the boundaries of fashion to greater places. Without dragging on too long, however, let’s get right into it. This is PARK Harajuku’s must-check fashion brands of 2017: 1. chloma // Website // Twitter // Instagram If you’re not at all familiar with Tokyo-based fashion brand chloma, that absolutely needs to change. It came as little surprise when the team at PARK recommended them, especially given they’re one of the most experimental emerging brands as of right now. From virtual reality/augmented reality collection drops, all the way to collaborative works with Aniplex, there’s not much chloma hasn’t done yet. Every piece of chloma clothing is handmade by their small team of experts using extremely high-quality materials, but as such, comes at a substantial cost. You won’t see everyone walking around Tokyo in chloma clothing just yet, but I can’t wait until the day even more individuals start picking them up both domestically and abroad. 2. OMOCAT // Website // Twitter // Instagram Most definitely one of the better known names on this list, OMOCAT has long stood as one of the most prominent anime-inspired clothing brands. Dominating the convention scene all around North America, and even recently the streets of Harajuku with PARK now stocking their clothing, OMOCAT presents a colorful middleground between fashion and anime. From collaborations with Porter Robinson all the way to Hatsune Miku and Tamagotchi — if you can name it, OMOCAT’s probably done it. You may have also noticed a special ending card from OMOCAT featured in the first episode of URAHARA too! 3. Uchuu Summer // Website // Twitter // Instagram With creative efforts stemming from both South Korea and North America, Uchuu Summer offers an out-of-this-world take on the themes of summer, nostalgia, and the dreaminess space. Flawlessly blending the color-palette of years past with hyper-cute illustrations, there’s absolutely no mistaking their signature flare. We’re definitely expecting to see a lot more attention towards the brand in the near future, and can’t wait to see what they do next. Who knows, maybe someday we’ll be able to just pop into PARK and get some of their pieces ourselves. 4. 50/60 Clothing // Website // Twitter // Instagram For Indonesia-based designer Machine56, the future he envisions is already here, and it’s best presented through his highly-experimental clothing brand 50/60 Clothing. Every single piece is made in tiny batches, and once it’s gone, you’ll probably never see it again. With extreme attention to detail, and a powerful combination of graphic design and clothing, 50/60 is definitely someone to keep your eye on. Within the brands street-ready collections, you’ll find a blend of jackets, helmets, and everything in-between. If you’re going to go all out, you might as well do it right. 5. IKEUCHI PRODUCTS // Website // Twitter // Instagram Hiroto Ikeuchi might not be a househould name just yet, but his otherworldly creations are certainly going to be showing up in your feeds sooner or later. Though his brand IKEUCHI PRODUCTS might not fall under the typical umbrella of ‘fashion,’ the team at PARK were definitely adamant about putting him in, and it’s easy enough to see why. Featured in a number of music videos, including TORIENA’s most recent “MELANCOZMO,” Hiroto Ikeuchi’s mind-blowing creations make for some of the most detailed works of wearable art. Combining both plastic model pieces and working electronics, there’s no denying Hiroto Ikeuchi’s place as a creative genius. 6. PRISMIC // Website // Twitter // Instagram Started in February of 2015, PRISMIC are a gorgeous independant fashion brand that exists within a different reality than our own. Described by designer YUtuKI as both ambiguous and fleeting, words fail to do justice to the subtle beauty offered by PRISMIC. With their Autumn/Winter collection expected to be just around the corner, we truly can’t wait to see what the brand has to offer, and we definitely expect to see even more from them in the near future. — Coming forward with such a diverse range of recommendations, we’re sure PARK could only hope everyone finds a little something for themselves. It’s always exciting discovering new and emerging fashion brands, and those offered within this list are definitely some of the names we’ll be keeping our eyes on in the coming months. With “URAHARA” currently airing across Japan, and streaming online via both Crunchyroll and BiliBili, we’ve been having a whole bunch of fun watching the real-world locales of Harajuku spring to life with a colorful new attitude in the series.

12190|2017-10-20|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/silent-voice-review/| News | Anime | Naoko Yamada’s ‘A Silent Voice’ Film Review | Naoka Yamada’s latest directorial work, ‘A Silent Voice,’ is finally in theaters across North America — and you can catch our full review of the film here. |What do fan-favorite animated works “K-On,” “Tamako Market,” and more recently, “A Silent Voice,” all have in common? Each of them were directed by powerhouse talent Naoko Yamada — one of Kyoto Animation’s best in-house creative minds. The self-described “method” director has time and time again left a powerful impact through her works, and “A Silent Voice” is by no means an exception. The motif of the film is clear, and the delivery exceptional; from start to finish viewers are strapped-in for a heartwrenching rollercoaster. After transferring to her new elementary school, Shoko Nishimiya is often targeted by her fellow classmates for her inability to hear. Leading the unrelenting harassment would be Shoya Ishida, who we find much of the film based around. Discarded as “harmless fun” by his peers, it takes no time at all for the effects of Shoya’s bullying to surface — this would be the beginning of Shoya’s undoing. Following an incident in which the harassment is finally called out, Shoya rapidly loses the trust of those around him, and is rightfully demonized for his actions, thus resulting in the tables turning on him. While early parts of the film follow a much more naive, younger Shoya, most of the film finds itself following his teenage years. By this point in his life, it’s apparent he’s become a much more self-aware individual. Constantly haunted by the actions of his past, however, Shoya struggles with the effects of depression, a disorder which cripples his ability to partake in day-to-day interactions with those around him. Visually manifesting such a personal issue is never an easy task, but that’s where Chief Animation Director and Character Designer Futoshi Nishiya’s veteran flare presents itself, constantly complimenting the story through the creative use of both color and contrast. While Shoya fights to correct the actions of the past, he learns to rediscover the Shoya of the present — even if he nearly destroys himself to achieve this. Building friendship, developing trust, and learning to love oneself — that’s the basic motif of the film. Touching on a number of different themes throughout, “A Silent Voice” is painstakingly crafted with attention to detail. Through the use of sound, color, and lighting, the film carefully delivers a powerful message that will stay with you for a lifetime. What we can expect to see next from Naoko Yamada remains to be seen, but if it lives up to the beauty of “A Silent Voice,” her place in the industry will only further be solidified as a creative. “A Silent Voice” is in theaters across North America now, with screening locations and tickets available to view here.|A Silent Voice, Naoka Yamada, Review, Kyoto Animation, KyoAni, Koe no Katachi

Heck, just earlier this year, they teamed up with the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise in preparation for the live-action movie for some seriously charming goods. I'm happy to report that they're back at it again, but this time in collaboration with massively-popular mobile RPG Fate/Grand Order. Check out some of the goods you'll be able to get your hands on, beginning November 11. Various iconic characters from the mobage have been plastered all over any type of collectible merch you could possibly think of -- pens, badges, phone cases, folders, t-shirts, bags -- you name it, they've got it. You'll be able to purchase the loot at Animate stores across Japan from November 11 until December 17, and at Tokyo Station's Character Street from December 12 through 25. If you aren't able to be in Japan at the time, I definitely suggest keeping an eye on your favorite online retailer. Perks for waiting though? The goods will also be available in early January of next year, at a special collaboration cafe planned for opening in Ikebukuro. I’ll admit that I can’t wait to see what kind of snacks cute Gilgamesh will be baked into. Need a closer look at the character designs?

Seemingly, the show has proved to be popular enough to justify three different projects, seeking to shed further light on the daily life and struggles of secret-esper Shigeo Mob Kageyama. Next year, the beloved franchise will receive a live-action TV drama, a stage play, and a special anime event. Let's start with that TV drama. We've seen a ton of investment from Netflix recently, in both Japanese live-action and anime production. As it would turn out, TV Tokyo is teaming up with the streaming service to produce this live-action adaptation of the esteemed franchise. It will star actor Tatsuomi Hamada as Mob, and will begin airing on the channel's "MokuDora25" time slot in January. There is no word yet on a possible Netflix streaming deal, nor of a release outside of Japan. After you've soaked up Hamada's realistic rendition of the character, why not go see Mob's original voice actor fight it out on stage? In a surprise announcement, Setsuo Ito will reprise his role in a special stage event that will take place at Tokyo's Galaxy Theater from January 6-14. Whether you decide to take part in the aforementioned productions or not, take comfort in knowing that more anime is on the way, and that it is particularly special. Mob Psycho 100 Reigen ~Shirarezaru Kiseki Reinōryokusha~ (The Miraculous Unknown Psychic) is an OVA episode being produced by the exact team that crafted the original anime, and will heavily feature Mob's master Reigen as he crafts his autobiography. Reportedly, this special episode will incorporate some scenes from the original show, but will also include some new bits supposedly from Reigen’s perspective. The special episode will be shown just two times at Chiba Maihama Ampitheater near Tokyo on March 18. There is currently no word on any sort of wider release after the event. So what do you think, Mob fans? Has any of this got you jazzed? Be sure to let us know below! And for those of you who have yet to partake in this absolute trip of a storytelling experience, Funimation has provided a synopsis of the original anime below: Kageyama Shigeo (a.k.a. Mob) is an 8th grader with powerful psychic abilities. Working under his not-so-capable master, Reigen, Mob uses his powers to exorcise evil spirits. But his will to be normal causes him to suppress his powers and feelings until he hits 100 percent — a point where his pent-up emotions are unleased and a darker power takes over. |Mob Psycho 100, OVA, Live-Action, stage play, Setsuo Ito, Bones, one, Netflix
12184|2017-10-19|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/netflix-anime/| News | Anime | Netflix is About to Release a Ton of Original Anime | Netflix has cash, and Netflix is not afraid to spend that cash on some brand-new, original anime content. |Netflix has been making a huge push for original content on their platform, and during a recent call with analysts, the company's Chief Content Officer Ted Serandos outlined an ambitious plan to increase the amount of original programming available on the streaming service dramatically. As it would turn out, anime will be playing a large part in the company's efforts to ensure that at least 50% of their programming is original content by the end of 2018. With an $8 billion investment, Netflix will introduce thirty new anime series and eighty original films to their streaming ecosystem by the end of 2018 alone. Until recently, Netflix had been content with simply licensing anime for streaming outside of Japan. Successful examples of that strategy date back to 2014's Knights of Sidonia and include such fan-favorites as Little Witch Academia, Kakegurui, and Fate/Apocrypha, the latter two having yet to be released. Unlike services such as Crunchyroll which simulcast new shows weekly, Netflix releases their licenses in seasonal chunks, in an effort to encourage binge-watching. That trend certainly shows no signs of decline anytime soon, as Netflix already has a number of high-profile licenses in the ranks for next year in addition to the above-mentioned; the least of which being Kyoto Animation's Violet Evergarden and Maasaki Yuasa's DEVILMAN crybaby. In what could have only served as a precursor to this announcement, we reported in the past of anime like Studio Bones' A.I.C.O -Incarnation-, a show which is funded in part by a chunk of Netflix cash. This is the kind of production we’re all expecting to see more of following this news. Even the recent sensation that was the Ezra Koenig, Production I.G. and Studio Deen co-production Neo Yokio did not strictly follow this framework, as that project saw first saw the light of day and obtained its first stack of cash from Fox's now-defunct Animation Domination programming block. So now that we know that Netflix is serious about either fully-funding or partly-funding their anime releases, thus landing them a spot on said shows' production committees, the possibilities have certainly been widened endlessly. Will this result in individual projects having higher budgets? Will it result in there simply being more anime content? For the answers to those questions and more, we'll just have to wait a little bit longer and see.|Netflix, Neo Yokio, Original, anime, Netflix Anime, 2018, Investment, Fate/Apocrypha, DEVILMAN crybaby

12169|2017-10-18|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/madoka-pachinko/| News | Anime , Manga , Games | Pachinko ‘Madoka Magica’ Offers Exclusive Happy End For Mami | Locked within the confines of a ‘Puella Magi Madoka Magica’-themed pachinko machine exists a happy ending for magical girl Mami Tomoe. |For many fans of anime, it’s common knowledge that there will always be more official material than what is presented to you within the constraints of any given cour — whether that be manga, light novel, or even video game. What many don’t realize, however, is that deep within the confines of any given pachinko parlor here in Japan, you’ll often find an entire world of never-seen anime content that players are tasked with grinding through to unlock. One recent example that particularly exemplifies this is “CR Pachinko Mahou Shoujoi Madoka Magica,” a pachinko title that completely flips the story of “Madoka Magica” around, should you pull off the right combo. Spoilers below: It goes without saying that there’s one scene early on in the “Madoka Magica” animated series that stands out a little more than the rest. It was this very scene that would go on to shape much of the story from then onwards, and it’s this very scene that is completely altered within the pachinko spinoff game. Before we get too into that, check out the video below: すげぇ！マミらないパターン初めて見たわ！！ pic.twitter.com/NsuLAq4v5m — てーおーちゃま (@tmpm10) 12 October 2017 What’s totally different from the original series, just in case you didn’t manage to catch it, is that within the gameplay of this new pachinko title, Mami actually survives, rather than her untimely passing as it was originally set. Fending off Charlotte, it’s unclear just what repurcussions this would bring forward. There does exist numerous other pieces of “Madoka Magica” media in which Mami does survive, or simply doesn’t have the interaction with Charlotte at all; including the spinoff manga series “Madoka Magica: The Different Story,” as well as the third entry into the film series, “Madoka Magica: Rebellion.” With just how recent this pachinko title is, one can only wonder just how many story-altering animated scenes there are. What makes this clip so interesting is the fact that it’s a real animated realization of just how the fight between Mami and Charlotte could have played out. So while I don’t exactly fancy myself playing the pachinko title myself, I’ll certainly be keeping a close eye on just what those who do play it discover. |Madoka Magica, Pachinko, Mami Tomoe, Madoka, Pella Magi, Good end
12171|2017-10-18|00:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/nippon-ichi-new-title/| News | Games | Famitsu Provides Fresh Details on Nippon Ichi's New Game | Nippon Ichi Software's latest game will have you commanding princesses in a brand new RPG title. |Just a few days ago, word came via Nippon Ichi Software's official Twitter account that they were developing a brand-new title, and that the four colors in the announcement graphic were of particular importance. Now, thanks to Famitsu, Japan's biggest gaming news magazine, we have a few more solid details behind the cryptic blue, yellow, green, and red hues in the tweet and on the official teaser site. It would seem that they represent the colors of four unique princesses who will be the basis of the game. Anata no Shikihime Kyodotan, which can be translated as "Your Four Princess Knights Training Story" (something that is likely to be smoothed over for localization) is an RPG debuting for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and perhaps most excitingly in my opinion, the Nintendo Switch. It will feature art by NIS character designer, who most recently worked on The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2, Madoka Hanshiro. As for that training aspect? Well, knowing NIS, I imagine that it'll involve a fair bit of innuendo, but the game's system is described as a "communication" RPG wherein you raise the characters and issue commands to them in battle. You get to praise them for a job well done, or scold them for their failures. I guess it remains to be seen if this goes as far as what we've seen in the past with games like Criminal Girls. The battle system involves issuing commands to your force of soldiers through both the game's protagonist (you, the commander), and the princesses themselves. Details of each of the four princesses backstories have also been provided by the magazine: Veronica (voice: Hiromi Igarashi) - A gifted young witch who is part of a magical guild. Wants to take over the world with fear for her own self-gain. Liliati (voice: Ayane Sakura) - Princess of her kingdom and commander of its knights. She is well-loved by her subjects. Monomaria (voice: Rarisa Tago Takeda) - A princess of Yudaria, who are a fallen noble family of a merchant alliance. Makes a living through her mercenary business. Alpana (voice: Yuka Kuwahara) - Princess of the Dragon God Family. She preaches the word of the 'Great Makara Teachings,' and aims to unify all other families. The game will be released in Japan on January 25, 2018. We'll bring you more as it's revealed, including character art and screenshots, so be sure to stay tuned! |NIS, Nippon Ichi Software, Madoka Hanashiro, Your Four Princess Knights Training Story

Such earnings over the course of a single weekend have gone on to make it the biggest film in Japanese theaters as of right now, topping other currently-screening titles such as “War of the Planet of the Apes,” which released a day prior.

Generally, we can all agree that that's probably a good thing, but sometimes some things get, well, lost in translation. The latest victim of poor word choice and awkward phrasing, presumably due to machine translation and insufficient editing efforts, is NIS America's international release of Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana. Company president and CEO Takuro Yamashita has released an official statement in the form of an apology: To All Customers of Ys VIII, Thank you for all the feedback and support we have received since the launch of Ys VIII. It has come to my attention that the quality of the Ys VIII localization has not reached an acceptable level by our own standards, but most importantly by yours. As president of NIS America, Inc. I want to apologize to you personally for this grave error. This situation should not have happened – especially to a game as wonderful as Ys VIII and by a company that strives to deliver the very best customer experience in each title. We have begun internally to investigate the causes of this situation as well as to implement steps to ensure that a similar situation does not occur again. As for Ys VIII itself, we will have a new translator and editor go over the entire localization to fix grammatical errors, typos, inconsistencies, and also to take a fresh look at the dialog and characterizations. For the script, where necessary, we will re-translate and re-edit the game including updating voicework to reflect these changes. We plan to have this work done by the end of November and will offer the updated localization free of charge for both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions of the game via patch. The Steam version of the game will include this localization in its initial release. We humbly request your patience in this process. Again, as the president and CEO of NIS America, Inc, I deeply apologize and vow to you that we will bring the quality of the localization of Ys VIII up to the high standards that it and you deserve. Please allow us this opportunity to restore your faith in NIS America, Inc. Sincerely, Takuro Yamashita Fans of the Ys series decided to get in touch with the creators -- they started an email campaign to express their disappointment directly to Falcom for the botched effort. The promised delivery of the patch by the end of November is quite a lofty goal -- I'll be particularly proud of the company if they can deliver on that promise, this coming from a frequent translator!|Ys, Ys XIII: Lacrimosa, NIS America, NIS, Nippon Ichi Software, Gaming, Video Games

Many have interpreted it as an attempt by Kadokawa to gain more control of an unexpectedly popular and now lucrative series, but there does seem to be a lot to the controversy that, to be fair, Kadokawa ought to make clear. Aside from a few company execs like Kadokawa Dwango CEO Nobuo Kawakami and Kadokawa president Shinichiro Inoue coming out to say they were "worried" and that they were "looking for a solution," not much has been offered to calm angry fans. Leave that to TATSUKI then, with another simple Tweet: （どうも、とくにご報告はないのですが、irodori３人元気に生きております。気にかけて下さった方、各種お便り下さった方、ありがとうございます。励まされました。何の作品になるかは分かりませんが、かわらずアニメ屋らしくもくもく作ってゆきますー） — たつき／irodori (@irodori7) October 9, 2017 Hello, I don't really have any particular announcement to make, but the 3 members of irodori are alive and well. Thank you to everyone who remained worried about us and reached out. It was encouraging. I don't know what kind of works (we may) produce in the future, but I still intend to create anime. While it doesn't inspire much hope that TATSUKI and co. have received any indication that they may just be added back to the “Kemono Friends” project, at least it goes to show that the guy is a class act -- not even a mention of the drama or of those who have caused both him and fans so much grief. We're looking forward to seeing what you bring into this world next, TATSUKI and members of irodori!

12133|2017-10-11|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/interview-watanabe-shinichiro/| Interview | Anime | Interview with Cowboy Bebop Creator Watanabe Shinichiro | We sat down to chat with one of the most influential creators in the history of anime, Watanabe Shinichiro. |Within the world of Japanese animation, there are few individuals more prolific than Watanabe Shinichiro. This fact has become so prevalent in fact, that the term ‘anime’ has almost become synonymous with a majority of his series — many citing shows such as “Cowboy Bebop,” “Samurai Champloo,” and even his more recent “Space Dandy” as their introduction to the world of Japanese animation. As such, the opportunity for us to spend the evening with such an influential creator wasn’t something to be taken lightly, and over a series of both text and video interviews, we’ll be dwelling deep into the mind of Watanabe Shinichiro. Sitting down with Watanabe, we spoke about his upbringings in the anime industry, as well as looked back at his long-history of creations and ideas. You can find our full text interview below: OTAQUEST: Watanabe Shinichiro, it’s a pleasure to have you here. Kicking things off, you originally found your footing in the industry as an anime producer at ‘Nippon Sunrise.’ Of all the other active studios existent during that time, why was it you chose to work there? Watanabe: I felt like Sunrise was a studio that actively sought to animate original works, rather than adaptations of pre-existing manga series. If I was going to get into the animation industry, I wanted to create my own works rather than adopting someone else’s series. OTAQUEST: Up until you joined Sunrise, were you studying anime production? Watanabe: I self-studied pretty much everything I know about movie production and direction on my own accord. I read plenty of books on both film techniques and technology, where I then learned basics such as the 180-degree rule of camera positioning, frame-right, and frame-left. As for storyboarding, I learned a lot of that after entering the industry by looking at and mimicking the works of others. There was no proper education system to instruct directors in the anime industry at the time. OTAQUEST: During that early period of time, were their any creatives who really caught your attention? Watanabe: Kazuki Akane was kind of a friendly rival of mine — he originally debuted as a director with “The Vision of Escaflowne” at Sunrise in 1996. Even now we occasionally help each other out with projects. OTAQUEST: Were there any anime directors that you derived a lot of inspiration from, or even those from whom you took reference from? ​Watanabe: The director whom I have taken the most personal inspiration from would have to be Masaaki Osumi, who worked on the original “Lupin the Third” TV series. When the series debuted, it had a very adult tone and feel, which wasn’t bringing in the desired ratings, so he was removed from the project. He also assisted in directing the TV series “Moomin,” and it wasn’t until I myself became an adult that I realized he worked on both. Since entering the anime industry, I also found myself influenced by Ryousuke Takahashi, who was a part of Sunrise’s third studio and best known for his work on “Armored Trooper VOTOMS.” I learned from him that I shouldn’t rely solely on my own ability to create — I needed to learn to rely more on my staff and their abilities, all while fostering their skills at the same time. For a job done as a team, especially something like the creation of anime, that is of great importance. OTAQUEST: It was finally time in 1994 for you to take to the stage with your directorial debut on “Macross Plus.” Can you tell us a little bit about why you were selected to helm such a popular series? Watanabe: At that time director Kawamori Shoji was producing a film called “Mime” at Sunrise, and it was because of our shared workspace that we originally became acquainted. Unfortunately, however, that film was shelved, but soon after planning for “Macross Plus” began. He approached me and asked if I’d be up for the task. OTAQUEST: After Kawamori stopped working on “Mime,” his break from the anime industry was an extremely hot topic amongst fans, wasn’t it? Watanabe: It was pretty major news. One of the main reasons I accepted the “Macross Plus” offer was to help him make a comeback. Another reason, though, was that I was an episode director at the time, and I felt that I still wasn’t given the freedom I needed to create something of my own. I wanted to be involved with the creative process of something all the way from the beginning. OTAQUEST: Having done just that, you moved on to work on your very first project you could truly call your own — “Cowboy Bebop.” Can you tell us a little bit about the circumstances that lead to this moment? Watanabe: Masahiko Minami, who is now the president of Studio Bones, was someone I had known for quite some time. He approached me to ask if I had any good ideas for a new project, and after about 2-3 days of deliberating, something I had thrown together over the course of an hour known only as “Bebop” surfaced. Usually, the things that are quickly slapped together become the big hits, rather than the ones you would painstakingly deliberate on. Around the same time, there was a very real buzz on the streets in regards to a “Star Wars” revival which had everyone excited. This piqued the interest of Bandai’s toy division in producing something with spaceships as a central element — they thought both the series and affiliated merchandise would sell well. That’s why the offering of my “Bebop” project was taken. OTAQUEST: At that time it almost felt like robots were a given within the sci-fi genre, but there were few works in the world of anime that delved into the realm of spacecrafts. Because of that, daring to switch was quite a large risk for them, wasn’t it? Watanabe: It definitely was, and they weren’t very happy with the way we ended up portraying the world of “Cowboy Bebop” either. Around the time we were producing the fourth episode, they actually pulled their sponsorship because they didn’t think such a dark and subdued portrayal of spacecrafts would do any favors to their toy sales. We even considered canceling production after that whole drama, but Bandai’s main film production company Bandai Visual swooped-in to save the project. OTAQUEST: Looking back on it, it’s absolutely crazy to think that during the first airing of “Cowboy Bebop” in Japan, only the first 12 of 26 episodes were actually broadcasted. Watanabe: Before the broadcast even began — during the production of the first few episodes, there were a lot of internal stakeholders saying things like “This show is too adult, there’s no way this will work” and “It’s just too pretentious,” as well as other cold things. These very same people began to change their attitudes when the show did manage to grow a following, where they then started saying things like “Oh, I always knew it would sell!” (Laughs) In a sense, it was accepted that things may have changed since the airing of the original “Lupin the Third” series. OTAQUEST: When do you think the way people viewed “Cowboy Bebop” started to change? Watanabe: Hmm, when was it that people’s views started to change? To this day, I really couldn’t tell you why “Cowboy Bebop” gained popularity and began selling; even now I still think it went way over budget. If “Cowboy Bebop” had failed, I guarantee I’d be working at a ramen shop by now. I’d be the type of ramen shop owner to get overly fussy regarding minor details and things like ingredients. (Laughs) Anyway, we’ve spoken a bit about all these moments of misery, so why don’t we talk about something a little more fun? OTAQUEST: Well, usually when the name “Cowboy Bebop” is mentioned, there’s another name that’s brought up alongside it — Yoko Kanno. Can you tell us a little bit about her, and why you appointed her as the series’ composer? Watanabe: I first met Yoko during the days of “Macross Plus,” and at that time it was almost as if she was a total newcomer. That being said, however, I too was still a complete newcomer to the project I was about to face. Taking on the role of director — it felt like we had the whole world in front of us. We were also pretty much the same age, and it was almost like we could be comrades-in-arms, so to speak. I reached out to Yoko for the project, but when I told her the details she actually indicated that she was likely going turn the offer down because she wasn’t a big fan of jazz. If things really did go that way, and she wasn’t involved, then “Tank!” would have never seen the light of day, and “Cowboy Bebop” may never have realized its full potential. (Laughs) OTAQUEST: So you’re saying that even though she wasn’t a passionate fan of the jazz genre, she was able to produce such an amazing soundtrack? Watanabe: As a result of this, however, I feel as though a genuine synergy between both music and video was created. She inspired me to create songs that I didn’t ask for, and I was inspired by her music to make scenes that I originally didn’t even plan. OTAQUEST: Can you elaborate on that last part a little bit? Watanabe: For example, the scene at the end of episode five where Spike falls from the window was inspired by the song “Green Bird,” and was made without having originally been ordered. It’s fair to say “Cowboy Bebop” is full of such occurrences, and that the project’s music budget may have gone well overboard. (Laughs) OTAQUEST: Was that even allowed? Watanabe: Normally that would have raised a lot of red flags, but “Cowboy Bebop” definitely wasn’t an ordinary project. OTAQUEST: I guess “Cowboy Bebop” just had that sort of power, right? Watanabe: It honestly wasn’t just the content of “Cowboy Bebop” that was out of the ordinary — the whole production and the circumstances surrounding it were all pretty non-standard. OTAQUEST: I’d dare suggest that non-standard feeling has almost become a recurring theme in all of your works, with one of the better examples being the more recent “SpaceDandy.” Watanabe: I feel like “Cowboy Bebop” was a project full of content that I wanted to create — it felt as though it was a series full of my own personal color. On the flipside, however, “SpaceDandy” was the bi-product of a more diverse pool of talent and thought. Everyone involved was having a good time piecing together the show in their own little way. For the longest time, I felt as though “SpaceDandy” had a totally different color to mine. Looking back on it now though, I do realize there is a fair amount of my own color too. OTAQUEST: On the topic of that pool of talent; how did you go about choosing such a diverse team of staff for the project? Watanabe: When the time to assemble the staff of “SpaceDandy” arrived, I reached out to absolutely everyone I had ever wanted to work with, regardless of whether we were acquainted or not. The world of anime is quite wide, and it was through this project I met a long list of individuals; both industry veterans and newcomers alike. OTAQUEST: Your most recent animated work, “Blade Runner Black Out 2022,” released just a short while ago. Can you tell us a little bit about it? Watanabe: It was right after the offer came in to work on a “Blade Runner” spinoff that I decided the rewatch the original film. It was through this viewing that I came to remember just how influential it was in my entire career as a creator. During the entire production process, I felt an immense pressure given the enormous expectations that come with the “Blade Runner” title. The schedule was extremely tight too, so that didn’t help. I knew that if I hadn’t taken the job, however, that some other director would come around and mess it up. (Laughs) To put that another way, if it did end up failing, it would be my own personal failure — I didn’t want that pinned on someone else. (Laughs) Even though I mentioned that pressure, however, I was able to convince myself it didn’t really matter in the end. Compared to the original film and Denis Villeneuve’s continuation, my work wasn’t as big a deal. It was after I realized this that I was able to work without hesitation and tell the story I wanted to tell. Though the blackout incident is mentioned in “Blade Runner 2049,” it’s only in conversation, which is where my work was meant to complement the film. Taking that into consideration, I began developing my script while consolidating with members of the “Blade Runner 2049” staff and even ended up going to the set of the film for a meeting. It was there that I was able to examine not just the scenery and set, but also show my work to Denis Villeneuve and the director of photography, Roger Deakins. That was an incredible moment. OTAQUEST: Wrapping things up, as a veteran anime director, are there any issues that you have with the modern anime industry? What do you think will become of the industry going forward? Watanabe: As of late we’re finally seeing the upper-limits of a business model that relies too heavily on consumer video disc sales. I also firmly believe we’re seeing too much similar work within the same genres. Now, however, with the advent of services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, we’re seeing a tremendous change in the way content is delivered. Similarly so, the Japanese animation industry is having to undergo some equally massive changes as well. I feel as though it’s become easier to take greater risks with our projects, and that’s something I think is a great direction for the industry to be heading. On top of that, I’ve also been thinking — hand-drawn animation has a charm that you can’t simply replace. It’s become a global dependency to utilize the power of CG animation, but it’s no longer being done in moderation. I just hope more young people — both in Japan and internationally — can learn to adore the world of hand-drawn animation even more so.

Square Enix, though, has revealed today just how to do it -- make that thing 4K! Star Ocean: The Last Hope 4K and FULL HD Remaster will be released surprisingly soon in Japan -- on November 11. The game will be available for both the PlayStation 4 and PC. Check out the gorgeous trailer below, and of course be sure to crank the resolution up to its highest! If there is one noticeable amount of progress that has been made in computer graphics in recent years, the jump to ultra-high resolutions does seem to make the double-dip worthwhile. The original game was released at a paltry 720p, and the jump to 2160p makes the game oh-so-beautiful. My thoughts on the game itself were mixed, but perhaps a fresh look is in order. I forgot about the meat scene. Look at that fat dripping in ultra HD!|Star Ocean: The Last Hope, Star Ocean, Square Enix, Gaming, Video Games

If you’re anything like me, finding some little way to show your support for your favorite series is something you strive to do. Whether that be a small badge on your bag, or something similar in sense, it can be difficult to share what you love without feeling a little too obnoxious — and that’s where Japanese clothing label earth music&ecology comes in. In a recent announcement from the fashion label, they detailed their latest collaboration with the ever-popular “New Game!!” series, which takes subtle aspects of the series and combines it with everyday fashion. Firstly, we see two pieces based off an original illustration created for the collaboration — or perhaps it was the other way around. A simple stark black and white for Aoba, and a diminished pink for Hifumi. Perhaps you’re looking for something a little bit different, or simply want to show your appreciation of another character in the series. You’ll be able to do just that with your choice of four different colored hoodies, each representing a different “New Game!!” character. You’ll see purple for Aoba, dark red for Hifumi, a signature yellow look for Yun, and a deep sea-green for Hajime. In addition to the clothing made available in the collection, you’ll also be able to get your hands on a few accessories in the collaboration. With your choice of a powerfully-lined shoulder bag, and a set of hair ties featuring each character’s signature style, it’ll be pretty easy to complete a fit within the collection. If you end up making a purchase greater than 10,000 yen, you’ll receive a neat little bonus in the form of a badge. Orders are being taken for just a short period of time at earth music&ecology’s locations in Ikebukuro Sunshine Mall and Osaka’s HEP FIVE shopping center. via Anime!Anime!|New Game!!, earth music&ecology Japan Label, fashion, Collab, Collaboration

It's a service that has -- over the past several years -- bridged the gap between an entire generation of young Japanese pop culture fans and the content that further fuels their passion and hobbies. The very content that is made available on the platform has become a movement that's rapidly spreading across the globe, and standing at the forefront of this movement is Crunchyroll co-founder, Kun Gao. Heading to the San Francisco offices for Crunchyroll, we had the unique opportunity to sit down and have a discussion with platform co-founder Kun Gao. Throughout our conversation, we spoke about the past, present, and future of the streaming platform as it continues to develop as one of the largest anime communities around the globe. In the third of four videos in our interview series, Kun Gao tells us about his vision for Crunchyroll Expo, which took place over the course of 3-days at the end of August, 2017. With the intention of further connecting both the creators and their fans, Kun Gao envisioned a convention that would envelop fans in the world of Crunchyroll and anime. Filmed a bit before the expo originally took place, we now know well and truly that the convention was a success, with a 2018 event already announced.

Whether it be the desire for a delicately handled plate of sushi, or the mouth-watering texture of a nice bowl of ramen, Japan has a diverse flavor palete unlike any other — but there’s one item that stands atop all else. I’m talking of course, about the irresistable Japanese curry rice, and more specifically, the likes of which can only be found at a Curry House CoCo Ichibanya. I make it no secret in my interactions with just about every person I meet that I’m more than partial to CoCo Ichibanya, perhaps better known as CoCoIchi. I can’t tell exactly what it is, but there’s something about the curry served within the confines of their stores that has had me going back since I first came to Japan about four years ago. That’s why I knew I had to make the trip, the holy pilgrimage if you will, to the first ever CoCoIchi location in Nagoya, Japan. Taking the bus on what was planned to be a generously sunny day, I arrived to the rainy climate of Nagoya to be met by fellow OTAQUEST staff member Mike Tamburelli. Upon arrival at the location of the first store, there were a few things that stood out more than anything; firstly, the store was a lot smaller than you might expect, though that didn’t quite bother me. |Curry House, Cocoichi, Coco Ichibanya, Nagoya, Coco, Curry, Museum, First Store, history
12112|2017-10-05|15:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/pop-team-epic-staff/| News | Anime | 'Pop Team Epic' Feels Even Closer to Reality with New Staff | 'Pop Team Epic' is almost here, and now we know a bit more about the minds behind the madness. |January of 2018 is honestly not that far away -- just three months to go until the world unites in watching a "crappy anime" with an unironic degree of tenacity. Bkub Okawa's infamous manga Pop Team Epic has become a viral sensation not only in Japan, where it is known as being an unbashed source of roasts on the broader anime industry, but also overseas where it has caught the attention of the masses most likely due to its crude and surreal nature. When an anime adaptation was announced on April 1 of all days, many understandably assumed it to be yet another joke, but here we are after an equally bizarre delay announcement with a January 2018 airing window. The official website had been updated with more staff credits, so let's dive in to see some of the minds behind the madness. Some up-and-coming talents have been put at the helm of the project -- the show will be directed by duo Jun Aoki and Aoi Umeki. Aoki is part of Space Neko Company, and had previously worked on an animated short called Oshiruko - The Summertime Mischief. Umeki, on the other hand, is from Kamikaze Douga itself, which is the studio producing the animation for Pop Team Epic. Kotaro Sudo is in charge of planning and production, and he has previously worked on such shows as Bodacious Space Pirates and This Art Club has a Problem! Helming the sound effects is Toru Kanegae, who has done sound production on Infinite Stratos and Psycho Pass 2. Rounding off the new staff announcements is Gin, from a group known as "Busted Rose." They have previously done the music for last season's Aho-Girl. And so, with a mix of fresh talent and well-established names, as well as with staff working on previous oddball titles, it's safe to say that our hype for the Pop Team Epic anime has been increased tenfold, if that was even possible! |Pop Team Epic, Bkub Okawa, Jun Aoki, Aoi Umeki
12111|2017-10-05|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/street-fighter-v-arcade-edition/| News | Games | 'Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition' is on the Way | Like clockwork, an updated version of Capcom's biggest fighting game franchise is coming soon. |Seemingly like clockwork, Capcom has announced a huge update to their latest landmark fighter, Street Fighter V, in the form of one of their time-honored "turbo editions." With the fifth game in the series, it would seem Capcom has decided to forgo the "turbo" moniker and switch to "arcade" -- Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition is coming next year on January 16 to both the PlayStation 4 and PC, but probably not to actual arcades, funnily enough. Check out the flashy reveal trailer below, and read on for a look at some of the additions and changes. The update adds a few significant features, most notably a full-fledged arcade mode which was curiously absent from the initial release. "Extra Battle" mode will allow you to complete timed challenges to unlock special costumes and content throughout 2018. Additionally, every single fighter will be getting a second V-trigger, which is seriously going to shake the game up. Capcom states that these additions will significantly alter every character's playstyle, forcing you to possibly even having to relearn your mains. They had a bit more to say on the significance of the update to Street Fighter's 30th anniversary: Prepare yourselves, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition is coming out on January 16, 2018! If you’ve been spectating from the sidelines or are waiting for a reason to join the fight, now is the time! In addition to the highly-requested Arcade Mode, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition contains a bounty of new features you’ll want to check out. Let’s get to it! Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition will feature all 28 characters, including those from Season 1 and 2 – with one more from Season 2 still to be announced. For those yearning for more options, each character will receive a second V-Trigger, which will significantly change their playstyle. You may need to relearn your main or perhaps try another character, which speaks to you in a different way due to their alternate abilities. Stay tuned for more information on each character’s second V-Trigger! As it’s our 30th anniversary year, we wanted to celebrate by making sure Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition contained a plethora of new content. True to its name, Arcade Mode is coming to Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition and will be an experience ripe with nostalgia. Furthermore, we’re adding in Extra Battle Mode, a Gallery, and completely redesigning the UI to amplify the epic quality of this new version. We have much more to share on each of these modes and more content to reveal in the future! From the beginning, we promised that you’ll only need to purchase the original Street Fighter V, which we’re sticking to. All the new gameplay-related content – Arcade Mode, Extra Battle Mode, a second V-Trigger, the Gallery, and more – will be available as part of a free in-game update for current players! Those who don’t currently have Street Fighter V can purchase Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition for $39.99, and it will include everything we mentioned above. I'm very happy that they're sticking to their commitment in only requiring folks to purchase one full copy of the game, no matter how many versions or DLC are to be released. I'd like to leave you now with a video message from the big man himself, executive producer Yoshinori Ono. I really hope that his right arm wasn't hurting after holding mini Blanka up during the almost 5-minute video, while likely having to do a few re-takes. Thanks for all your hard work Producer, and hang in there! |Street Fighter V, Video Games, Gaming, Capcom, Arcade Edition
12106|2017-10-04|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/tokyo-big-sight/| News | Anime , Manga | Comiket Won't be Moving to Make Way For 2020 Tokyo Olympics | The Tokyo Olympics are going to be a big deal, but perhaps not enough to displace Japan's largest comics event of the year. |Comiket -- the final destination; a place that so many Japanese otaku fashion as a kind of mecca for their hobby, yet also a place that few overseas fans can say that they’ve been to. Lines with thousands upon thousands of people are not a thing to be shunned; they're to be embraced. Enduring the possibility of heatstroke while waiting for the doors at Summer Comiket to open, and withstanding the likely frigid temperatures of a late December morning during the wait for Winter Comiket -- these are the battles fought, and to the victors go the spoils. Do you know who else reaps the rewards, aside from the scads of doujinshi fans? Talented artists, and members of the local economy. It definitely behooves the government of Tokyo to keep such a lucrative event in the city. Even though this will be in the face of potentially reduced floor space, on account of planned media facilities for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics occupying Comiket's hallowed halls, Tokyo Big Sight. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike announced plans to hold Summer Comiket in 2020 in, well, Spring. A proposed May 1-5 event timeframe is being floated, and remains to be seen if it will actually be adopted. This seems to be a much better option than any other -- either Tokyo losing the event entirely to another major city like Osaka or Nagoya (Comiket staff actually polled exhibitors on this last year), or it having to be canceled altogether. Very soon after Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 games, Tokyo Big Sight was initially planned to be closed off to any exhibitions from April 2019 to October 2020. That would have been an entire three Comiket sessions. Comiket organizers and other businesses who rely on Tokyo Big Sight were understandably not happy with this plan, and have affected a change of heart to some extent. Now, even as the main halls of the convention center are still planned to undergo renovation and house Olympic media facilities during those times, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working with all parties involved to allow shows to continue. To assist in alleviating any trouble that may be caused by closed halls and renovations, the government plans to build temporary event space near Tokyo Teleport station, a major transportation hub on Odaiba, the man-made island upon which Tokyo Big Sight stands. It remains to be seen if Comiket will take advantage of that planned space. All in all, it makes for an interesting predicament, but it is great to see the government acknowledge the importance of Comiket for Tokyo. Through the economic gain it brings, and even the tourism it inspires, it’s definitely not an event we’d ever want to see lost. We'll keep you updated as further information is released on the situation.

Beginning October 17 through until December 18, the two month event invites customers to get lost in the curry all in the name of winning some seriously insane prizes. Customers who spend over 900 yen in store will have the opportunity to enter their receipt in a lottery that’ll enable them to win one of five collaborative prizes. Breaking down the prize list, we see a legitimately cool blend of fashion, cutlery and other merchandise that blends the two major names in perfect unison: 1. Flight Jacket (Limited to 100 pieces) Set to be made available to an extremely lucky 100 entrants, the original collaborative flight jacket is an absolute eye-catcher. Featuring a striking purple colorway, coupled with an extremely Evangelion-esque piece on the back and fitting patches on the front and side, I think it’s pretty obvious what we’ll be going for. 2. Curry Plate Set (Limited to 100 pieces) Once again available to 100 lucky customers, the Curry Plate set features two incredible illustrated plates contained within an original casing. Based on the dimensions shown, and how often you’ll find me eating at CoCo Ichibanya, it’s pretty safe to say they’ll be about the same size as the plates offered in-store. 3. Mobile Pouch & Battery (Limited to 100 pieces) Starting to notice a trend here? Limited to 100 pieces, the mobile pouch and battery features the same key imagery used for the campaign on the battery, and a camouflage pouch for the battery and phone. Do I want my hands on a portable battery featuring all the rebuild main characters outside a CoCo Ichibanya? Of course. 4. Cushion Blanket (Limited to 100 pieces) Nothing says cozy quite like a warm bowl of CoCo Ichibanya, except maybe a co-branded blanket and pillow combo between both the chain and “Evangelion.” Limited to 100 pieces, the pillow blanket combo is ridiculously cool and definitely something we’ll be keeping our eyes on. 5. 1,000 Yen In-Store Coupon (Limited to 500 pieces) As per usual with collaborative events at Curry House CoCo Ichibanya, the final prize is a 1,000 yen coupon for in-store, limited to 500 pieces. In simpler terms however, that’s pretty much a free bowl of curry. What are your thoughts on the collaboration? Think you’ll be trying your hand at winning one of the five prizes up for grabs?

Working closely with another frequent collaborator, Kiato, we’re whisked away into what would be a long-anticipated music video debut for the young illustrator. Some of you may remember from our discussions.// series when we spoke with Kiato, she specifically stated that the next big thing that she wanted to do would be working on a music video, and that’s where we are today: Unlike previous music videos from Yunomi, he this time opted for an entirely animated clip which left plenty of room for Kiato’s prowess to shine. With Yunomi’s hard-hitting beats, and nicamoq’s high-energy vocals glossed over the visually immersive animation from Kiato, there’s little room for error here. The icing on the cake in my eyes however was that the creative director for the music video was Shinoda Toshitaka, who you would have seen working on previous music videos from Yunomi, as well as a wide-selection of high-profile artists such as Utada Hikaru. Handling the directorial role for the music video was Ukyo Inaba, who has previously done some amazing work for artists such as Amazarashi, and has also worked with Google Play Music in the past. If you’re interested in checking out more of Yunomi’s work, you can find him on both SoundCloud and Twitter. nicamoq (now going by the name fuchanmori externally from her work with Yunomi) can be found on Twitter, and Kiato can also be found on Twitter where she shares all of her illustrations.|kiato, Yunomi, Nicamoq, Music Video, Music, Robotic Girl, tokyo, FUTURE BASS

Feeling like a long-lost friend to whom you're finally re-acquainted, watching the first episode almost made it feel like the two-year absence never took place, leaving me laughing like a fool more times than I can count. If you're not familiar with the "Osomatsu" series, it was originally a 1962 manga series by the name of "Osomatsu-kun," taking place before the current "Osomatsu-san," when the main characters were still kids. In 1966 it received an animated adaptation, though it wasn't until almost 50 years later that it would be given a reboot under the "Osomatsu-san" name. Following the lives of the Matsuno sextuplets, "Osomatsu-san" is a hilarious commentary on various tropes in Japanese society, as well as an often honest critique of the anime industry. For two whole years after it finished airing, not once did it feel like the "Osomatsu-san" craze died down in Japan. Proving a massive hit amongst a wide-variety of audiences, "Osomatsu-san" season two undeniably had a legacy to live up to -- and I'm confident from the first episode it's likely to deliver. Filled to the brim with what feels like a real evolution of the first season's humor, season two undeniably steps up the way the series handles lampooning various aspects of anime culture. Between the hilarious stab at deep-pocketed fans of the series, and even the way merchandise is handled, "Osomatsu-san" is painfully aware of its being, and I loved every moment of that. For both new and old fans alike, the second season is extremely approachable and is something I can't recommend enough. What will be contained within the second episode, especially following the first, is a total mystery -- but we can't wait to check it out. What'd you think of the first episode? Did it live up to your expectations?

Fortunately, the Umaibou, which is being dubbed the "Deluxe Umaibou Nicolastick" will be limited to those who purchase a ticket to go see the film's Japanese theatrical run. While you might be safe from seeing Nicolas Cage's face covering your local conbini shelves, it does go to show the relentless fury that companies like these are willing to release upon us.

12084|2017-10-03|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/sword-art-onljne-new-projects/| News | Anime | Two New 'Sword Art Online' Anime Projects Announced | If you're a Sword Art Online fan, then your next year is about to get interesting. |If there is one light novel series that will likely continue to receive steady anime adaptations in the coming years, it's most definitely going to continue being the immensely popular "Sword Art Online." Reki Kawahara's series of books have sold well over 20 million copies and have received numerous novel-based spinoffs, manga adaptations, and fittingly, video game versions. At Dengeki Bunko Aki no Saiten just recently, Dengeki and parent company ASCII Media Works announced that there is not just one, but two brand-new "Sword Art Online" anime in production. First up, we have "Sword Art Online: Alicization." It's the proper continuation of SAO's main storyline, covering the 'Alicization' arc in volumes 9 through 18 of the light novel series. Unfortunately, aside from the fact that the series' voice actors will return to reprise their roles, not much else has been revealed at the moment. It's looking hot though, so be sure to check out the teaser trailer and abec's usual gorgeous art as the series key visual! Sword Art Online TV anime S3 announcement PV pic.twitter.com/hPku9rbcdT — moetron | pKjd (@pKjd) October 1, 2017 Next up -- here's something cool. Did you know that the author of light novel hit of years past Kino's Journey also wrote SAO fanfiction spinoff novels? It's true, and it already has six volumes. Keiichi Sigsawa launched Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online in 2014, and it follows the story of Karen Kohirumaki in the world of 'Gun Gale Online,' which you probably know as the game that Kirito and co. played in the previous SAO anime's 3rd cour. Her avatar's name is Llenn, and the short character sports a pink getup with adorably huge bunny ears sprouting from her hat. It looks pretty sick, so check it out below.

12040|2017-10-02|19:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/index-s3/| News | Anime | The Leaks Were Real - 'Index' Season 3 Confirmed for 2018 | A brief goof on an 'Animax' program description all but confirmed that a 3rd season of the 'Index' series a week before the official announcment. |It has been almost seven whole years since "A Certain Magical Index" season 2 came to an end. Even with 2013's rather excellent film side story "A Certain Magical Index: The Movie – The Miracle of Endymion," fans have been clamoring for more animated goodness within Kazuma Kamachi's main light novel storyline. At long last, that wish is about to come true. At this year's Dengeki Bunko Aki no Saiten event, the third season was officially revealed to be in production. Key voice actors, like Atsushi Abe (Toma) and Yuka Iguchi (Index) are reprising their roles. It's unknown at this point if studio J.C. Staff will be returning to animate the season. Check out the announcement trailer below, featuring footage from the past Index projects! Surprisingly (or not, depending on how you look at it), we knew something was up even a week or so ago. An upcoming episode of Animax's in-house variety program will be hosting two key people from the Index project, namely, Kohei Kawase, the producer, and Kazuma Miki, an editor and producer on the series in the past. At first glance, it seemed a rather routine and innocuous discussion of the series and its past, but you'd only glean that looking at the episode's description now. For just the briefest of time, the page also sported the following blurb, translated: A Certain Magical Index Season 3's Broadcast Green-Lit! A Certain Magical Index, captivating many fans since season 1 began airing in 2008 and season 2 in 2010. Over six years later, the broadcast of season 3 has been green-lit! About a decade after season 1, what kind of story will turn out? It would indeed seem that a big production secret was leaked much ahead of time, and considering the source, I had no reason to doubt that we'd be hearing something official very soon. As a massive fan of the anime series who got into the expanded world seen in the light novels and Mikoto Misaka's spinoff "A Certain Scientific Railgun," you know I'm psyched. Many are questioning why there was such a long gap between production in a series that has enjoyed very steady sales in the light novel realm, so it will be interesting to see if this will prompt any new fans to join the fold.

There's even a new trailer too. |Try not to be too surprised, but a third season of the massively popular Shonen Jump series "My Hero Academia" has just been announced. Following the massive final episode of the series' second season, TOHO Animation wasted absolutely no time in announcing that the third season was already in the works.

The announcement was shared during Aniplex of America's panel at Anime Weekend Atlanta, where they also made a note of a handful of other series making their way to the free-to-stream platform. Other titles expected to be released include "Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood," "Puella Magi Madoka Magica," "Sword Art Online," "Gurren Lagann" and "Fate/Zero." For those of you groaning at the thought of needing to fork out the money for yet another streaming service, there's a silver lining; Aniplex of America has made it clear that go90 does not require fees to stream content, with the platform aimed at streaming on a tight budget. If you're yet to check out "Anohana," I can't help but recommend it a million times over. If you're anything like me, the only cost you'll find involved here is some tissues for some real tear-jerking moments. It'll be interesting to see what go90 can bring to the table in the coming years. Aniplex of America President Shu Nishimoto had the following words to share in regards to the partnership: “We are very excited to be partnering with go90 – part of Verizon’s digital media network – to provide more opportunities for anime fans to stream their favorite shows. Since anime is a relatively new venture for go90, we hope this partnership will be a perfect opportunity for more people to become anime fans.” If you're interested in checking out the platform, and especially if you're interested in checking out "Anohana," you can begin streaming via the official website, here.|go90, Aniplex, Aniplex of America, God Eater, Anohana, Verizon, Gurren Lagann, Madoka Magica, Sword Art Online

Abrams has today announced that his studio, Bad Robot Productions, would be handling a live-action adaptation of the 2016 box office hit, 'your name.' |When it comes to things that we probably weren't expecting to happen, I'd dare suggest a J.J. Abrams-produced live-action adaptation of Makoto Shinkai's smash-hit "your name." is pretty high on the list. However, this just happens to be the timeline we're living in, and what a weird one it is. Announced earlier, J.J. Abram's studio, Bad Robot, will be handling the production of a Hollywood live-action adaptation of the film, which is set to be distributed by Paramount Pictures and penned by Eric Heisserer of "Arrival" fame. Abrams is perhaps best known for his work on both the "Star Wars" and "Star Trek" reboots of the last several years, as well as a slew of other high-budget films in which he has directed and produced. Sending shockwaves throughout the anime community, the announcement was met with mixed opinions from fans of the original 2016 animated film. Many raised concerns in particular regarding the lack of 'good' live-action adaptations to stem from the Hollywood film industry as of late, following less-than-stellar reviews of both Rupert Sanders' "Ghost in the Shell" adaptation, and Adam Wingard's "Death Note." Others simply suggested the original animated film simply gets another wave of screenings, allowing a larger audience to enjoy it. Instead of making a live action Your Name, couldn't we just, like, bring it back to theaters and tell people about it — Passion Harmony (@PassionTentacle) 28 September 2017 Following the announcement that the adaptation would be coming to fruition, Makoto Shinkai, the original director of the animated film, had the following to say: "your name. is a film created with the innate imaginations of a Japanese team and put together in a domestic medium. When such a work is imbued with Hollywood filmmaking, we may see new possibilities that we had been completely unaware of. I am looking forward to the live-action film with excited anticipation." While the live-action adaptation still does come as a surprise to many, it isn't too farfetched to say it was almost inevitable. With the widespread global success of the film, which in some cases was more than that of other Hollywood movies this year, the industry demanding in on the project should be expected. What are your thoughts on the news of this live-action adaptation? Are you excited to see what could come of it, or do you think it's another unnecessary adaptation of an already incredible film? |Your Name, Kimi no Na Wa, JJ Abrams, Makoto Shinkai, Bad Robot Productions, Eric Heisserer, Live Action, Live-Action

12060|2017-09-27|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/blade-runner-2022-review/| News | Anime | 'Blade Runner Black Out 2022' Review | The creator of 'Cowboy Bebop' returns once more to share yet another animated masterpiece, this time in the form of an animated spinoff of the 'Blade Runner' story. |"Blade Runner 2049" is a mere week away from release in the United States, and roughly a month away from release here in Japan. It's a sequel with a legacy to live up to, and a franchise to uphold. The spacing between the original "Blade Runner" and the upcoming "Blade Runner 2049" is far from short, which left film director Denis Villeneuve with the critical role of bridging a 30-year time gap. To accomplish that, he called on the creative genius of Shinichiro Watanabe to direct an animated short occurring roughly three years after the original film, and set before the upcoming sequel. Titled "Blade Runner Black Out 2022," the animated spinoff is now available for streaming free of charge via Crunchyroll in English, and Sony Japan's YouTube channel in Japanese. Last night I had the unique opportunity to attend the Tokyo premiere event for the animated short, where I would get my first taste of Shinichiro Watanabe's vision of the "Blade Runner" universe. Before the film started, Shinichiro Watanabe would take the stage to share a few of his thoughts on the animated short, as well as its creation process. There was a lot of interesting points discussed, but possibly one of the most intriguing to me was his belief that watching the film with Japanese or English voices will create a very different atmosphere while watching "Blade Runner Black Out 2022." That being said, however, due to regional restrictions, you can only stream the Japanese version inside of Japan, and can only stream the English version from outside of Japan. Go figure. Ever since I initially found out about the work being done on this "Blade Runner" animated short, I've been more than excited. I was counting down the days until its release, which is a rare occurrence for me at any rate. What I'll get out of the way, first of all, is that the experience from start to finish did not disappoint. Between the clarity of the animation, the constant yet consistent changing of styles, and the incredible score from Los Angeles-raised producer Flying Lotus, there was very little room for error. Packed within the confines of this 10-minute animated short was a perfectly paced package that made use of everything at its disposal. Clenching tightly onto my desire for more, Shinichiro Watanabe and his team of creatives have pushed out a finished product that feels polished from all angles. Now I simply wait here and hope that maybe someday we could see this animated world expanded upon, utilizing the very same talent that made this short a reality. If you're interested in checking out the animated short, it's available for streaming free of charge in English on Crunchyroll, and in Japanese via Sony Japan's YouTube channel for those residing in Japan.|Blade Runner, 2022, Black Out, Shinichiro Watanabe, Bahi JD, anime, Spin Off, FLYING LOTUS, Crunchyroll, Sony Japan, Cowboy Bebop

His high-paced bootleg remixes have long been a staple in my playlists, and are the perfect moodsetter for any point in time. I've written at length in the past about his hard-hitting bootleg remix of the "Gurren Lagann" theme, but this time he's opted to direct his attention to something a little more recent. Setting his eyes on one of the anime industries biggest names right now, Zekk completely flips the already hype-inducing "My Hero Academia" theme song into a club-ready banger that'll have you bouncing off the walls, plus ultra. Taking elements from genres like breakcore and hardcore, we're shown a perfect blend between both this bootleg and the original 'Peace Sign' by Kenshi Yonezu. I'm a massive fan of both the series and this bootleg remix, which makes this something I couldn't help but share. We reached out to Zekk to see what he had to say about his latest work, with his comment made available below: The emotions that I base most of my creations off of are both growth and passion. Through growth, we enable ourselves to move forward, but at the same to we need passion to grow. We've always got to believe in ourselves, and believe in our companions who put their faith in us. I want to show such passion through my music. Currently available on both FUNimation and Crunchyroll with subtitled and dubbed options, "My Hero Academia" is not a show to be missed.

It's a service that has -- over the past several years -- bridged the gap between an entire generation of young Japanese pop culture fans and the content that further fuels their passion and hobbies. The very content that is made available on the platform has become a movement that's rapidly spreading across the globe, and standing at the forefront of this movement is Crunchyroll co-founder, Kun Gao. Heading to the San Francisco offices for Crunchyroll, we had the unique opportunity to sit down and have a discussion with platform co-founder Kun Gao. Throughout our conversation, we spoke about the past, present, and future of the streaming platform as it continues to develop as one of the largest anime communities around the globe. In the second of four videos in our interview series, Kun Gao tells us about the trip to Tokyo, Japan that would set Crunchyroll onto a long-lasting path for success in the world of legal streaming services. After facing numerous challenges and trials to make his dreams a reality, Kun Gao would eventually strike the deal of a lifetime with TV Tokyo that helped Crunchyroll grow into the streaming giant they are today. With a focus on both content and community, Crunchyroll now exists as the largest legal platform for enjoying Japanese animated content.

The year is 2017, and such a thing is well within the realm of possibility apparently, as it has happened. You can find Exhibit A below. 突然ですが、けものフレンズのアニメから外れる事になりました。ざっくりカドカワさん方面よりのお達しみたいです。すみません、僕もとても残念です — たつき／irodori (@irodori7) September 25, 2017 "I'm sorry this is so sudden, but it's been decided that I'm to be separated from the 'Kemono Friends' anime. It seems this is a decision coming from Kadokawa. I'm also very disappointed." Shortly after the announcement, there seemed to be an immediate and drastic effect on the company's stock valuation. カドカワ株価が崖になりました pic.twitter.com/ibCn9WI8ux — 絶望を焚べて灰になったリペア (@doujorepair) September 25, 2017 Since then, it appears to have recovered a bit, but many are anticipating what will happen when day trading begins in a few hours. The reaction has been quite incredible. For a show that owes much of its virality to fans of the passionate director and staff, this is quite like a punch in the gut. Of course, since the announcement came at such a late time in the evening, Kadokawa has not released an official statement on the matter. It's tempting to jump the gun in imagining that they want to wrestle some of the creative freedom away from the anime's original staff, giving them the ability to steer the surprisingly successful franchise in their own desired direction. Could there have been a disagreement between Director Tatsuki and the company over how to proceed with the second season? Interestingly, a person further removed from the matter who likely had no major say in Tatsuki's departure has provided some comments -- none other than the president of Kadokawa Dwango, the parent company of Kadokawa. Nobuo Kawakami posted a response to journalist Yo Mikami on friends.nico regarding the incident, stating that he is concerned about it, and that he acknowledges the immense personal effort that Tatsuki poured into the work. He went on to further state that internal discussions were happening, but that the outcome is unclear at this point. And here's another interesting bit -- Kadokawa Dwango is also the parent company of Niwango, which owns and operates Nico Nico Douga. You may know the video platform as the place where Kemono Friends first experienced its viral success. Time may tell all, or the petition to get the beloved director back on staff that already has over 44,000 signatures will convince the company otherwise. If you would like to get involved as well, I recommend checking out the amazingly-coined #NoTatsukiNoTanoshi hashtag on Twitter.

Staff for the second season of the massively popular 'One Punch Man.' |In a sudden update made to the official "One-Punch Man" website, it was today revealed the studio, staff, and cast that would be handling the series' second season. Taking over the series from Studio MADHOUSE will be J.C.STAFF, making this the second show that the animation studio has handed over this year, with the first property being "The Irregular at Magic High School." With a change in studios, also comes a change in faces running the series. Taking over where Shingo Natsume took off, we find Chikara Sakurai (Naruto, Little Busters) helming the directorial role for the second season. Yoshikazu Iwanami (Ghost in the Shell, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt) will also be taking over the role of Soji Hata as sound director for the upcoming season. When it comes to familiar faces, however, we see individuals such as Chikashi Kubota handling character design, Tomohiro Suzuki tackling series composition, and Makoto Miyazaki in charge of music composition. You'll also find much of the main cast returning to handle their original roles in the series. It's visible on all platforms that the announcements have caused somewhat of a divide between fans of the series, with many raising concerns over the overhaul in studio and staff. So while I might not see Natsume Shingo's name glimmering in the credits this season, I'm still excited to see what direction Chikara Sakurai takes the series. Whether or not J.C.STAFF will be able to emulate the Madhouse magic remains to be seen, but it'll be intriguing to see just what they can do. With all this said, however, now might be a better time than ever to check out our exclusive video interview series with "One-Punch Man" season one director Natsume Shingo: Further information on the upcoming season can be found via the "One-Punch Man" official website.

It reaches so far, in fact, that we brought YUC'e all the way out to Los Angeles to perform at Anime Expo's headline musical event, Neon District. Both of the two artists have continued to grow even further since then, including a new set of live shows and musical releases under their belts, but all of that will likely pale in comparison to what they're currently working on. Working side by side, both Yunomi and YUC'e have announced three major projects that the pair of artists are now bringing to fruition. Firstly, we see the launch of the pairs all new label 'Miraicha Records,' which plays on both Yunomi's fixation with tea and YUC'e's obsession with the future through its name. Secondly, both artists have announced that they'll be releasing their debut albums through the above-mentioned 'Miraicha Records.' We'll get more into that later. Finally, is that the two will be throwing a series of launch events for the albums across Japan, with the opening event taking place at Spotify's Japan office space. With this being the debut album from both artists, we can expect to see a roster of both new and returning songs. Within Yunomi's first album, 'Yunomoq,' we see a total of 17 tracks; filled to the brim with some absolute essential classics all featuring collaborator Nicamoq. YUC'e, on the other hand, will be releasing both a standard and limited-edition variant of her 11-track debut album.

12024|2017-09-25|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/your-name-box-office/| News | Anime | 'your name' Made More Money in '17 than Some Hollywood Films | A surprising number of major films this year have made less money at the box office than the anime hit, which actually started playing last year. |What do "The LEGO Batman Movie," "Alien: Covenant," "The Emoji Movie," and "Baby Driver" all have in common? All of them are relatively major Hollywood productions, and all of them have made less money at the box office than "your name.," a Japanese animated film that first debuted in Japanese theaters in September of last year. Box Office Mojo ranks films in order of how much money they have earned in any given year, and not only is Makoto Shinkai's mega-hit beating out some pretty big names, it's also managed to keep afloat within the top 20 highest-grossing films of 2017. For a movie to be eligible for the listing, the film has to have made its domestic American debut within the given year the list represents and "your name." manages to grab a spot due to the date that Funimation released the film in theaters, April 7. So while the domestic revenue of the movie sits at a relatively low $5 million, the international revenue that the body-swapping drama has attained sits at a cool $355.3 million. For comparison's sake, the highest grossing film thus far in 2017 is Disney's live-action version of "The Beauty and the Beast," currently sitting at $1,262,904,415. That's right -- over a billion dollars in gross revenue. Like most films on this list, the bulk of that cash comes from the worldwide market, which has paid over 60% of that cost to see the movie. It just goes to show that while Hollywood may still be overall king of video production, they have the worldwide audience to reckon with when it comes to who they have to please. Soon, productions from across the world, and especially anime, just may creep further and further into that once exclusive top 10 territory.

12031|2017-09-25|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/batman-anime/| News | Anime | 'Kill la Kill' Writer Bringing us a New 'Batman' Anime Film | Chalk another one up for left-field anime announcements -- a new 'Batman' anime is on the way from a bunch of prolific creators. |After the bombshell announcement that Shinichiro Watanabe would be producing his animated spinoff for the "Blade Runner" story, I truly wasn't expecting to be surprised again so soon. With that said, here we are again, and yet another prolific name in the anime industry has announced that they are planning a new anime adaptation of a Western media franchise. You may know Kazuki Nakashima best for his writing work on Studio Trigger's instantly-recognizable hit animated series "Kill la Kill," or even his spectacular script writing for Gainax's "Gurren Lagann." Working alongside director Junpei Mizusaki (opening animation for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series) and character designer Takashi Okazaki (Afro Samurai), the trio are currently slated to produce what is listed only as "Batman Ninja." With a little under two weeks until this year's New York Comic Con, attendees are finally getting their first look at just what they can expect from the convention. One thing that nobody expected, however, was the listing of a new animated film slated for 2018 from Warner Bros. Japan simply titled "Batman Ninja." With little more known than the cast above, fans can only spectate just what the film and its official announcement will entail. The event will take place on October 5 on the main stage 1-D at 12:45 pm local time. In addition to speaking about the project, the three will also be showing footage from the film. We're of course ecstatic to find out more about this adaptation, and how it plays into the bigger picture of anime's increasing foray into Western media for story inspiration. We'll be sure to bring you more information as this story develops.|Batman, Kill la Kill, Kazuki Nakashima, Takashi Okazaki, Junpei Mizusaki, Kamikaze Douga, Batman Ninja, Warner Bros.

12022|2017-09-21|18:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/dragon-ball-cloud/| News | Anime , Manga , Games | Goku's Flying Nimbus Cloud Comes to Life in New Pillow | Goku's Flying Nimbus cloud comes to life alongside Kamehameha Ball in new Dragon Ball merchandise release. |Ever dreamed of flying through the skies on Goku's own Flying Nimbus cloud from "Dragon Ball"? I'm talking of course about the very same magical cloud Goku received for saving Master Roshi's pet turtle, all the way back in the early episodes of "Dragon Ball," which still to this day makes sporadic appearances in even the latest episodes of "Dragon Ball Super." Well, that might just be possible now, at least if you believe hard enough. Thanks to the team at Bandai, you can now get your hands on your very own magical Flying Nimbus... pillow. The adorable life-size Flying Nimbus pillow is the perfect complement to any "Dragon Ball" fan's collection. Designed more for sleeping than it was flying, we're sure that if you do it right, you could probably have a pretty super sleep on this pillow. I mean, just look at how much fun the model who is aiming to sell it is having in the provided photo below: With a total height of 45cm, a width of 40cm and a length of 100cm, this is about as close to scale as you can get. It's even got a somewhat alarming weight of 4kg, which last time I checked, is a little heavier than the average pillow. It'll set you back about 8,000 yen (about $80), and is currently available for pre-order with an expected release frame of March 2018. If you want to check out a little more what the pillow will look like, you can watch the showcase video below: Those wishing to place a pre-order on the item can find it via the official online store. What are your thoughts, would you spend almost $80 on the chance to fly your own (not-so) magical Flying Nimbus cloud? It looks like a whole lot of fun and seems incredibly cozy, so I'm more than down to give it a try.|Dragon Ball, Goku, Flying Nimbus, Pillow, Bandai
12023|2017-09-21|16:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/himouto-s2/| News | Anime | Grab a Cola and Watch the 'Himouto! Umaru-chan R' Preview | Featuring everyone's favorite cola-chugging little sister, a new trailer for 'Himouto! Umaru-chan R' is here! |In a preview video that immediately prompted me to buy a 2-liter bottle of cola from my local convenience store upon watching, Umaru Doma, the one, and only himouto has announced that she's back and ready to... snack? "Himouto! Umaru-chan R" will begin airing on October 8 in Japan and will be available in many areas around the world via popular streaming services. Check out the new promo video below, featuring all of the main characters: Sentai Filmworks describes the first season: To her classmates, Umaru Doma appears to be the perfect girl. She’s beautiful, friendly, and fashionable, earns top grades, and seems to be able to do any task asked of her with ease. She’s even humble and polite! However, if Umaru’s classmates could see her in the privacy of her home, they wouldn’t even recognize her. Once she’s inside the door, the pretty clothes come off, the orange hamster hood goes on, and it’s time to pig-out on snack foods, binge-watch television, and play violent video games! This version of Umaru is everything that the public Umaru isn’t: she whines, rolls on the floor, leaves messes all over the apartment, and makes life miserable for her poor older brother, Taihei. Even the most guarded secrets have a way of being found out, and, as Umaru becomes even more obnoxious and outrageous, her two lives are bound to collide in disastrous fashion in HIMOUTO! UMARU-CHAN! Studio Doga Kobo is returning to animate the second season, and the entire voice staff are reprising their roles. The anime's theme songs are aptly titled, with "Nimensei Uraomote Life! (Two-Sidedness Two-Faced Life!)" set to be sung by voice actress Aimi Tanak, the himouto herself. The ending theme "Umarun Taiso (Umaru Exercise)" will be also be sung by Tanaka, in addition, to Akari Kageyama, Haruka Shiraishi, and Yurina Furukawa, who voice Nana Ebina, Kirie, and Sylphie respectively. In all honesty, this is probably my most anticipated show of the upcoming Fall season. I think that there may be something about Umaru that speaks to me on a deep and spiritual level. It's all vicarious living on my end though, as I, unfortunately, do not live with a perpetually exasperated onii-chan willing to put up with my absurdity. But don't we all wish we did? I think I've figured out the appeal! Look forward to weekly coverage of "Himouto! Umaru-chan R" and other seasonal anime right here in OTAQUEST soon!|Himouto, Himouto!

12006|2017-09-21|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/left-alive/| News | Games | Square Enix's New Mecha Game Comes From the Genre's Greatest | The staff working on 'Left Alive' may be the most capable people left to work on something, ever. |Now here's certainly a franchise revival with a twist. When "Left Alive" was shown during Sony's pre-Tokyo Game Show keynote event, many assumed that it was an original, big-budget, AAA title from the artisans over at Square Enix. As details started to trickle out about the game, it turns out that it is still mostly all of the above, but also a sneaky revitalization of the "Front Mission" series, with some seriously big names involved. Before we get too into that, however, check out the trailer below. You'll find some oddly reminiscent scenes from a sort of Fallout -esque romp, what with the 50s kitsch hotel being destroyed set to faint piano jazz: I'm honestly understating my reaction when I say that when the city came into view and those robots flew by; my jaw hit the floor -- hard. But wait, what were those names flashing across the screen? Shinji Hashimoto? Yoji Shinkawa? Toshifumi Nabeshima? Right there, at that moment, we got our first glimpse at some of the biggest names in video games and mecha coming together. It doesn't take much more than that to know this game is going to be something special. Even if you don't know him by name, you are likely very familiar with Yoji Shinkawa's work. The artist and character designer drew the game's key art from this article's header, and is, of course, responsible for the iconic artwork from the "Metal Gear" series. It features the three protagonists, and it has been revealed that over the process of the mostly single-player game, you'll have the opportunity to control all three of them. Toshifumi Nabeshima joins the project from the "Armored Core" mecha series, which is renowned for its third-person mecha-based action gameplay. In much the same way, "Left Alive" is a third-person action survival game, and you survive by fighting a ton of these robots yourself. He wasn't mentioned in the trailer, but an artist behind some of the most iconic mecha in anime has also joined the team. Fans of "Mobile Suit Gundam 00," "Star Driver," and video games like "Metal Gear Solid 4" and "Xenoblade Chronicles" will be ecstatic to know that Takayuki Yanase will be handling this game's mecha design team. It's all headed up by Shinji Hashimoto, who produced "Front Mission" in the past, and has recently been holding brand manager duties for "Final Fantasy" games at Square Enix. So, we have a survival-action pseudo-spinoff of "Front Mission" on our hands, and it looks gorgeous from the teaser above. All we need now is some gameplay, Square Enix, and I think we're going to have quite the massive game on our hands.|Square Enix, Left Alive, Mecha, Gaming, Video Games, PS4, PlayStation 4
12021|2017-09-21|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/coca-cola-coffee/| Live Discussion | N/A | The Japan-Exclusive 'Coca-Cola Coffee Plus' Rules | The new Japan-exclusive Coca-Cola Coffee rules and I'm terrified of the day it disappears from vending machines across the nation. |Let's get this out of the way real quick -- It's been a very, very long time since I've been a fan of soda. I took a plunge a few months ago when a new housemate moved in and tried the fiber-filled "Coca-Cola Plus" under raving recommendations from them, only to fall flat for an entire day with severe stomach pains. On the other hand, however, there aren't many days a week where you won't find me walking around with either a mug or can of coffee in hand. Then came along the all-new Japan-exclusive "Coca-Cola Coffee Plus," a drink touting to blend the best of both worlds, to which I immediately met with a curious skepticism. Like many others, the idea of both Coca-Cola and Coffee mixed into a single package seemed a little strange to me, and I can't exactly say I was jumping at the thought of trying it. Then again, I did also happen to go on a journey around my town trying to find a vending machine with it in stock that same day, so who am I kidding. If you're hoping to quickly jump over to the nearest convenience store and pick one of these up, you're going to be fresh out of luck. For whatever reason, the 150ml canned beverage is a Coca-Cola vending machine exclusive. Getting straight into it, the taste of "Coca-Cola Coffee Plus" is something so far removed from regular drinks, you won't find a valid comparison anywhere. Beginning with a somewhat familiar bubbly kick, you quickly become acquainted with the overpowering taste of coffee that hangs for a period even after finishing. It'll catch you off-guard at first but rapidly found a unique soft spot within my taste palate. Looking pretty much exactly how you would expect a combination of both Coke and coffee to look, you won't find much surprise there. Where you might find yourself a little surprised however is just how much of a kick this small can packs. With 50% more caffeine than regular Coca-Cola and 50% fewer calories too, you'll hate yourself just a little less for drinking this so often. Unlike its standard Coca-Cola counterpart too, you'll only find yourself spending 130 yen (about $1.15) which is more akin to other similarly sized coffees. It's uncertain just how long we can expect this drink to remain in vending machines, or if it'll ever make its way out of them for that matter. Between the pain of having to find a Coca-Cola branded vending machine every time I want to enjoy the drink, however, I can only hope the consistent sold-out status of the drink is enough of a no-brainer to get it stocked elsewhere, and perhaps even outside of Japan. If you ever get the chance to try the "Coca-Cola Coffee Plus," I really can't recommend it enough. It's an entirely unique experience, which you definitely won't be seeing anywhere else for some time. In conclusion, the "Coca-Cola Coffee Plus" is an incredible drink, and don't let anyone else's opinion stop you from enjoying it. |Coca Cola, Coffee, Japan, Drink, Vending Machine, Coke

They're as stylistic as they are playful, and aren't afraid to push the norm to new levels when it comes to both fashion and colors. That's why this season, in particular, has my interest piqued. Through both their latest collaboration with "Adventure Time," which is recently starting to make waves in Japan following Cartoon Network's Japan-focused expansion, as well as a slew of original pieces, we again find ourselves with an incredible season of clothing from the brand. One of my favorite things about Galaxxxy is, unlike a lot of other brands, their style undeniably blends both legitimate street fashion with the quirkiness of internet-age clothing. This season is no different and is especially exemplified in pieces such as their "FRYING BONE" pullovers, which continue to build on the series that started earlier this year; also shown in the below images is the new Aurora Tulle Skirt from the company: Another recent addition to the Galaxxxy wardrobe, though it's been available for a little longer, is the incredible new set of harnesses, chokers and other accessories adorned with brand characters. Though it's a little obvious the brand isn't the first to jump on the holographic accessory trend, it's still undeniable just how good each piece looks: Finally, we take a look at the incredible new collaborative pieces between both "Adventure Time" and Galaxxxy. Featuring three main items, we're offered three choices of colorway for the Jake & Finn varsity jacket, a super stand-out Princess Bubblegum pullover and a series of boxers. It's not the first time the brand has collaborated with the "Adventure Time" series, and one can only hope we get the opportunity to see even more like this in the future: I'm legitimately excited to see the season's lineup of clothes continue to expand and am especially excited to see where Galaxxxy go next.

Whenever I'm watching company showcases at major industry events like E3 or Tokyo Game Show, I've got this tendency to snooze through the hordes of photo-realistic shooters, yet perk right up whenever I stumble upon some new RPG with a unique art style that just happens to appears on-screen. Then I remember that some very non-traditional (at least until recently) games like "Dangan Ronpa" go on to be best-sellers on Steam and that companies like Nintendo, with an actual shooter like "Splatoon," have been seeing wild amounts of success recently. Perhaps we as fans, and the industry, on the whole, have finally gotten past our extreme glamorizing of the idea that a more visually pleasing experience is instantly better. A game like Vanillaware's newest, "13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim" stands to gain, and I desperately hope it delivers on the hype and goes on to make a splash. Peek the new trailer for the game below, which contains the first official footage we've seen since this time in 2015: George Kamitani and his crew at Vanillaware are in peak form, their penchant for backgrounds and beautiful 2D character animation shining the brightest. The world has a believable tinge of dread, accomplished with subdued colors bathed in an eerie, apocalyptic glow. Every corner of Tokyo is brought to life, whether it be the bustling city streets, the platform of a crowded train stop, or even within the confines of a traditional tatami mat room. And of course, seeing giant mechs rampaging in both a 2D and 2.5D landscape is quite the sight to behold. You'll be able to save the world from certain disaster as a mind-boggling 13 separate playable characters next year, on both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.|Vanillaware, George Kamitani, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, PS4, PlayStation 4, Gaming, Atlus

It's through the pairing of Yuji Ohno's next-level jazz composition, and the flashy heists undergone by Lupin, that the show receives so much of its charm. There's a reason, of course, that the show continues to hold so much significance, even in a modern day setting. But let's jump back some 17 years to the year 2000, back to a time when there was a very particular musical movement taking place. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when it all started happening over the last few years, but there's been somewhat of a niche-revival of the Eurobeat genre of music. |Lupin the Third, Lupin, Eurobeat, remix, Lupin the Euro, Hyper Groove Product

Whether a studio is working on a traditional-length project for TV broadcast, a feature-length film, an opening cutscene for a video game or even a mobile game, or a commercial for a company looking to benefit from anime's popularity -- the workload is immense and the people are honestly few in number. Much has been done in an attempt to alleviate some of the negative trends being brought about by an evolving industry, but this one could be one of the most exciting initiatives yet. The Japanese government, under their "Cool Japan" program, is always looking to further the appeal of Japanese anime the world over, and that's where you may come in. Getting a visa to work in Japan in the anime industry is likely about to get a whole lot easier. Special economic zones -- small areas of a country wherein laws regarding trade, labor practices, and even taxation may be different from the rest of the land. A reform in Japan's policy on these zones may allow for environments where foreign nationals can bypass the usually-strict requirements for getting a visa in certain fields, such as animation and design. Usually, years worth of experience and knowledge are required for these visas, but in the name of economic sustainment and growth, the government has come to realize that previous policies, especially ones found in popular fields like animation, didn't make much sense. Graduates of colleges and vocational schools for animation and design shouldn't be denied visas, and they should be allowed a more robust training program that gives them that laser-focused expertise usually needed for good positions. We have the "Cool Japan Talent Raising Investigation Commission" to thank in considering the changes. They are tasked with speaking to industry leaders and experts to figure out exactly how this evolution should be enacted. This news makes me ecstatic, and I can't wait to see more people with a dream of working in this industry having it be granted.|Anime Industry, industry, Shirobako, Cool Japan, government, visa

I think we can all agree that Dragon Ball FighterZ occupies a special place in the echelons of official DBZ spinoff games. It's being developed by the fighting game masters over at Arc System Works, so you know that so much care and attention to detail will be going into this tag-team styled 2.5D brawler. Just as the first official beta test for the game kicked off, Japanese shonen magazine V Jump revealed a new playable character -- Android 21. The scientist sports brains at least equal to Dr. Gero's, and looks that can kill. Seriously, that glasses and earrings combo? I'm vaporized. The magazine reveals that she has strong ties to the game's main villain, Android 16. The game features an alternative Dragon Ball series scenario, aptly known as a "What If" story. In addition to this bombshell of a reveal, both Yamcha and Tien Shinhan were revealed as playable, which is kind of amazing in its own right. The list of other playable characters so far includes: Goku Vegeta Gohan Frieza Cell Majin Buu Future Trunks Krillin Piccolo Android 16 Android 18 First impressions have started to appear from the initial beta test this past weekend, and they are mostly good. Arc System Works has a lot of fan feedback to go off of now, and I'm confident that they'll be providing the definitive Dragon Ball multiplayer experience. via Siliconera|Dragon Ball Z, Akira Toriyama, Android 21, Dragon Ball FighterZ
11998|2017-09-18|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/claris-unmask/| News | Anime , Games | Anison Duo ClariS Have Unmasked, But You Won't See Photos | The concert-going experience in Japan is a unique and intimate one, and though 'ClariS' may have shown their faces, you likely won't find (official) photo proof of that. |No sooner had we announced that beloved anison duo ClariS was set to perform overseas for the first time, this bombshell materializes -- Clara and Karen took off their masks during their final song at a recent performance in Yokohama, "ClariS 2nd HALL CONCERT." Ever since they started appearing live, the girls have employed various strategies to keep their true identities hidden, ranging from performing behind sheer curtains and wearing ornamental masks. To fans at this event, you can imagine just how big of a deal this must have been. And for those of us who couldn't be in attendance, this is still huge! Despite how much you may search -- high and low over social media for that elusive glimpse, you're not going to find it. Concerts in Japan are a bit of a different experience than what you may be used to in any other country. While filming the experience and uploading pictures to any of many social media services may be a key part of letting friends and family in on just a bit of the fun, the act of recording any sort of media at a concert in Japan is expressly forbidden. If your favorite stars are managed by any sort of huge agency, you can bet that you'll see signs forbidding the use of cameras and cell phones plastered around the event space. Of course, media companies, and especially the artists, have a lot to gain when fans are required to purchase their way into the live experience, but all in all, Japanese concert-goers don't seem to mind too much. After all, the experience for you, in that moment, is uninhibited by hundreds, or even thousands of people holding cell phones with bright screens above their heads, blocking the views you paid good money to see. I would argue though, that there is a palpable, worthwhile, and way less-cynical reason that the practice remains a huge part of the Japanese concert-going experience -- intimacy. Intimacy between the artist and their fans. An experience shared exclusively between the entities -- one that relies so much on the continued emotional and financial support tendered, and another that likely has some deep-seated love for the artistry they've decided to consume. I've recently experienced this firsthand. At a Nagoya stop during a tour for another anison artist, I found myself a little puzzled at the selection of venue and its limited capacity. When Konomi Suzuki appeared on stage and began speaking to the crowd after the first act, she mentioned how happy she was to see the smiling faces of all the fans present with her in the room, including a few traveling with her on every stop of the tour. The smaller venue choices were very much intentional on the part of herself and her staff -- she wanted to be more involved in the experience, and allow her fans to become a bit closer to herself. You can bet I was smiling right back at her, as I felt just how spirited she was in performing on that stage. So in perhaps this same way, we can be happy knowing that huge artists like the girls of ClariS want to share a bit of themselves -- their most carefully hidden and personal features -- with the people who love and adore them most. It just makes that concert-going experience that much more special, doesn't it? In Japan, it's rare I walk away from an event feeling it was anything less than a life-changing experience.

Tracing its roots to a California-based Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter Alpha 2 tournament, EVO has drawn together so many of the absolute best within the fighting game world to compete inside games both new and classic. I mean this quite literally too - what other kind of event could have possibly birthed the likes of Street Fighter champ Daigo "The Beast" Umehara? EVO is truly an international event. Players from more than 44 countries have gathered over the years to throw down, so it was only a matter of time until the organizers decided to take their own brand of hype worldwide. Thinking about it, so many of these games come from the minds, hearts, and souls of Japanese creators, and not to mention the sheer number of Japanese players who attend the event annually. It's only logical that Japan would be the next stepping stone, and we're only a short way away. EVO Japan will be held from January 26-28 2018, and I couldn't be more excited. At last, for planned participants and even spectators, the realization of that hype is now even closer, with the official opening of event registration. Head on over to e-sports tournament registration platform smash.gg to enter your details and get in on the action. You have until December 31 to do this. Days 1 and 2 of the event are absolutely free, while the finals on day 3 in Akiba Square will require a paid ticket. Those will go on sale in late October, and the event urges you to keep an eye out for more official news. The games announced for EVO Japan are: Tekken 7 Guilty Gear Xrd REV2 The King of Fighters XIV BlazBlue: Central Fiction Super Smash Bros. for WiiU Arms Street Fighter V As is EVO tradition, the tournament organizers are adamant in making sure your small side-tournament and community have a strong presence as well. Taken from a translation on the event page: EVO Japan is not only a big tournament, but (is) also focusing on to self-produced events by the communities, as the original EVO does. "Unite the communities", EVO Japan will supports your ideas-- such as side tournaments, side-by-side trainings, and free play -- to make a great time for all fighting game players and fans. As a player, as a exhibitor, as a volunteer staff, and of course as a visitor, everyone is welcome to be part of EVO Japan. How many of you am I going to see come January? Bring your A game, and most importantly of all, don't let yourself be free!

11996|2017-09-18|10:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/bbctb-new-characters/| News | Games | New Characters Announced for 'BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle' | Arc System Works insane crossover fighter is only set to get even more crowded, and the first character reveals since the unveiling are now here! |Ever since its reveal during July's Evo 2017 Championship Series fighting game tournament, not much was known about BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle aside from the fact that it was clearly set on being the wildest fighting game incarnation ever. We've waited a few months now for more details on the tag-team style 2v2 fighter, including specifics on who we could expect to appear in the game. From viewing the trailer, we saw Jin Kisaragi included from the BlazBlue side of the cast, so of course it's fair to expect appearances by other characters from the other three properties, Persona 4, Under Night In-Birth and mind-blowing still, RWBY. Jin is confirmed. Aside from the obvious, the inclusion of both Linne from Under Night In-Birth and Yosuke Hanamura from Persona 4 are welcome additions. Curiously, no additional characters from RWBY were revealed just yet, which makes me wonder if Arc System Works simply doesn't have footage of anyone aside from Ruby Rose in a presentable state yet. I don't think that idea is too far-fetched, considering all of the other characters and sprites are seemingly grabbed (or at least modified ) from previous games. Still, I hope we can look forward to more of these little updates as development progresses and the 2018 release date nears. Heck, the trailer itself even ends with a cryptic "You can't be...?" from Ragna, so we know some big reveal has to be in the works!

11994|2017-09-18|09:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/kors-k-interview/| Interview | Music | Chatting With Kors K About the Future of S2TB | We sat down and had a chat with Kors K ahead of the upcoming S2TB grand finale show alongside the team from HARDCORE TANO*C. |You may remember a few months ago we shared details that all activities from the team at S2TB Recordings would be coming to a staggered halt. With Summer Comiket still on the horizon at that time, we had a final lineup of releases to look forward to. It's upsetting to say, but that time has passed, and tomorrow is set to be the final time we can truly enjoy S2TB Recordings before they simply cease to exist in their current form. It's all set to end with a bang, however, solidifying their place in the record books at the grand finale showcase. Standing proudly alongside the team from HARDCORE TANO*C, we have a whole heap to look forward to at the aptly titled S2TB TANO*C FOREVER. Calling on a global roster of talent, fans are invited one last time to enjoy the label in which Kors K worked so hard to create. Breaking the barriers between a wide variety of electronic genres, S2TB Recordings perfectly carved its own niche within the worldwide music community. Ahead of this final showcase, I spoke with Kors K about the future of S2TB as a label, and where he sees himself in the near future. You can find our discussions below: Can you please tell us a little bit about who you are as a musician? My name is Kors K, and I'm equal parts a music producer, DJ and label owner. Back when I was 16 years old, I was fortunate enough to have won a Beatmania IIDX 3rd Style competition, and it was through that my career was kickstarted. What is S2TB and why was it started? For those who aren't familiar, S2TB actually stands for Subsonic Tribe. I started the label with the intent of it being a place for me to freely release music in an enjoyable manner, without the pressure of third-party requests. I had an extensive list of both video game and major releases before starting the label but believed it felt right to take this step. That's pretty much why I started S2TB. What lead to you deciding to end S2TB, and what do you plan to do in the future? When I first started S2TB, I was having a whole heap of fun with it. But Comiket comes twice a year, and the deadlines rapidly became too much for me to handle. It became a matter of pumping music out for the label just because that was the most important thing, and it almost felt pointless at times to continue in such a way. The reason I started S2TB was an outlet for expression, not another chore that would keep me on edge at all times. That's why I decided to bring an end to the label's activities, to which you can find my full statement here. Right now I'm not sure what I'll be doing in the future, though you can expect to see more of my works in rhythm games. On top of that, look forward to more of my own projects and live shows. I'd also like to live in the United States at some point, if that were possible. How did the annual S2TB TANO*C event get started, and what are some of your plans for the upcoming grand finale show? Back in 2013 and 2014, I hosted the original S2TB Gathering shows, for which I handled pretty much everything. From merchandise to booking, and everything in between, there wasn't much I didn't do for those shows. I very quickly realized it would be impossible for me to continue operating like this, which is when I contacted my good friend REDALiCE about hosting a collaborative party. At this point, HARDCORE TANO*C already had a long history. This meant they were already familiar with the correct way to throw a party, which is exactly what I needed. From this collaboration, we threw the first ever S2TB TANO*C show. This year, however, we're stepping it up to a whole new level. We'll be running limousines for our backers who chose the VVIP rank, and we'll also have fire launchers on the stage. It's going to be a really good time. Have you got any messages for your international fans leading up to this final show? Yeah, I do actually. Over the past year I've had some chances to DJ in a few different countries. Following my announcement that I would be ending activities through S2TB, there was an outpour of support for my decision. It truly feels like so many people understand the pressure that was on me, and I'm eternally grateful for that. My fans are truly good people. Through this support, I feel like I've got so much energy ready to deposit into S2TB TANO*C FOREVER. I've even had fans from all across Asia tell me they'll be coming to our final show. I feel like I need to do all of them right, as well as everyone who has ever supported me and S2TB through this final showcase, and that's just what I plan to do. There's a whole lot to look forward to leading up to this final label showcase, and we're so excited to be a part of it. This may be the grand finale for S2TB as a label, but the legacy it will leave on the Japanese music community is set to last forever. More so than anything else, I feel as though I speak for everyone when I express my undying appreciation towards Kors K as a musician and wish him all the best in his future ventures. We hope to see some of you at S2TB TANO*C FOREVER tomorrow and wish the best of luck to both the team at S2TB and the HARDCORE TANO*C side.|kors k, Konami, Bemani, S2TB, TANO*C, Tanoc, Tano c, Kosuke Saito, Red Alice

The studio behind recent hits like Little Witch Academia, Space Patrol Luluco and Kill la Kill are once again approaching our atmosphere at hyperspeed with DARLING in the FRANXX, and they have a bit more information to share about the futuristic mecha project. Let's take a look at the official trailer below, which was shared on the project's official Twitter account: 【5週連続新CM公開！】 第1弾CMを公開！今回紹介するのはCODE：016「ヒロ」、そしてCODE：002「ゼロツー」！そしてこの2人に関連するフランクス「ストレリチア」！ 新CMぜひチェックしてください！！https://t.co/7U941eel0q #ダリフラ pic.twitter.com/VF76JcZtQn — ダーリン・イン・ザ・フランキス (@DARLI_FRA) September 13, 2017 This time, we've been given our first official look at the series' main characters, Code:016 Hiro and Code:002 Jealousy. They are going to be piloting a mecha in the uncanny form of a female member of their own species, and this "Franxx" is known as Strelizia. The teasing doesn't stop there, of course, since the preview does show the silhouettes of eight other presumably human characters and four other Franxx mechas. Luckily, we can look forward to a new teaser every week, revealing more juicy details about the project and its characters. be sure to follow them on Twitter, and keep an eye on OTAQUEST as well as we continue to bring you more on Atsushi Nishigori's (the IDOLM@STER) latest, and one of our most anticipated projects of the next year!|Darling in the Franxx, Studio TRIGGER, A-1 Pictures, Atsushi Nishigori, Trigger

11987|2017-09-15|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/blade-runner-anime/| Interview | Anime , Music | There's a Blade Runner Anime Coming From Shinichiro Watanabe | There's a Blade Runner anime coming from the creative mind of Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Space Dandy), so we had a quick word with him. |When you think Shinichiro Watanabe, I'm sure there's a plethora of childhood defining moments that come to mind. Between series such as "Cowboy Bebop," "Samurai Champloo," and the more recent "Space Dandy," it really does feel like there's nothing Watanabe can do wrong. His style pulls influence from around the globe, but holds particular attention to the West, all while clearly defining an entire generation of anime. That's why the recent announcement of his directorial role in an upcoming "Blade Runner 2049" spinoff anime feels so right. Titled "Blade Runner Black Out 2022," the animated short exists as a middle-point between both the original 1982 "Blade Runner" film and the upcoming 2017 "Blade Runner 2049". It's been detailed that the story is set to revolve around a large power outage across the West Coast of the United States of America, though little else is known as of right now. Joining Shinichiro Watanabe to work on the animated short will be Shukou Murase as both character designer and animation director, with it being confirmed that BahiJD will be playing a role in animation. It's been detailed that Flying Lotus will be producing the soundtrack for the anime. Of course, with the sheer magnitude of this announcement, we simply had to sit down and speak with Shinichiro Watanabe about just what we can expect from it all. You can find what he had to share about the upcoming "Blade Runner Black Out 2022," which is an excerpt of our full interview series with him, below: At the moment I’m currently working on a spinoff of an American Hollywood movie. It’s a spinoff of Blade Runner. I’ll be directing, and Flying Lotus will be responsible for the music. Please look forward to it. Basically, the project is an animated spinoff in the same vein as The Animatrix. Since we’ve recently finalized the details of the project, time has been short. I’ll be serving as the director, and Murase Shukou will be handling the character designs and animation direction. To tell the truth, I have other projects I’m working on, and I do have to continue my work on them, but being such a big Blade Runner fan myself, it was impossible to turn this down. I’m still working on my own original projects, so please don’t worry about that. There you have it, with the "Blade Runner Black Out 2022" anime just around the corner, we've got a whole bunch to be excited about. "Blade Runner 2049" is set to open in North America on October 6, and in Japan on October 27. Are you excited for the upcoming spinoff animated short? I know we sure are, and can't wait to see what Shinichiro Watanabe brings to the table this time.|Shinichiro Watanabe, Cowboy Bebop, Bahi JD, FLYING LOTUS, Samurai Champloo, Space Dandy, Blade Runner, Black Out 2022
11975|2017-09-14|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nintendo-direct-report/| News | Games | Missed out on the Nintendo Direct? Here's What Was Announced | It was a massive day for Nintendo news, and here's everything you should know about the announcements. |Ah, the Nintendo Direct. It's that special little moment in time that pops up here and there, and almost always entails some form of unit-moving news from the video game company. As usual, today's Nintendo Direct was no exception, with fans enjoying a whole plethora of news from Nintendo and other third-party companies who release on their Nintendo Switch and 3DS/2DS hardware. We like to be thorough here, and for the sake of both brevity and clarity, here's a quick list of everything we feel you cannot be in the dark about. Pokemon Ultra Sun and Pokemon Ultra Moon are progressing nicely -- we've got a slew of new monsters and outfits set to be included, and they'll all be released on the 3DS on November 17. A Pokeball-themed New Nintendo 2DS model is incoming, and it's got us seriously excited. You can expect to pick up your own on November 3, 2017. An enhanced version of the Game Boy Advance classic Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga is due out on the 3DS on October 6. You can play as Bowser's minions in a new side story this time around too. Kirby: Battle Royale is an amalgamation of all of those great multiplayer Kirby minigames you've grown to love, and you can play both online and off with friends. Make sure to vote in Nintendo's official Kirby 25th Anniversary copy ability poll too, found here! Enhanced versions of Yo-Kai Watch 2 are on the way, with Psychic Specters coming Sepetember 29. For more Yo-Kai action, be sure to check out the trailer below: Can you believe the Professor Layton series has already had 7 main games? Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaire's Conspiracy launches October 6 for the 3DS. The 2D Metroid adventure we've all been waiting for is finally here. Metroid: Samus Returns launches on the 3DS on September 15, AKA today. Quad announcement from RPG factory Atlus! Alliance Alive, Etrian Odyssey V, Shin Megami Tensei Strange Journey Redux, and Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology are all coming West. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 received a huge info dump, and I can't recommend watching the game's in-depth explanation trailer enough if you are interested in the inner workings of the game's systems. Ah of course, how could I forget until now. LYN IS COMING TO FIRE EMBLEM WARRIORS. I'm obviously pretty excited, and can't wait to check it out. A new MOBA from Tencent is heading to the Switch, and it's called Arena of Valor. It's going to feature some pretty familiar faces, so if MOBAs are your thing, it's definitely worth checking out. As they are porting The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim to the Switch, so too are Bethesda bringing over booth DOOM and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. Bethesda sure do know how to flex the capability of the Switch, huh? Classic Nintendo arcade hits Mario Bros., Vs. Super Mario Bros., Vs. Balloon Fight, Vs. Ice Climber, Vs. Pinball, and Vs. Clu Clu Land are receiving Switch releases. Octopath Traveler is a gorgeous 2.5D RPG from the Bravely Default team at Square Enix. "Octopath" has to do with the fact that there are 8 characters to play as, and is not, in fact, tangentially related to Splatoon or something like that. Expect more in-depth impressions on this one soon! Kirby Star Allies is the name of the sublime-looking new game announced back at E3 for the Switch. If you're gearing for some more Kirby action, with up to four of your closest friends, then this might be the game for you. Super Mario Odyssey is just a little more than a month away, and I'm still predicting it to be an incredible experience from start to finish, especially if this new trailer is anything to go by. I'd dare suggest that pure gaming bliss has a name, and that name is Nintendo. |Nintendo, Switch, Video Games, Bethesda, Gaming, Mario, Zelda, Skyrim, Doom, Kirby
11978|2017-09-14|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/universal-studios-cool-japan/| News | Anime , Games | Experience the Pillars of 'Cool Japan' at Universal Studios | Universal Studios in Osaka looks like it is the place to be for experiencing fantastical other worlds based off of our favorite franchises. |Universal Studios Japan is already home to some of the country's biggest pop-culture attractions. Rides and amusements in the form of Yokai Watch, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, Gintama, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure already exist, and there is a promise of a whole section of the park dedicated to the whimsical lands of Nintendo in the works. That selection is about to get a bit larger now, as attractions based on some of Japan's biggest properties are set to open early next year. The Japanese Government's official initiative to promote Japanese pop culture known as "Cool Japan" is partnering with the theme park once more, and plans to offer attractions based on the Sailor Moon, Monster Hunter, Detective Conan, and Final Fantasy franchises from January 19 of next year. It remains to be seen in exactly what way the properties will be represented, but in past installations of the near-annual event, attractions have included immersive 4D shows and fun games that involve a lot of players interacting with props and weapons. Since the installation is meant to be temporary -- lasting until June 24, 2018 -- it is unlikely that the attractions will consist of things like large rides, unlike the plans for the large-scale Nintendo area planned for opening in time for Tokyo's 2020 Olympics.

11977|2017-09-14|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/phantasy-star-switch/| News | Games | Phantasy Star 2 Is Coming to Switch, Except It's Not for You | A hugely-requested game is skipping out on a release outside of Japan on the Nintendo Switch, at least for now. |The cries of the Japanese game fans echo far and wide. They bounce repeatedly off the ears of like-minded devotees, and occasionally everyone will ring in on a sense of agreement via Twitter retweets and Facebook likes, but alas, these pleas don't always result in benevolent action from our game publishing overlords. When it comes to Japanese games yet unreleased in overseas locales, what comes to mind? Is it Mother 3? Is it the elusive PS3 version of Tales of Vesperia? And how about the much sought-after PSP versions of Valkyria Chronicles 2 & 3? In my mind, there is one experience that seems like it could be so close, yet blows to the soul like this confirm that it is all too far away: Phantasy Star Online 2. Released on PC in 2012, many assumed a Western release was not too far off, considering the relative popularity of previous games in the series, as well as the releases of other MMORPG outings like Final Fantasy XIV. But alas, this day, another platform supporting the game has been announced, yet it alludes us non-Japanese folk. SEGA announced Phantasy Star Online 2 for the Nintendo Switch, during the most recent Nintendo Direct for Japanese audiences, due out in 2018. This version specifically is known as Phantasy Star Online 2: Cloud, since the game runs entirely on SEGA's servers, requiring minimal file size and storage on your Nintendo Switch console. Phantasy Star Online 2 is an action gameplay-based massively multiplayer online game. It's free to play and only requires real cash if you plan to buy in-game items and enhancements. It has received high praise due to its fantastic futuristic world, attractive character designs, and incredible community. Even worse about all this teasing is that the game actually has been planned for a Western release. At Penny Arcade Expo in 2013, SEGA mentioned that there were plans to bring the game to players outside of Japan and the lucky folks in Southeast Asia. I mean, there's already an English translation released in that regard, but there is no official North American nor European release or host of servers. Again, so close, yet so far away!|Phantasy Star Online, Nintendo Switch, Gaming, Video Games, PSO2, Sega, Switch, Nintendo
11951|2017-09-13|16:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/pokemon-card-station/| News | Games | Tokyo is Getting its Very Own Exclusive 'Pokémon' TCG Arena | Avid 'Pokémon' trading card game players will soon have an exclusive place in Tokyo to call home. |Scattered all around Japan, the official Pokémon stores, known as "Pokémon Centers," are some of the slickest retails spaces that pop to mind. Sleek and fun, they are very much reminiscent of the actual Pokécenters from the games. The interiors are typically white and are composed of lots and lots of tiling. If you enjoy Pokémon, they are an absolute joy to shop at, and I know that I've walked out of these stores with multiple huge plushies at some point. Of course, the Pokémon Trading Card Game is still a huge chunk of The Pokémon Company's business, and what better way to attract even more customers to the highly-addictive card battling experience than a shiny new place to give it a shot? Opening at the Tokyo Bay Center in just two days on September 16, the Pokémon Card Station will give customers a place to meet and battle new friends, as well as a dedicated store to purchase new cards from, naturally. Check out the gallery below for some excellent concepts for the new space: It has been indicated that the Station will play host to many of the special events that the administrators of the card game plan to hold in the future. Finally, if you are a beginner player, then a personal concierge will be available at all times during business hours to answer any questions that players old and new alike may have. It seems that with this move, The Pokémon Company has indicated that they don't intend to let the official trading card game fall by the wayside anytime soon. With the recent release of Sun and Moon, and the upcoming releases of Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, as well as a brand-new Nintendo Switch flagship game, the franchise shows no signs of slowing nor any falling out of favor with the younger generation today. It's certainly an exciting time to be a fan, whether you indulge in the video games, the card game, or even both!

11952|2017-09-13|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/claris-singapore/| News | Anime , Music | Anison Duo Claris Set to Perform Overseas for 1st Time | At long last the mysterious duo, producers of some of the most memorable anime theme songs in recent memory, are set to perform outside of Japan. |When speaking of anime theme songs, or "anison" as they are known with that Japanese language shortcut flavor, there may be no other group as prominent as ClariS in recent years. Singing the instantly-recognizable themes of such hit anime like Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Nisekoi, Oreimo, the Monogatari series and even recently with Eromanga Sensei, the duo has become quite the household name. Over the years the girls have appeared and sung at live performances, but have always made a point to ensure the audience remains unaware of the girls' actual appearances, often opting to perform behind curtains as silhouettes. I don't see that trend changing anytime soon, even as they are now moving on to their first overseas performance. This year at Anime Festival Asia in Singapore, the anison duo extraordinaire will put on their first show outside of Japan. You'll be sure to want to be there in late November to catch the historic event, where they will likely sing recent hits like Hitorigoto (Eromanga Sensei) and Shiori. AFA themselves have an exhaustive history of ClariS up on their site, an excerpt of which can be found below. ClariS is a girl duo of Clara and Karen. ClariS was first featured in 2010 when the duo consisted of Clara and then-member Alice, in an issue of anime music magazine LisAni! in a special coverage and on its attached CD. The coverage caught the eye of the producer of TV anime Oreimo (Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai), who went on to handpick the rookie to take on its opening theme. On October 20, 2010, they changed their unit name to ClariS and made their major debut with single “irony”, the opening theme of the anime. The song debuted at #7 on the Oricon chart. On November 8, 2014, it was announced in Vol. 19 of LisAni! magazine that ClariS would make a new step forward with new member Karen. The renewed ClariS released their first single “border” on January 7, 2015. The song had been used as the closing theme of TV anime Tsukimonogatari aired on December 31, 2014. ClariS’ upcoming release is their 18th single entitled “SHIORI”, scheduled to hit stores on September 13. On September 16, they will perform a concert entitled “ClariS 2nd HALL CONCERT in Pacifico Yokohama National Convention Hall ~Sayonara no Saki e… Hajimari no Melody”. ClariS’ string of success is unstoppable! The unit name ClariS refers to a Latin word meaning “bright”, “clean”, “glorious”, etc. ClariS: Official Site|ClariS, anison, singapore, AFA, Anime Festival Asia, Oreimo, Madoka Magica, Eromanga Sensei, Nisekoi, Bakemonogatari

It'll be available both physically and digitally, and you'll be able to get your hands on it beginning December 12, 2017, in both North America and Europe. The announcement is super cool news, and while I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say I'm beyond excited, I can't help but question the lack of Nintendo Switch support. For one of the hottest consoles available on the market at the moment, as well as one of the most fitting for the title, it seems an odd miss in my opinion. Moving on from that, we're once again offered the same stylistic adventure we came to know and love within the Okami series. Players who have access to a PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One X or a high-end PC will be able to take advantage of the games all new 4k textures.

11884|2017-09-13|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/eureka-seven-references/| News | Anime , Music | 'Eureka Seven' is Full of References to Underground Culture | 'Eureka Seven' is filled to the brim with references to underground and electronic music culture, and it deserves to be known. |There's a whole list of reasons why the staff at OTAQUEST love Eureka Seven so much, and I'm not just saying that because our co-founder Dai Sato quite literally wrote the story. It's a carefully constructed tribute not just to the illustrious giant robot genre of anime we all know and enjoy, but it's also an incredible tribute to the counterculture movements of its time. This list includes various elements of electronic/club music culture, as well as throwbacks to a long-list of influential musicians and artists that would define an entire movement. It's no secret that Dai Sato, as well as other staff on the series, are clear fans of electronic music. Between the fact that for a period, Dai Sato owned and operated his electronic label, all the way to more prominent notes such as the use of Hardfloor's music in the series' latest film, "Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution," it's been a well-documented fact within the series. With "Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution" just around the corner, however, it's important that we're all aware as to just what we're getting into in the film. From character names all the way to episode titles, let's take a look at some of the best secrets in the world of Eureka Seven: Character References: Renton Thurston: Pulling his name from two different people, Renton Thurston's name contains references to both Mark Renton, a fictional character from the Trainspotting film series and Thurston Moore from early-80s rock band Sonic Youth. It was by combining the two's names that we would end up with the name Renton Thurston for our series' main character. Adroc Thurston: Slightly more straightforward than Renton, Adroc Thurston pulls his first name from Beastie Boys member Ad-Rock. The hip-hop musician apparently struck enough of a chord with the series staff, finding his reference to the fabled legend of the Eureka Seven story. Charles & Ray Beams: For such a stylish couple, it comes as absolutely no surprise that their namesakes would be equally well-styled. The caretakers of young Renton, Charles and Ray Beams pull their names from the legendary design-duo, Charles and Ray Eames. Once you've seen it, there's absolutely no mistaking this reference, and it's easy enough to see why. Diane Thurston: If you ever thought to yourself "Wow, the Thurston family sure do share a few names with the Trainspotting film," I can't blame you. In the case of Diane Thurston, the older sister of Renton Thurston, she looks towards Diane of Trainspotting for her name. Somewhat weird though to have Renton be the brother of Diane, especially given where their names originated. Tiptory: Acting as the mentor of both Eureka and Renton, Tiptory receives her name from famed science fiction novelist James Tiptree Jr., the pseudonym of Alice Sheldon. It's a little-known fact, but James Tiptree Jr. just happens to be Dai Sato's favorite science fiction author, so it comes as little surprise that he'd throw a reference in about her. Nirvash: This one likely comes as little surprise, but the Nirvash within the series was named after 90's American grunge/alt-rock band Nirvana. It'd be fair to say that a lot of the anti-establishment themes of the band can quite easily be seen within certain aspects of the show, making it the perfect fit for the Nirvash. Terminus typeR808 & Terminus typeR909: For electronic music and club fanatics, this is where you'll start feeling a little more familiarized. Both the typeR808 and typeR909 get their names from Roland's most iconic drum machines to date, the TR-808, and TR-909. The kick drum and snare found within the TR-909, in particular, is found a whole bunch within the electronic soundtrack of Eureka Seven. ​ Terminus typeB303 "Devilfish" & SL-1200 MkII Gekko: Continuing along with the club-centric theme, the typeB303 "Devilfish" stems its name from the custom modification unit TB-303 Devil Fish that would primarily go on to define the acid music movement and techno scene. The Devil Fish modification, in particular, expanded the acid sounds and distortion capabilities of the TB-303. Following this was the SL-1200 MkII Gekko, which was the Gekkostate ship throughout the anime. It received its name from the legendary Technics SL-1200MkII turntable in which essentially every DJ used in the day. KLF Monsuno type MS10/MS20: The Kraft Light Fighter, perhaps better known within Eureka Seven as the KLFs, have quite a few references crammed inside their ranks. Firstly, the name KLF is a callback to the legendary electronic rave duo KLF from the 90s. The duo most infamously went down in the record books when they filmed themselves burning almost their entire career earnings in the remote isles of Scotland. Secondly, we look at both the MS10 and MS20 KLF units which receive their names from the Korg MS-10 and MS-20 synthesizers. Episode Titles: If you weren't aware, every episode of Eureka Seven contains a reference to various bands and songs in their titles. From Western musicians such as Oasis and Beastie Boys, all the way to Japanese artists such as Cornelius, we've gone ahead and picked some of our favorite title-song references. Episode 1: New Order - Blue Monday Episode 12: Hardfloor - Acperience 1 Episode 18: Beastie Boys - III Communication Episode 21: Nuyorican Soul - Runaway Episode 26: Oasis - Morning Glory Episode 30: Jeff Mills - Changes of Life Episode 33: 808 State - Pacific State Episode 37: Cornelius - Raise Your Hand Episode 43: The Chemical Brothers - The Sunshine Underground Episode 46: Africa Bambaataa - Planet Rock Episode 48: Ryuichi Sakamoto - Ballet Mecanique It pretty much goes without saying that Eureka Seven is more than just your average animated series. It's a subtle tribute to so many aspects of pop culture, as well as the very elements that brought about inspiration to create the series. We're such a short amount of time away from witnessing the latest entry into the series, "Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution" in cinemas, and we can only hope this list allows you to view the film with a deeper level of excitement towards what's going on. While this absolutely isn't every single easter egg contained within the series, we encourage fans to perhaps rewatch the show with renewed excitement, or simply look forward to witnessing this all come to life on the big screen later this Fall.

What was interesting with this track, however, was its massive departure from the Ujico sound that we had all come to know and love, and I mean that in the best possible way. Amaterasu, this track mentioned above, was a glance into the dark, oriental vibe that the album would later build itself upon. Featuring scattered electronic beats combined with sounds plucked straight from the history books, Amaterasu won fans over enough for Ujico to continue working on this departure. Three short weeks later, we're graced with "Wonderworld," the latest eight-track album from Ujico following similarly to the previously released Amaterasu. Between the hard-hitting 'Reese Bass' sounds made prominent in tracks such as Sakura Nagashi, all the way to the subtle jitters of mayhem in Sazayoi Sakura, it's challenging to find fault in this departure from the typical up-tempo sounds Ujico had defined himself by prior. Released via the recently launched "CachetteNotes." doujin circle, Ujico has gone on to state that the release of this album marks a temporary departure from his usual "kawaii" sounds. If you're interested in supporting the release, it's available for purchase on all major distribution outlets, here.|Ujico, Snail's House, Wonderworld, Music, electronic, tokyo

Originally a webcomic jointly produced by the popular Harajuku fashion shop PARK Harajuku, Crunchyroll, Mugi Tanaka, and Patrick Macias, we're now launched onto the animated rails of an all-out sci-fi adventure taking place in Tokyo's fashion capital, Harajuku. Without sugar coating ourselves too much, that's pretty damn cool. For months now we've been writing about the upcoming anime, as well as all the adventures its staff has been partaking. These experiences would include appearances at both Anime Expo in Los Angeles, as well as Crunchyroll Expo in San Francisco more recently. One thing missing from all this writing? A look at the world of "Urahara" in motion. This changes now, however, with our first look at the anime via the series official YouTube channel, made available below: Oh, and did we mention the trailer finally shares the official premiere date? Beginning October 4, you'll be able to catch Urahara on Crunchyroll in North America, and on platforms like AbemaTV and bilibili in Japan and China respectively. I guess you could say we're a little excited. It's a less-traditional approach to so many dynamics within the world of anime, and that's precisely what we're so excited to see. Between the female-driven animation staff, all the way to the animation style, this is truly a series set to stand out from the rest. What are your thoughts leading into the anime? We can't wait to see how it pans out, especially with the significant role both Crunchyroll and Bilibili are playing in the co-production of the series.

11942|2017-09-11|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/shin-megami-tensei-liberation/| News | Games | 'Shin Megami Tensei' Mobile Game Previewed in Akihabara | If you're looking for your next pure 'Shin Megami Tensei' experience, you'll be gkued to your phone's screen soon enough. |It seems that these days, any mention of the Shin Megami Tensei series falls mainly under the umbrella of the massively-popular Persona 5, rather than within the realm of the outwardly bleak and relatively complicated world of turn-based demon fighting RPGs the series found its genesis in. That's understandable, however -- the Persona spinoff series placed the grim task of collecting mythical demons into the hands of a bunch of stylish and (mostly) relatable teens, and turned that burden into a unique form of self-expression. Slickly-produced and full of character, it's no wonder the Persona games have found a wider audience, and that's OK. It remains an undeniable fact however that the audience is still there for a traditional SMT experience, as evidenced by the success of Shin Megami Tensei IV on the Nintendo 3DS. What better way then, to migrate a bit of that casual audience back to the main series than through a casual mobile game? Announced just recently by Atlus as Dx2 Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation, currently you can catch a new trailer streaming only in Akihabara on a few of the otaku district's billboard-sized big screens. Luckily, the fine folks at 4Gamer recorded a bit of footage to share with the world over. Check it out below! The expected level of SMT production slickness is there, featuring stylish silhouettes of a handful of both guys and gals. I think the question here is pretty clear: to what degree, if any, will this game pull features everyone knows and loves from Persona? Will it be a bit lighter than the traditional SMT outing? Will there be any emphasis placed on "social links"? I think that for a social mobage, that idea could be kind of interesting if implemented in such away that allowed you to form links with your friends and other players. And at least in my mind, the rest of the game falls into place pretty quickly. Being a monster/demon collection RPG, there just has to be a gacha (random draw) system allowing you to score your favorite demons. I'm only dreading yet another addicting, yet hopefully, super-compelling mobage entering my life. May the gods (or devils) have mercy on us. We're expecting to see even more about the upcoming smartphone title at Tokyo Game Show as the trailer suggests, and for now, there's a website made available here.|Shin Megami Tensei, mobile game, mobage, Gaming, Video Games, Dx2 Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation, Sega, Akihabara
11941|2017-09-11|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/love-live-happy-party-train/| News | Anime , Music | Aqours' Second Tour Will be Screened in U.S. Theaters | Continuing the amazing trend of bringing idol lives to fans outside of Japan, Azoland Pictures will screen a special version of the 'Love Live!' group's 2nd tour in the U.S. |Fan participation is such a vastly-important aspect in the world of idols. For large groups like Akihabara's AKB48, the song and dance go something like this; buy CDs to make your favorite idol the most attractive, acquire tickets for in-person handshake events, attend concerts on the daily at AKB's specially-built theater. After all, the whole concept developed around the idea of "idols you can meet." When the idea went 2D (or rather, 2.5D), the aspect of fan participation was very purposefully and meticulously adapted. In addition to actually being able to attend very real concerts featuring the genuine talent behind the characters of the anime, fans have a strong arm in much of the decision making processes. Taking "Love Live!" as a prime example, and in particular with the recent second series "Sunshine!!," fans themselves voted on the group's name of Aqours and determined names of the group's sub units similarly. Until recently, this was very much something that fans could only experience if they were within Japan. Thanks to both the passion of overseas fans and the efforts a few companies looking to expand the reaches of the ani-idol world even further, however, being an "idol otaku" is a more inclusive experience than ever before. And I'm totally all for that. In a one-day theater event across the United States on October 14, Azoland Pictures will screen a recorded version of Aqour's second full live experience, the Aqours 2nd Love Live! HAPPY TRAIN PARTY TOUR. There's a full nationwide theater list that's available, and you can check that out to find your nearest venue at the official website here. Fourteen states across the United States are on the list, so there is a good chance that there will be something relatively close to you. Similar to both actual concerts and other live-viewing events hosted in Japan, fans are encouraged to come out and make some noise -- cheering, waving of penlights and wotageing are all encouraged. This event is not unprecedented, as the U.S. also received screenings five screenings of the first live, Aqours First LoveLive! ~Step! ZERO to ONE~. The increased number of theaters for this second tour speaks volumes about not only the franchise's success but also to the power of community within idol fandom as well. Aqours themselves have yet to hold full performances outside of Japan, but other idol groups, including their predecessor μ's, have found great success in doing so. And hey, the girls have already received multiple warm welcomes from the meet and greet events at Los Angeles' own Anime Expo. I believe it's only a matter of time before fans the world over will get to participate in the full live experience in their home countries. LOVE LIVE! SUNSHINE!!

11939|2017-09-10|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/re-zero-ova/| News | Anime | The Newly-Announced 'Re:Zero' OVA Episode is Looking Intense | The new 'Re:Zero' OVA looks to be the series' most intense episode yet, and we seriously can't wait any longer to check it out. |Ever since the final episode of Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World aired back in September of last year, fans like myself have been dying (that's some deep referential humor there) for any announcement of new content, whether that be in the form of a second season, a movie, or anything really. That wish has finally realized in the shape of an OVA, which is slated to be born into this world from (presumably) zero at some point shortly. The announcement came at the "MF Bunko J Summer School Festival 2017" event on Sunday. Take a peek at the preview trailer below. The scene unfolds at Roswaal's mansion, wherein Subaru seems tormented by what could only be his dreadful curse. Giving her all to take care of him, Emilia expresses her concern for Subaru's latest scourge. In what is shaping-up to be the series' most intense episode yet, it appears that Subaru and maid sisters Rem and Ram are involved in some kind of cook-off? Clearly, the stakes are high here -- undoubtedly our heroes have set out to appease some vicious demon possessive of a scarier name than "Gordon." Unless, of course, the scenes found in the preview have nothing to do with the contents of the OVA itself, which is a distinct possibility since the entirety of the trailer appears to be a dramatic buildup into Rem's saying that they're "making an OVA." Whatever it is, it can't come soon enough. If you haven't indulged in one of the greatest "isekai" (other world) anime stories in recent memory, I highly recommend checking out Re:Zero. Following is an official synopsis from Crunchyroll. Natsuki Subaru, an ordinary high school student, is on his way home from the convenience store when he finds himself transported to another world. As he's lost and confused in a new world where he doesn't even know left from right, the only person to reach out to him was a beautiful girl with silver hair. Determined to repay her somehow for saving him from his own despair, Subaru agrees to help the girl find something she's looking for... |Re: Zero, Tappei Nagatsuki, Kadokawa, Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-, EMT, White Fox

For those of you that aren't at all familiar, Steins;Gate Elite is an updated version of 2009's smash-hit visual novel from 5pb and Nitroplus. The website is currently listing all of the companies' Tokyo Game Show titles, and the Switch is clearly indicated as a platform for the release. As this information has not yet been formally announced, there is a possibility that it is simply an error on Sega and Atlus' parts. Though, considering the breakaway success of the Switch as a console, it makes a whole lot of sense that it would be released there. Players who visit the booth at Tokyo Game Show will also have the chance to score some exclusive goodies, as seen below. Steins;Gate, which is the 2nd entry in the "Science Adventure Series," has a reputation for being one of the greatest visual novels of all time. As the game was released in English after the runaway success of the fantastic anime adaptation, it served to introduce the world of Japanese visual novel titles to a whole new audience. Below, you'll find an official synopsis of the original English language PC release of the game, courtesy of JAST USA. Okabe Rintaro -- aka Okarin -- is an eccentric college student who dreams of conspiracy and chaos.

SERN, John Titor, the IBN 5100, the Butterfly Effect, and the 11 theories of time travel -- when chance brings these elements together in Akihabara, Japan, the fate of the world hangs in the balance.

Featuring a subdued color palette for a unique take on the series' traditional colors, perhaps one of the most stand-out details could be the packaging it all comes in. While New Balance might not be the sneaker giant they once were in the United States, here in Japan and also China it largely remains one of the big players. That's why for one of anime's biggest names like Evangelion to collaborate with the brand should come as little surprise. Tapping into the potential shown by the Fresh Foam Cruz sneakers, each of these colorways is looking to set you back about $100. Expected to release September 9 exclusively in Japan and China, the sneakers are slated to sell out fast. There's still no word on an international release for the sneakers.

The episode will only be available for streaming until September 18. For overseas audiences, there is, unfortunately, a second catch -- no subtitles are available apart from in Japanese language. While it remains to surface whether the series will receive any licensure outside of Japan, I still very much encourage you to take advantage of this gift. You can catch the full episode, entitled "Hoshizora-hen," or "Starry Sky Arc," below! What could call for releasing the entire 30 minute plus episode like this? As it would turn out, the story from this episode is being adapted into a full-on stage play, and will be performed at the Tokyo Sunshine Theatre between September 13 and 18. September 18 is also the last day to catch the episode online. Magical Suite Prism Nana is a franchise with a fascinating history. When the possibility of an original magical girl franchise featuring character designs from legendary moe illustrator Kantoku first arose back in 2012, I distinctly remember the hype. The announcement was hot on the heels of the success of Madoka Magica, and the world was itching for more original magical girl goodness. The following year, Shaft released seven promotional videos for the series, but aside from a few pachinko machines and Nendoroid figures, any new word on Magical Suite Prism Nana fell silent. Fast-forward to 2015, and the series' official Facebook page of all places announced that the elusive series was finally getting a proper OVA adaptation. The first episode became available with a limited theater run in November of 2015, and the second episode as seen above originally ran in April of 2016. The third of seven planned episodes is currently in production, but it remains to be known if the OVA series will get any official release outside of Japan. |Shaft, OVA, Magical Suite Prism Nana, Kantoku

We're very much trained to expect the unexpected from TRIGGER, and that often wields some pretty amusing results. What I'm getting at with all this is the recent illustration from "Space Patrol Luluco" character designer Mago shared on Twitter.

It's a service that has -- over the past several years -- bridged the gap between an entire generation of young Japanese pop culture fans and the content that further fuels their passion and hobbies. The very content that is made available on the platform has become a movement that's rapidly spreading across the globe, and standing at the forefront of this movement is Crunchyroll co-founder, Kun Gao. Heading to the San Francisco offices for Crunchyroll, we had the unique opportunity to sit down and have a discussion with platform co-founder Kun Gao. Throughout our conversation, we spoke about the past, present, and future of the streaming platform as it continues to develop as one of the largest anime communities around the globe.

11903|2017-09-05|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/bandai-actas/| News | Anime | 'Girls und Panzer' Studio Actas Acquired by Bandai Visual | The industry is likely to feel the ripples following a recent acquisition of the studio behind the 'Girls und Panzer' series by Bandai Visual. |The anime industry is a rapidly-morphing place. Just as one new studio has opened, so has another been fully-acquired. On Monday, it details emerged that Bandai Visual had bought a full financial stake in the animation studio best known for producing the red-hot "Girls und Panzer" series, Actas. The purchase concluded on September 1, followed by news that Actas will retain its name as a full subsidiary to Bandai Visual. According to the announcement shared on Netlab, the acquisition came to fruition with the primary goal of Bandai Visual acquiring the rights to "Girls und Panzer" with intent to grow the franchise and cultivate it into something even more impactful. This is a fascinating reason for a production and distribution company to acquire an anime studio, but it is a smart move considering how popular the "Girls und Panzer" franchise currently is here in Japan. With an upcoming OVA series set to be released theatrically, and a video game in development at Bandai Visual's parent company, Bandai Namco, they only stand to make huge gains financially. In addition to producing the "Girls und Panzer" theatrical OVAs, Actas has been cooperating with Studio 3Hz on this Summer season's popular "Princess Principal" anime. Being that it is not solely an Actas property, it is unlikely that Bandai Visual will be exerting any creative control of that franchise and its production. Jun Yukawa, who was a producer at Actas, has been named the subsidiary's new managing director. He is involved with the "Girls und Panzer" franchise in a big way, as he serves as the project's chief producer as well. The industry is has been in a constant state of flux as of late, what with the constant shuffling of studios, and even the constant movement between studios and even production companies and distributors of some key talent. The industry seems to be moving even more towards a close-knit structure, and it will no doubt be fascinating to see how this continues to play out and affect the creation of the content we've all come to love and adore.|Anime Industry, Actas, Bandai Visual, Girls und Panzer
11883|2017-09-05|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/fire-emblem-live-action/| News | Games | Nintendo Released a Wild Live-Action 'Fire Emblem Heroes' CM | It looks like 'Fire Emblem Heroes' may just be popular enough for the big screen? We can only hope. |The words "live action" are often enough to send most modern anime fans instinctively into a defensive stance. During 2017 alone, we've seen big franchises with huge international followings receive poorly received live action adaptations, with "Ghost in the Shell" and "Death Note" notably leading the pack. Video game movies don't necessarily have the greatest rep either but leave it to Nintendo to release something that makes a small part of me wanting even more. I'm talking of course about the new "Fire Emblem" commercial released by the team at Nintendo. Check out the slickly-produced commercial for the game below. Truthfully speaking, it honestly feels like a big-budget preview trailer you'd see before a Summer blockbuster in a theater: A diverse cast with some pretty elaborate costumes, all representing some fan-favorite characters like Ike and Lyn -- it's enough to draw my attention at least, even if not at the game itself. I'd watch a fully fleshed-out TV show full of this stuff for sure. "Fire Emblem Heroes" is a hit mobile game that serves as a bit of a simplified version of the tactics games we know and love, with an added character drawing mechanic or a "gacha" as it is known to hardcore mobile game players, thrown into the mix. Players love the thrill of summoning new characters to see if they obtain one of their series' favorite heroes, or end up being sorely let down. Either way, the game serves as a great bit of fan service, and Nintendo is looking to cast their net even further. Interestingly, the English version of the commercial above doesn't feature any of the voice over bits found in the Japanese version, so you can check that one out below if you'd like: What do you think? Would you watch more? Should we just leave it at that and proceed to play more of the actual games? Have any thoughts on live action adaptations?

Finding a comfortable place in my most influential animated series' of all time, Shuuichi Shigeno would primarily define my interests in both vehicles and music for a portion of my life. That's why when news of a new series from that very same creative mind surfaced months ago; I was a little more than excited. If you're not at all familiar, "MF GHOST" is the latest series from Shuuichi Shigeno and is currently being serialized in Young Magazine here in Japan. The story is set in the year 2020, which follows the life of Kanata Livington, a professional driver in a nation operated by autonomous vehicles. Following his graduation from a prestigious London driving school, Kanata returns to Tokyo to put his skills to the test. Coming in at a total of 40 pages within the series' first chapter, "MF GHOST" could just be the next big thing to fill the void left behind by the absence of "Initial D." From the very first page, we're instantly offered the tantalizing visuals of cars such as the GT-R and Lancer Evo taking to the starting line, all while retaining Shuuichi Shigeno's signature art style. If you're interested in checking out what could be the next big thing in the JDM manga scene, make sure you keep up to date with Young Magazine where the series is currently serialized. |Initial D, MF Ghost, Shuuichi Shigeno, Manga, Kanata Livington, Young Magazine, Kodansha
11882|2017-09-04|09:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/travis-strikes-back-story/| News | Games | Suda51 is Quick to Share More on 'Travis Strikes Back' | The much-hyped 3rd installment of the cult-hit 'No More Heroes' series may have just been revealed mere days ago, but we're already getting some brand-new info! |When Suda51's studio Grasshopper Manufacture crashed the end of Nintendo's recent Summer Nindies Showcase event, most were floored by the announcement of a third installment in the cult-hit series Nioo More Heroes. With the second, and until recently last installment releasing seven years ago in 2010, many weren't sure what to make of the fate of the series. Our beloved moe-loving assassin has returned at last, and Grasshopper was thankfully quick to share some more details. First and foremost, the game will be a 3D action brawler in the same vein as the previous two games in the series. Admittedly, after the trailer debuted there was some small fear amongst fans that it wasn't going to be a traditionally-styled No More Heroes experience but more of a mini-game collaboration with various indie game makers. That is not the case though, as Travis will indeed be slicing and dicing his way through different worlds inspired by indie titles in the same way we know and love. In addition to a Hotline Miami crossover, Grasshopper has now confirmed that Shovel Knight will also be heavily featured. A ton of beautiful concept art has surfaced as well, so be sure to scroll through it in the gallery below. Check out the official synopsis for the game from Grasshopper Manufacture below: Grasshopper Manufacture, an award-winning Japanese developer of videogames is delighted to announce the return of Travis Touchdown in Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, due for release for Nintendo Switch in 2018. Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes is a raucous 3D action title, where Travis touchdown wields the Beam Katana to massacre his way through countless enemies, taking on ferocious bosses in an epic b=attle with Badman. This marks the first time in ten years that SUDA51 has taken on the mantle of director. “We’ve received a tremendous amount of support from our fans over the years, and we are delighted to finally share Travis Touchdown’s next great adventure with fans of Nintendo Switch,” said Goichi “SUDA51” Suda, founder of Grasshopper Manufacture. “We’re ecstatic to be expanding the No More Heroes universe in 2018, and we can’t wait to share more information with you in the coming months.” Set in the remote countryside of the southern US, one year has passed since the events of No More Heroes. Badman has come to exact his revenge on Travis for the murder of his daughter, Badgirl. As the two foes are battling it out, they’re sucked inside the phantom game console ‘Death Drive MK-II’, a machine developed by Doctor Juvenile. It is said that whomever collects and beats all six of its games will have their wishes granted. Travis Strikes Back: No More Heroes will be released exclusively for the Nintendo Switch in 2018.

What I find particularly unique about this phenomenon is that the VR revolution doesn't seem to be stemming from people's living rooms, but rather from the depths of large and lavish "VR game centers," taking a page from Japan's ever continuing love for the traditional video game arcade experience. We wrote at length about "VR Zone Shinjuku," a massive new complex opened in the heart of Tokyo by Bandai Namco. When it opened this past July, the Zone was already home to not only one Gundam experience, but also a whole other mecha-based experience in the name of Evangelion. With their newest entry to the already robust palette of 15 unique VR experiences, Bandai Namco wants to put you right in the cockpit during an epic Mobile Suit battle. Take a look at the teaser for "Mobile Suit Gundam: Battlefield Bonds VR Prototype Ver." below: From the looks of things in the trailer, it certainly seems as if participants will be able to sit in a cockpit-like setup, though it is a bit unclear as to what the contents of the experience will be. Will you be participating in a more traditionally-styled game, shooting enemy craft out in the battlefield of space? Will it be more of an aural experience on-rails, wherein you are dragged around through the heat of battle? Whatever the case, we can expect to see more information come September 14, so be sure to check back as we bring you the latest about the project!

Of course, some of the entries on your job description may include the promotion of the talent that you represent, and you're probably looking to tie your client up with the biggest and best in the musical world. You'd want to get them slots at all of the most major music festivals. You'd want to get their music in advertising or use it in a commercial environment.

Sunshine!!" take place. The aquarium has hosted events for the show before, and they were successful enough to warrant a second go-around. The escape room is set to debut on March 19, 2018, and will run through June 3. That certainly gives you plenty of time to plan a trip with a stop in Numazu comfortably included. According to the official site, there is a bit of lore at play behind the experience. The girls have received a mysterious hand-scrawled note informing them that the CD they need for a performance in Tokyo has been stolen and that if they want to retrieve the contents, then they had better get on a non-suspicious boat and head for this island full of puzzles. They need your help here! The room will be sprinkled with a ton of lovely series touches, including a companion app that will allow you to receive instructions on getting through the room with the help of the various members of Aqours. There will also be a ton of exclusive goods available, and I sure hope that there are plenty of opportunities to get my hands on merch featuring their detective outfits. In addition to being just whimsically-designed, the official site hosts the high-quality version of the detective artwork, so I recommend visiting it.

Rattling us all with the return of perhaps his most beloved character, Travis Touchdown. Take a look at the trailer below, complete with the essential Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture flair: The events of Travis Returns: No More Heroes take place at an undisclosed time after the events of the original No More Heroes. You may recall a boss character in that game known as "Bat Girl," and it looks like daddy's out for some vengeance! The intriguing part of this triumphant return is an official crossover with other indie developers. Hotline Miami was featured heavily in the trailer. And that evil video game console with hands? That thing is apparently going to send Travis through the worlds of tons of other games, where he will have to face off against their crazed enemies and bosses. Oh, and there were quite a few pop-culture references sprinkled about as well. The most striking being the game's title font, which seems to ape that of Netflix's original show Stranger Things. I think it's pretty safe to say that Suda is a fan. What with the title being pretty much just a massive crossover with other games itself, I'm sure there are plenty of little goodies and easter eggs left for us to discover. The game will be Suda's return to full-on direction since the original back in 2007. We eagerly await thine benevolent and giving hands, Suda51!|Gaming, Video Games, No More Heroes, Travis Touchdown, Suda51, Travis Strikes Again No More Heroes

As soon as the clock struck midnight on August 31, JST, Hatsune Miku officially celebrated her tenth birthday. She's a rather simple girl, and only desires what most virtual pop stars around her age would -- an absolute fire collab with DJ Khaled. birthday wish is this https://t.co/SobB3n5Y45 — Hatsune Miku (@cfm_miku_en) August 30, 2017 Oh, and of course 39 million followers on Twitter, which would allow her to say that she has "mi-ku man" followers in Japanese. Piapro is celebrating the event in force, mostly through an expansive gallery of fan artworks and creations on their site. I urge you to check them out here. And finally, as our own way of wishing the turquoise-tinged musical goddess of our hearts a happy 10th Anniversary, we'd like to reiterate some of our favorite songs. Check them out below, and here's to another 10, no, 39 years of Vocaloid bliss! 1. Tell Your World (livetune feat. 初音ミク, 2011) Tell Your World is the song for Vocaloid creators worldwide. A smash-hit song by popular Japanese electronic musician livetune, it weaves the tale of how Hatsune Miku aims to unite the world with her song. It acted as a beacon of inspiration for Vocaloid creators too, aligning perfectly with their own goal of uniting their communities through Vocaloid. 2. Redial (livetune feat. 初音ミク, 2013) As livetune’s second entry on this best-of list, Redial is not only notable for being the official theme-song accompanying the release of Mikupedia, but also for its extremely beautiful and stylish use of CG in its original music video. Setting the bar for what would be considered the standard of quality amongst Vocaloid producers, Redial is still considered by many to be not just an incredible Vocaloid song, but an all around amazing song in general. 3.choco-mint flavor (bothneco feat. Hatsune Miku, 2012) A beautiful departure from your typical Vocaloid track, choco-mint flavor by bothneco introduced fans of the vocalized synthesis program to a new world of sound. Categorically falling under the sub-genre of music known as shoegaze, choco-mint flavor exists as a gorgeous look into Hatsune Miku’s more mellow side. 4. Black Rock Shooter (ryo, 2008) Ryo of supercell, the group behind ultra-popular anime songs featured in series like Bakemonogatari, alongside Huke, the artist behind the character designs of visual novels and anime such as Steins;Gate, teamed up to bring us Black Rock Shooter. This song was so popular, it inspired 2 different anime adaptations! 5. Senbonzakura (Kurousa-P, Itto Maru, 2011) Now here’s one for the history books. Senbonzakura features a tune that is reminiscent of Meiji-era Japanese politics and revitalization. Being that the song itself is a product of the post-war era, it offers a noticeably deep insight into both the realities and thinking of a country deep within in the throes of a transitional time.|Hatsune Miku, DJ Khaled, Piapro

It seemed like the only thing that was missing to this point was, in fact, the anime adaptation, and if emerging rumors hold any value, we just might have this final piece of the puzzle fall into place. It all begins with an updated piece of character artwork for fan-favorite from "Fire Emblem Awakening," Lucina. Soon to be released as part of a new event in the mobile game "Fire Emblem Heroes," eager fans have been studying the fresh take on their beloved princess. As these things tend to go, absolutely no stone could be left unturned, and fans from Reddit even took it upon themselves to translate the in-game universe's text on her lance. The discovery is a little mind-blowing and quite the tease. Anime project? "Fire Emblem"? There is certainly an old OVA series from clear back in 1996 which focused on the first game in the series, "Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light," but there's no way that this fresh, new character design would be referencing that, right? All signs are pointing towards the ultimate in fan wishing, and I've already seen plenty of people implore it to be pieced together by the team at ufotable, the talented artists who brought the stylish action of "Fate/Zero" to life.

Katsunori Shibata is practically an industry veteran at this point, having lent his skills to shows like 2009's "Maria Holic" all the way to "Flip Flappers" in more recent times. If anyone were to understand the true nature of the struggle newly-working animators in this industry go through, it would certainly be him. For that reason, Shibata has decided to step up to contribute in his way towards making the burden on his fellow creatives a little more manageable. Through a Tweet sent on on August 14, Shibata announced the beginning of his campaign, which he has set up on one of Japan's largest crowdfunding platforms, "Campfire." アニメーターを直接支援するクラウドファンディングを始めました、よろしければご覧いただき支援のご検討お願いいたします。 アニメーターに3万円直接支援 第2期！ - クラウドファンディングCAMPFIRE https://t.co/Fmhq7wIQQx — 柴田ブッチャーズ勝紀 (@amune1) August 14, 2017 At the outset, the goal was modest. If the amount of 110,000 yen (about USD 1000) could come to fruition, then he would distribute that money evenly to three animators who had contacted him at random. There was an incredible outpouring of support amongst fans who feel very strongly about the issue, and as of this writing, the amount raised is now sitting at a whopping 1,188,000 yen (about USD 10,830). That's 1080% the original goal, and there are still sixteen days left in the campaign. As a result of eclipsing the campaign's goal, Shibata will readjust the parameters of animators who can be selected, and the amounts which they will receive. Animators in Japan, many of who find themselves situated in Tokyo, struggle to make ends meet with a salary that usually does not breach USD 1000 every month. This campaign, along with efforts from other charities and NPOs like Animator Supporters, are not only established with the goal of helping our favorite creatives out financially at the moment, but they also aim to spark a broader conversation about what can be done to improve working conditions in the industry overall. As this is also an issue I care deeply about personally, keep it locked for all the latest in industry goings-on.

It was flashy, stylistic, and had an entire 23 episode run; but that wasn't enough to satisfy the desires of a whole audience, and it turns out it might not have even been enough to meet the desires of series concept planner Hiromi Wakabayashi either. With an ending like that, how could it be left there anyway? That's where Wakabayashi's latest doujin series, "Cemetery Hills" comes into play. For years now there's been a string of confusion surrounding the second season of "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt." Is it ever going to happen? Was it just a hoax all along? What will happen now that most of the series' staff jumped from Gainax to TRIGGER, all while the former still owns the rights to the series? Ultimately, there are an entire plethora of unanswered questions. It turns out that Hiromi Wakabayashi was working on this all along, however, and as of right now, "Cemetery Hills" seems to be his best answer. Spoilers for those who haven't finished "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt" below. Do you remember the ending to "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt" where we find out that Stocking is a demon, right after she proceeded to cut Panty into a million tiny pieces? Well, that's where we find the story of "Cemetery Hills" kicking off. If you've never heard of "Cemetery Hills," I really can't blame you. It was a Comiket-exclusive release which is unlikely ever to be made available elsewhere. But contained within the pages of this doujin might just happen to be the continuation of the "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt" story everyone has been so desperately waiting for all this time. We open with our story protagonist Briefers Rock -- referred to throughout by his pet name Geekboy -- and Chuck as they begin their journey to Oten City in an attempt to gather all the scattered pieces of Panty. Throughout their adventure, they face a series of challenges that eventually lead to them rebuilding Panty and defeating Stocking's ghost, and that's all just within the first episode, "Geekboy Homecoming." Though it may not be the anime format we're all used to, the doujin illustrated novel format allows for a new angle of creativity. Filled to the brim with the same signature charm that made "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt" so great in the first place, "Cemetery Hill" is a legitimate rush and a physical, tangible glance into the second season we've been waiting to get our hands on for so long. It's unfortunate that it'll be so difficult for the vast majority to own a copy of their own unless they just so happen to luck out on an online auction, but if that's what it took to make this a reality, then it's a more than reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts, did you know that the "Cemetery Hills" doujin even existed? If you did happen to get your hands on a copy, how did you feel about it? I can only dream that we'll some day be able to see this on our screens in anime format, but for now, we'll just have to compromise.

11835|2017-08-29|00:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/a-silent-voice-theaters/| News | Anime | 'A Silent Voice' to Receive the US Theater Run it Deserves | One of last year's most powerful anime films is finally coming to a widespread US audience. |Announced at Crunchyroll Expo over the past weekend, anime fans in the US can expect a theatrical run of the spectacular "A Silent Voice" beginning October 20, courtesy of Eleven Arts. ​ For Japanese cinema, and especially for theatrical presentations of anime, 2016 was an absolute banner year. Not only did you have the perennial hit of "your name." breaking multiple box office records for animation both domestically and abroad, there were quite a few gems that managed to fly a bit under the radar, but stun everyone who did, in fact, have a chance to see them. "A Silent Voice," based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima, was one of those films. It's an absolute treat for the senses, having received what could only be a lavish budget allocated especially for Kyoto Animation's film projects. It was directed by Naoko Yamada, who also served at the helm of a few other of the studio's theatrical releases, including "Tamako Love Story" and the "K-On!" movie. The films"your name." and "A Silent Voice" are often compared amongst a die-hard circle of fans, and there is even a bit of a rivalry that has sprung up between the two groups in attempting to establish which is the superior film. It's true -- both films are technical marvels. They push the limits of what the power of animation as a medium can convey, and they both climax with absolute gut-punches of emotional storytelling. As an individual who has had the opportunity to see both films, it's an argument that I strive to avoid. At their cores, there is a striking discrepancy of appeal between the subject matter of the two films, and if for no other reason than this, it is easy to see why "your name." enjoyed the broader cultural success. I have to say it outright -- "A Silent Voice" deals in some pretty uncomfortable subject matter. It is arguably for that very reason that it deserves your attention. The trailer you can view below is from the movie's UK cinema run: When "A Silent Voice" completed its theater run, it managed to land itself as the 19th overall highest-grossing film in Japanese theaters throughout 2016. It made a total of 2.3 billion yen ($19.56 million USD). As a comparison, "your name." was the highest-grossing film overall last year, and it made 20.5 billion yen ($174 million USD). An official synopsis of the story from the original manga has been provided by Crunchyroll: I wish we had never met. I wish we could meet once again. A boy who can hear, Shoya Ishida, and a transfer student who can't, Shoko Nishimiya. One fateful day, the two meet, and Shoya leads the class in bullying Shoko. But before long, the class shifts its target from Shoko to Shoya. Years later, Shoya feels strongly that he must see Shoko once again. An official debut date of October 20 was revealed by Eleven Arts this past weekend at Crunchyroll Expo. You will definitely want to keep an eye on their official site in the coming days for more details on screening locations and how to purchase tickets. |A Silent Voice, Koe no Katachi, Aniplex, Aniplex of America, Movie, Theaters, Theatrical Release
11833|2017-08-28|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/yomawari-midnight-shadows/| News | Games | 'Yomawari' May Look Cute, But Looks Can Often Kill | 'Yomawari: Midnight Shadows' is an absolutely adorable-looking game, but hiding behind the cutesy veneer is one of the most interesting-looking horrors I've encountered. |When Yomawari: Night Alone was released for the PlayStation Vita outside of Japan in October of 2016, it was a rather subdued affair. As you may know, the Vita has not been the most popular of consoles, but many of the games that do find a manner of success on the platform can usually be classified as a cult hit. As a huge fan of Night Alone, I'm absolutely ecstatic that its successor will potentially find an audience many times its size. A brainchild of the incredibly talented developers and artists over at Nippon Ichi Software, the Yomawari (Wandering at Night) series draws loads from the developer's knack for adorable, chibi-inspired anime art, but opts to flip the innate sense of security and familiarity you get with that on its head. The flashlight-centered exploration is at the heart of this effect. As you wander through the typical town setting and weave your way in and out of buildings, you'll happen upon monsters and supernatural apparitions grotesque in nature and clearly out for blood. The resulting experience is not only one steeped in a constant sense of dread, but it is also one that can blast you with potent moments of sentimentality when it really wants to, of course in no small part due to the game's stunning atmosphere and musical score. Now, you have more choices than ever when it comes to getting your atmospheric horror fix. Yomawari: Midnight Shadows will be released on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and for the PC. Check out the trailer below, but make sure you have a flashlight handy: NIS America describes the game as such: A summer night out with your best friend to watch the fireworks leaves you alone and scared in the dark. Pick up your flashlight and take on the views of two protagonists, Yui and Haru. The two girls have been separated by something seemingly sinister, and it is up to both of them to find each other in the night and make their way home. Along the journey, spirits, ghouls, and strange monstrosities will try to eat both of them whole. So find each other before it’s too late, because the dark is no place to be alone.

What the team at Gray Parka Service, in collaboration with HAL Laboratory, have managed to create transcends that stereotype, all while creating a genuinely incredible piece of clothing made available at a more-than reasonable price point. I'm talking of course, about their recent "Kirby Super Deluxe" sukajan. In celebration of our adorable pink best friend's 25th anniversary, we find ourselves blessed with this incredible testimony to video gaming history. The sukajan craze has been ridiculous over the past couple of years, and that makes this the perfect time for both Gray Parka and HAL Laboratory to capitalize on it all. Featuring the same design showcased on the original 1996 SNES cartridge on the rear of the jacket, as well as some adorable in-game sprites on the front, it's difficult to imagine my wardrobe without this. Priced at 6,800 yen, the piece will be available in standard Japanese S, M, and L sizes and is listed as a unisex article of clothing. It'll be available November 30 online and is set to be available for order from September 9 at select locations. Further information will be available from the store's official website, here. Will you be picking up one of these Kirby sukajan? What are your thoughts on this "recent" crossover between the worlds of fashion and anime/gaming?

Following his recent wave of success, however, there's perhaps no better climate to announce the release of his fourth album, "BOOTLEG", which is set to release November 1, 2017. Featuring a total of 13 tracks, the release will be accompanied by a Japan-wide tour from November 1 through until December 24, 2017. When it comes to musical talent here in Japan, there's perhaps none who are being launched into the spotlight more than Kenshi Yonezu. Between his musical work with various big-name animated series and films such as "March Comes in like a Lion", "My Hero Academia", and more recently, "Fireworks, Should We See It from the Side or the Bottom? ", it's been an extremely busy time for the 26-year old musician. Besides his work under the Kenshi Yonezu name, however, we've also seen a recent release from his side-alias 'Hachi' where he went on to create the Mad Max-esque theme song for the annual Hatsune Miku festival Magical Mirai 2017. With the constant slew of quality releases from Kenshi Yonezu as of late, we couldn't be more excited for the upcoming release.

For some couples, that's a chapel-based wedding, but for others, it's a wedding at a local arcade fully equipped with a 2-player "Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion" cabinet. This rang especially true recently for a newly-wed couple in the Takadanobaba, Tokyo area who found themselves renting out an entire arcade and giving it the full red carpet treatment, all for their special day. 本日ミカドで貸し切りで結婚式を行われました 杉山和裕さま、由記子さま ご結婚おめでとうございます！ お二人の希望により、初めての夫婦喧嘩は「鉄拳6ＢＲ」で行われました 末長くお幸せに！ pic.twitter.com/TT90mZEWxy — 高田馬場ゲーセンミカド[MIKADO] (@babamikado) 24 August 2017 It's far from ordinary, but I'm sure they were perfectly okay with that -- and that makes it all the greater. After sealing the deal, the arcade shared the couple had their first "lovers quarrel" in the best way possible, which of course was within the world of "Tekken".

Known as Seiken Densetsu in Japan, other titles in the series have achieved a cult-like following, but none have captured quite the same level of action RPG bliss as the 1993 SNES classic. It has been re-released multiple times, most recently in the Seiken Densetsu Collection compilation on the Nintendo Switch, but this project is a whole new beast entirely. Square Enix has announced a full-blown, from the ground up remake of Secret of Mana, and it is coming in February of next year. The overall look and feel of the game have been kept intact, but the 2D sprites from the original have all been updated with refreshingly colorful, and dare I even say, adorable 3D models. In addition to the obvious visual overhaul, three other key updates have been identified. All characters will be fully-voiced, and you will have the ability to switch between English and Japanese. The soundtrack is also newly-arranged and will pay homage to the classic tunes found in the original. Finally, the title will ship with fully-fledged local multiplayer for up to three players, a boost from the original's two. Check out the trailer below for your first peek at the voices, visuals, and music. If you preorder the game on the PlayStation Network, you can look forward to instantly-usable PSN avatars, and in-game costumes obtainable on the day of the game's release. PlayStation Blog describes the story: Randi inadvertently discovers the Mana Sword, a weapon of great power, and finds out that he can harness the great power of Mana. He then embarks on a quest to defeat the evil forces attempting to control Mana, and is joined by a tenacious and caring noblewoman named Primm, and a mischievous yet kind sprite named Popoi. Together, the trio take on a treacherous empire in attempts to bring balance to the world.

As a streaming platform for Japanese anime and Asian drama, Crunchyroll has firmly cemented itself as one of the premier destinations for legal viewing of some of our favorite forms of entertainment, and have remained a positive force in the industry due in no small part to the amazing care they tender to fans and subscribers. The company has dipped its toes into other areas of the industry, including manga simul-publishing, the investing of its own cash into the production committees for new anime works, and even physical home video distribution. The evolution is not stopping there, however -- Crunchyroll and its parent company Ellation, along with Japan's Sumitomo Corporation, have announced a partnership with mobile gaming developer and publisher Gree, wherein Crunchyroll will localize and distribute Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? Memoria Freese as the initial phase in a long-term partnership. I've checked out this game myself, and it really is such a treat for fans of the "Danmachi" series. In a traditional "mobage" sense, you are tasked with drawing characters from the series of varying rarity with a currency that you earn either in-game or by spending real money, and pitting them against ferocious monsters in the dungeon as you battle your way through the game's story and multiple quests. The game is developed by Gree's internal developer, Wright Flyer Studios, and has seen much success -- it has achieved over 3 million downloads across both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. The terms of the partnership have Gree handling the day-to-day development and operation and copyright of this title and any future games, while Ellation and Sumitomo will handle the localization, promotion, and distribution of the content. Gree's press release makes mention of PC games as well. As Crunchyroll continues to grow as an all-encompassing publisher of Japanese entertainment content, it will be interesting to see exactly how far the company's reach will expand. Will we soon be seeing the first official console video game releases under the Crunchyroll name? Only time will tell!

11800|2017-08-25|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/ni-no-kuni-two/| News | Anime , Games | Ni no Kuni II is a Sensory Treat From Some of Anime's Greats | Calling on the talents behind some of Studio Ghibli's biggest hits, 'Ni no Kuni II' is looking like a worthy successor to one of my favorite RPGs of all time. |When the original Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was released worldwide for the PlayStation 3 back in 2013, it ended up being my absolute favorite video game that year. In addition to the action-RPG, monster-collection-focused gameplay, the audio and visual experience that the title offered was enough to practically move me to tears. The artistic direction for the title came from the creative minds at Studio Ghibli, who have said that they approached this game just like they would have approached one of their films. One of my absolute favorite aspects of the first title was the musical score by Joe Hisaishi, famed composer known for his personal and artistic bond with legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki. And while Studio Ghibli in its previous form will not be associated with this sequel, many of the creative minds from the original will be returning. As you watch the trailer below, I would urge you to soak in the pure auditory bliss that is Hisaishi's score: Yoshiyuki Momose is an artist and animator who has notably worked on such anime as Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes. He is onboard the project as character designer, and it really shows. We've seen our fair share of games -- whether they be RPG, hack 'n slash action, or even arcade-style shooters -- unquestionably up-the-ante when it comes to anime-inspired graphics as of late, but I dare suggest that this may be the closest we've ever come to tearing down the wall between animated frames and real-time computer-generated action entirely. Ni no Kuni II is shaping up to be a video game adventure for the ages. If it can succeed in holding onto the the artistic magic of the original, all while blowing our expectations out of the water with some much-hyped and proposedly polished gameplay, we've likely achieved video-gaming Nirvana. Ni no Kuni II will be released for the PlayStation 4 and PC on January 19, 2018.|Ni no Kuni, Ni no Kuni II, Video Games, Gaming, Joe Hisaishi, Level-5, Bandai Namco

Beginning just 5 days from now on August 30, if you have obtained the Dream Egg item from the Moogle Chocobo Carnival within Final Fantasy XV, then you will receive a special Assassin's Creed outfit for use within the game. If it wasn't already awesome enough to run around the huge world of Eos cosplaying as Noctis' (presumably) favorite Assassin's Creed character, then you only have to wait one additional day; on August 31, the free "Assassin's Festival" DLC will be released, and you can check out all of the details of what that entails in a trailer I never expected to see in my lifetime below: According to Ubisoft's official blog, the idea was born when the developers of the two franchises had a chance meeting at the Tokyo Game Show a whole three years ago. They shared a mutual love and respect for each other's work, and thus an amazing idea was born. Finally coming to fruition this year with the release of Assassin's Creed Origins, the two parties have released an incredible piece of artwork featuring protagonists Bayek and Noctis to mark the occasion. If you were an attendee at Germany's Gamescomwhere the crossover was officially unveiled, then you were also able to get the poster signed by both Hajime Tabata and Ashraf Ismail, directors of Final Fantasy XV and Assassin's Creed Origins respectively. Despite how absolutely wild and unexpected this announcement may be, apparently, the hints were all there under our nose. In previous trailers for the two games, eagle-eyed fans have spotted easter eggs that hinted at this collaboration from as far back as last November. I have to admit though, that this actually is cool as heck. It's great to see two hugely-respected developers share in their fandom for something that we all love -- video games, with no mind of where they came from or who produced them. I mean anyways, if Ariana Grande can get a collaborative spot in the world of Final Fantasy, then surely Assassin's Creed can too.|Final Fantasy, Assassin's Creed, Video Games, Gaming, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Final Fantasy XV

We shared recently that construction on the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam had begun, including some pretty incredible images of the process, though it was still unconfirmed at the time when it would be open to the general public. Whilst the original RX-78-2 Gundam stood an enormous 18-metres tall over Odaiba, we can expect the newer RX-0 Unicorn Gundam to tower above all else at a massive 24-metres tall. The life-size replica model originally made waves globally following news that the massively-popular RX-78-2 was being removed, which was then later revealed to be in an effort to make way for the RX-0.

11765|2017-08-23|16:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/studio-bibury/| News | Anime | Say Hello to 'Bibury', the New Anime Studio on the Block | It's not easy to get your name out there as a new studio in the anime industry, but Tensho, a director well known for his work on the 'Grisaia' anime series, believes 'Studio Bibury' has what it takes. |The current anime industry is one that produces a rather extraordinary amount of content. If you were to compare the output of the industry today to say, Fall of 1995 when Evangelion started airing, there's quite a stark difference. At that time, an average of seven new shows were debuting every season, but now that number can be as high as thirty-five or so. This all can mean quite a few things -- anime is certainly more popular than ever, and there is more content for fans. The number of people who have actively wanted to become a part of anime has grown by leaps and bounds as well, even if the workload can now be grueling and offer some stunningly low payout in many cases. For that reason especially, I'm hopeful that this next bit of news and other cases like it serve to alleviate that burden a little bit. A new anime studio is opening in Tokyo, and it will be known as Bibury Animation Studio. The studio has been founded by the distinguished director known as Tensho, who has worked on series like Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic, the three Grisaia anime series, and Rewrite. Before his directorial work, he served as an animator and character designer under the moniker of Motoki Tanaka. The name of the studio itself is the same as Bibury, a small town south-central England, and the exact location of all the scenes in England from Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic. Judging from the studio intro video above and his past work, it's certainly apparent that Tensho has an attachment to the country, and it will be fascinating to see what else comes from that. Bibury Animation Studio's first production has already been decided. They will be producing the next chapter in the Grisaia series, known as Grisaia: Phantom Trigger.

She has a non-human companion in the form of a wispy manta ray floating midair, and though we can't understand what it's saying, the girl certainly appears to be able to. Just what are they waiting for? What exactly did she grab near the end of the video? Where does that gigantic torii gate lead, if anywhere? TATSUKI, we may need a full 12 episode production stat!

11777|2017-08-23|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/fire-emblem-warriors/| News | Games | Fire Emblem Warriors Looks Like a Must-Have for Series Fans | Fresh sets of 'Fire Emblem Warriors' information has finally surfaced, and it really does all seem too good a package to pass up. |Nintendo has been having an absolutely killer time at Gamescom, an annual gaming industry convention in Cologne, Germany. Amongst all the news of Super NES Mini features, updates to both Splatoon 2 and Arms, one title continues to stand out in my eyes -- Fire Emblem Warriors. The Fire Emblem series has been a breakout hit amongst a diverse range of people ever since the worldwide release of Awakening for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. As it was strongly believed that the game was to be the very last entry in the series, the developers felt that they had to cram all of the great parts from past games into that entry, and that decision proved to be a great one. Fire Emblem Awakening was not only a hit with the series' core fans but it also generally appealed to the broader base of anime fans, due in no small part to the gorgeous character design and illustration by acclaimed artist Yusuke Kozaki. The game sold well, and that was enough to tell Nintendo that they had a winning recipe. There have been 2 mainline series entries since, along with one very successful mobile game -- the train doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon. How then, do you bring together all of the beloved characters from across a huge universe of games and stories into one massive, fanservice-laden party? I can think of three ways off the top of my head. First; a mobile game with a gacha (drawing) system. Check. Second; a fighting game with a huge roster. Third; a Warriors game. We're officially two for three now! Similar to Dragon Quest Heroes and Hyrule Warriors before it, Fire Emblem Warriors pits fan-favorite characters against swarms of enemies in the genre the teams at Koei Tecmo and Omega Force know best -- the hack and slasher. Check out some of the action in the newest trailer below. With the introduction of Camilla, Leo, Hinoka, and Takumi, that brings the current roster up to fourteen: Marth - Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon Chrom - Fire Emblem: Awakening Lissa - Fire Emblem: Awakening Frederick - Fire Emblem: Awakening Robin - Fire Emblem: Awakening Lucina - Fire Emblem: Awakening Cordelia - Fire Emblem: Awakening Corrin - Fire Emblem: Fates Ryoma - Fire Emblem: Fates Hinoka - Fire Emblem: Fates Takumi - Fire Emblem: Fates Xander - Fire Emblem: Fates Camilla - Fire Emblem: Fates Leo - Fire Emblem: Fates Both Awakening and Fates have some super-high representation here, and I can understand why -- these are the games responsible for catapulting the series' popularity into the stratosphere. They are the titles so beloved by not only fans of video games, but also by that crucial wider audience mentioned before. If Warriors really is to be the huge series brouhaha that many have been hoping for; if it really is to be a Fire Emblem fan's dream come true, then I definitely understand the desire for characters from the other thirteen games in the saga. And I'm hopeful. I know for a fact that these developers, perhaps even better than most, know how to cram a bunch of unique characters and move sets into their games. We saw it with Hyrule Warriors, so I'm sure we'll see it here, even if in the form of DLC. Another thing that the Warriors developers are known for is decking their titles out with nods and references to the base series, and that is present here in droves. You'll be able to perform a "critical hit" if you charge your meter enough, which is basically this game's version of individual characters' special moves. You'll be able to take advantage of a character pair-up mechanic, which in similar fashion to the main games will allow you to boost the stats of the character you choose to actively control. The weapons triangle is in full force, allowing swords to perform better than axes, axes to perform better than spears, and spears to perform better than swords. Oh, and of course any flying-mounted character will be especially weak to bows. When your character levels up, you're going to hear that very traditional series jingle. There's a support system present, so if you prefer to keep certain fighters in your ranks battle over battle, you'll be able to see their relationship grow and flourish through some special support conversations. And perhaps most hardcore of all? The game will definitely feature a permadeath option. If toggled on, any character that has been defeated will not be able to join the fight during the course of the story again. That to me might be the ultimate capture of the core Fire Emblem experience in a totally different genre -- you best be playing wisely, just as if it were a tactical RPG. What do you think? Is Fire Emblem Warriors shaping up to be the ultimate series crossover game? Are you absolutely clamoring for a certain character to be represented? Let us know through the comments or even on social media!

On paper, it's possibly been one of the biggest years for Nintendo in a long time. Within that magical first 24 weeks of the console-handheld hybrid's life, the Switch has already outsold its top competitor, the PlayStation 4, two-to-one in the home country of both consoles. Over that 24 week period, the Nintendo Switch saw more than 1.4 million hardware sales, compared to the PlayStation 4's initial 653,377 hardware sales. This just serves to raise one question, however; where are people even buying the Nintendo Switch here in Japan? I've made it no secret in the past that the Nintendo Switch is possibly one of the most difficult purchases I've ever encountered. Unlike other difficult purchases, however, it wasn't because I was double-guessing myself on how much I wanted the product. This time, I really, really wanted to get my hands on a Nintendo Switch, but simply couldn't due to a global lack of stock. Over the course of just a few short months, I witnessed what should have been a fun-filled console turn into its own pseudo-currency amongst online resellers, with their being entire periods of time where you'd find the Nintendo Switch selling for no less than $600 USD on Amazon. Let's look at a break down of the first 24 weeks of sales for the Nintendo Switch in comparison to the PlayStation 4: Switch PS4 Week 1 329,152 309,154 Week 2 61,998 65,685 Week 3 49,913 35,294 Week 4 78,441 29,677 Week 5 45,509 30,201 Week 6 41,193 23,327 Week 7 45,673 13,401 Week 8 48,694 13,034 Week 9 76,679 14,396 Week 10 47,911 12,712 Week 11 24,712 11,486 Week 12 26,114 8,480 Week 13 27,146 6,792 Week 14 23,524 7,543 Week 15 27,291 6,508 Week 16 37,709 9,466 Week 17 22,361 8,395 Week 18 25,805 7,009 Week 19 26,256 8,059 Week 20 31,906 7,876 Week 21 98,999 7,150 Week 22 89,314 6,456 Week 23 61,933 5,581 Week 24 87,798 5,695 Total 1,436,031 653,377 Interestingly enough, the only one time that the PlayStation 4 outsold the Nintendo Switch was during its second week of sales. Since then, it's been all smooth sailing for the Kyoto-based Nintendo. With a constant slew of major releases including the likes of "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", "Mario Kart 8: Deluxe", "Arms", and "Splatoon 2", it's been ensured that consoles would fly off the shelves faster than Nintendo can even manufacture them. It was so intense in fact that I had to import my own console from the United States with the help of a very courteous friend who happened to see a unit come in before it could even be shelved. With titles such as "Super Mario Odyssey" still to come later this year, I can't picture the sales slowing down anytime soon. It also remains to be seen whether the listed sales include resale units that have become such a hot commodity as of late here in Japan, especially with the console being so difficult to get your hands on retail. What are your thoughts, can you see the Nintendo Switch continuing its incredible sales record into the holiday season and onwards? I just hope they can sort out a few of their stock issues sooner rather than later. Source: Gematsu, 4Gamer, Nintendo Life|Nintendo, Switch, Playstation, sony, Sales, Japan
11771|2017-08-22|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/final-fantasy-xv-pc/| News | Games | 'Final Fantasy 15' is Finally Heading to PC Early 2018 | Didn't get a chance to enjoy the immersive world of 'Final Fantasy XV' on console? No worries, because it's finally heading to PC early 2018 with some major visual enhancements. |I'm not about to tell you the only thing that matters about gaming is how good a game looks, especially with how far removed that is from the truth, but what I am about to tell you is that I can't wait for another second to see how gorgeous the world of Final Fantasy XV looks when it comes out on PC early 2018. If you didn't get a chance to experience the expansive world of Final Fantasy XV on console when it initially released on both PlayStation and Xbox back in November 2016, then chances are that's all about to change. We all knew it was coming, but I don't think there was a single one of us that pictured it landing so soon. "Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition" is without a doubt the most powerful version of the game to date, and features a plethora of enhancements to make sure the game feels and plays as immersively as possible. Rattling off a list of new features, players will be able to dive head-first into the world of Eos in 4K high-resolution texture, with support for 8K gaming listed as well. Powered by Square Enix' "Luminous Engine", the studio is working closely with NVIDIA to add a suite of game-enhancing functions. From NVIDIA's "Realistic Grass Simulation" all the way to their "High-Quality Ambient Occlusion", the game is undeniably going to look gorgeous. With the massive push for PC gaming currently taking place in areas such as Akihabara, this news is likely just as welcome here in Japan as it is internationally. It's currently unknown what the minimum required specs are for your computer, but chances are it's time for an upgrade. What are your thoughts? Are you excited to play "Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition"? As someone who had to make the trek to visit a friend every time I wanted to touch the game, this is more than welcome news to my ears. |Final Fantasy, Steam, Square Enix, Gaming, PC

Scheduled to begin airing in October, the anime will be calling on the talents of Sumire Uesaka for the opening theme "Antithesis Escape", and Luna Haruna to perform the ending theme. Both Uesaka and Haruna find themselves commanding main character roles in the anime, with Uesaka voicing Mari Shirako and Haruno voicing Rido Sudou. Within the announcement, we're also given a look at three new characters to the series; Misa Maruno (voiced by Amano Kokoa), Sayumin (voiced by Riho Iida), and a fried shrimp (voiced by Yasunori Matsumoto). Each of the characters feature gorgeous designs and a clear personality, which can largely be attributed to the character design talents of Mariko Fujita and Mugi Tanaka. Based on the Crunchyroll-serialized web-manga "PARK Harajuku: Crisis Team!", written by Patrick Macias and illustrated by Mugi Tanaka, "Urahara" takes viewers on a sci-fi adventure through the real world locale of Harajuku and the culture that makes it so prevelant. It's undeniably one of my most anticipated anime, and I can't wait to see some of my favorite stores receive the anime treatment. You'll be able to check "Urahara" out in October, and can find further information on the series via the official website.

Unsurprisingly, the comment section of the film shows a wide-variety of mixed opinions, with it remaining clear that fans are equally divided on how to react. The sample's thirteen minute duration ends shortly after our first taste of the film's stand action, which I'm glad could be included.

Coming alongside that very announcement was news of an upcoming five-track EP, "MELANCOZMO", which would act as the entry point for many into the blip-filled world of TORIENA. Not even a month later, we're already beginning to see the release spring to life in the form of the EP's titular song "MELANCOZMO", which has received its own music video via the Toy's Factory Japan YouTube channel: Directed by the always-talented Toshitaka Shinoda, we're pulled into a hyper-stylish world of chaos with TORIENA front and center. The music video is a visual treat from start to finish, and perfectly accompanies such a powerful song. From the attention to detail with the costumes and beyond, TORIENA is undeniably leaving a major imprint on the mainstream music label scene. If MELANCOZMO is simply a sampling of the full upcoming EP, than I can't wait to see what the rest of the release brings to the table.

11760|2017-08-21|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/mario-kart-wii-mission/| News | Games | 9 Years Since Launch, Mario Kart Wii's Mission Mode Playable | Didn't know there was a mission mode in 'Mario Kart Wii'? We can't blame you, given Nintendo never intended for it to be playable. |It's been almost 10 whole years since the release of Nintendo's massively-popular "Mario Kart Wii", which originally released across the globe on April 10, 2008. Throughout those 10 years, we've witnessed both the birth and death of an entire community, with a handful of that community still finding themselves active even to this day. Recently however, we've seen a massive spike in interest in the game, and that can largely be credited to YouTuber MrBean350000vr. Some of you might remember the recent discovery of an unused and somewhat deleted Mission Mode within “Mario Kart Wii”, akin to that of the Nintendo DS version of the game. I’d been tuned in quite closely to the discovery, especially with the overall volume of the find. The discovery of a forgotten and abandoned game mode structured similarly to the handheld version I loved so much? Sign me right up. In the initial discovery however, it wasn’t much more than just that, a discovery. With nothing more than a barely functioning menu system, it’s an absolute wonder that MrBean35000vr was able to get much further. In an update to the YouTube channel that went live August 19, we're given our first major update to the progress made. What was initially a textless, functionless menu with some mysterious buttons is now largely a playable experience, give or take a few expected flaws. It's not perfect, far from it, but it's a little more than exciting to witness what could have been thrown on top of my enormous time spent in the "Mario Kart Wii" universe. Let's quickly breakdown what we're seeing in this video; for one, we're given our first look at what could have been the "Mario Kart Wii" equivalent to the "Mario Kart DS" mission mode. The mode was largely comprised of a series of tasks aimed at both teaching you various in-game mechanics and challenging the players. Through a series of trials and 'boss battles', the mode added a new layer of fun to the game that simply couldn't be achieved in the regular races. The Wii version largely encompassed that same style, and it's very much a mystery as to why it was cut from the finished product. So what are your thoughts on the mode? Would you have been interested in a mission mode within "Mario Kart Wii"? I for one would have loved to drop a portion of my life into it, and cant wait to see what further developments MrBean35000vr can bring forward. |Nintendo, Mario Kart, Wii, MrBean350000vr, Mission Mode

Showcasing a series of new story elements, and even a possible return to the Kanto region, fans of the series have a whole lot to disect in the first new trailer. Following shortly after was the upload of a short video announcing the new Z-Move for Kommo-o. Featuring two new unique looks for our main character, players are invited to adventure once more whilst remaining as stylish as ever. There's going to be new places to explore, and even more fresh content to enjoy building into the Ultra games. On top of all this we'll also have an all-new Z-Move to enjoy. Within mere minutes of the trailer being uploaded, viewers were rapidly pulling apart every little detail, which of course produced some pretty interesting results. Perhaps one of the most interesting however would come in roughly 14 seconds into the trailer, where we find the main character in an all too familiar location. Not quite sure what we're talking about? Check this out: Did #Pokémon #UltraSun #ultramoon trailer just confirm a return to Kanto region? Perhaps Lt. Surge's gym is just an Easter egg #Nintendo3DS pic.twitter.com/QdUZufoLeR — The Johto Press (@BertiiPerches) 18 August 2017 One of the most prominent aspects of the "Pokémon Sun" and "Pokémon Moon" games was the constant throw back to the second generation titles and their Kanto region setting. It was largely dismissed amongst fans as simple easter eggs scattered throughout the game, but perhaps this latest shot suggests they could mean so much more. With a November 17 release date for the titles however, we're still some ways off knowing. One can only dream of such a return to the Kanto region however, and we sure hope it happens.

The bouncy electronic single finds the six-member idol unit playfully embracing the summertime, all while infusing their own signature sounds and styles into the season. When it comes to emerging idol groups, there's none that I've found more intriguing than CY8ER. I'd be lying if I said I was a big idol fan, but I've always had a soft spot for the blending of electronic music with less-traditional idol sounds. That's exactly where CY8ER comes into all of this, they're an idol group who aren't afraid of being unconventional, and that's possibly one of their strongest points. Many might know them for their global headline-making stunt which saw them wearing hazmat suits for a fan meet and greet, but I'd like to hope most of you know them for their incredible musical value. Their latest single "Koi Natsu" is no exception, and is an excellent entry point for anyone not familiar with the group. Fresh off the group's "Lucid Dreaming Tour", it's impressive that the members were able to make the time to push out such a quality single. Pulling off a similarly excentric vibe to previous releases, "Koi Natsu" truly drives home the fact that CY8ER are a force to be reckoned with.

When Nintendo first revealed ARMS, I was more than a little bit skeptical. I wasn't sure how much I would be able to take of flinging my own arms in front of me for hours-long gameplay sessions at a time, but the deceptive depth of the gameplay and the charming characters were enough to keep myself and many other players hooked. And hey, the game will even be a headliner at the upcoming EVO JAPAN tournament. Now, Nintendo is making good on their promise of keeping the game fresh with new updates, characters and equipment. Check out this Tweet from the official Japanese account: カイチョ～！ちかごろ評判になっているファイターを撮影してきましたよ！夏休みついでに！ …個性的な衣装とアームですね…。詳しくは判りませんでしたが、体を何らか変化させて戦うスタイルのようでした！ あ、あとカメラ一台ブッ壊しちゃいましたテヘ！…始末書ですか…ですよね…！ pic.twitter.com/2yohkLWGww — ARMS（アームズ） (@ARMS_Cobutter) August 16, 2017 From what I can tell, the flexible new bruiser appears to be wearing extremely baggy pants, and is potentially wearing their hair in a bun. It'll be interesting to see if this character then, will in fact be a bit more vulnerable to lower strikes, while making up for it in an undoubtedly unique and ARMS-like way.

Set to hit cinemas across Japan August 18, the animated film follows a story of curiosity and young love. I've been saying that I want my first film I see in cinemas this year to be something special, and this might just have to be it. Japanese journalist Tatsuya Masuto has gone on to state the film goes above and beyond expectations surrounding the film, and even went as far as stating that the adaptation might even be better than the source material. Stating that the 90-minute run time compared to the 50-minute original film certainly helps add to the content, making it more than just a remake of a 90's classic. Others walked away from the film describing it as an emotional experience, defying the norms of anime. Set to be made available in more than 110 countries and regions, the film's high-praising reviews come as little surprise to anyone familiar with the high-standard that Shaft sets for their productions. Writing the film's script is Hitoshi One (Bakuman, Scoop!) with Nobuyuki Takeuchi (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Monogatari Series) acting as director.

Being the genius behind the characters of both CO;RYU and PARK Harajuku: Crisis Team, both of which are getting the anime treatment, her characters have largely gone on to define not just my personal interests over that period of time, but also my wardrobe. That's why I was so excited to check out the Crunchyroll blog today to find out that Mugi Tanaka will be making her way to the upcoming Crunchyroll Expo alongside "Urahara" series director Amica Kubo later this month. It's been a big month for Mugi Tanaka, perhaps better known by her handle @oplant online. Between the Summer Comiket release of her debut illustration book "Urban", a collection of illustrations between 2011 - 2017, her upcoming appearance at Crunchyroll Expo, mixed in with her already packed schedule with the "Urahara" anime, there's been a lot going on. Utilizing an extremely unique illustration style, there's absolutely no mistaking a Mugi Tanaka piece, so it's exciting to see the artist receiving further support internationally. Heading to North America alongside Tanaka Mugi will be "Urahara" series director Amica Kubo, who holds an entire list of awards to her name. Having graduated from the Tokyo Polytechnic University in 2007, Amica Kubo would go on to receive awards for her works "Bloomed Words", "WWF 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY" and "ONED". Taking on the role of director for the upcoming animated series, we're more than excited to see what direction she takes with the animated series. We've covered the upcoming "Urahara" series quite extensively in the past, so I definitely recommend checking out our archive for further information, here, including an exclusive interview with staff from both Crunchyroll and PARK Harajuku.

11726|2017-08-16|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/godzilla-anime-first-look/| News | Anime | First Trailer for the Upcoming Animated Godzilla Is Here | In the latest trailer released for the upcoming 'Godzilla: Planet of Monsters', we're given our first real look at the king of monsters, Godzilla. |We're just over 3 months away from one of this years biggest animated films, and I think my personal hype may be about at its peak. In a wave of information released today for the upcoming "Godzilla: Planet of Monsters" animated film, we got a look at a new trailer and teaser for the upcoming film, as well as an all new visual. Running for a little over a minute, the trailer introduces us to our main cast, as well as fading out with a shot of the king of monsters itself. The teaser is pretty much just a shorter version of the trailer, and the visual gives us a real look at Godzilla. Set to open in theaters across Japan on November 17, fans worldwide will be able to check it out on Netflix at a later date. Animated by Polygon Pictures, and distributed by Toho Animation alongside Netflix, the film is being helmed by both Kobun Shizuno (Detective Conan films, Elfen Lied, Evangelion: 1.0) and Hiroyuki Seshita (Knights of Sidonia, Ajin) as directors and Gen Urobuchi (Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, Psycho-Pass, Aldnoah.Zero) handling the story concept and screenplay. Essentially just take some of the most prominent names in modern anime and pit them together strategically appears to be the game played by this film, and I'm all for it. If you've got a moment to read the official synopsis for the story, it can be found below: The last summer of the 20th Century. That day, the human beings learn that they are not the only ruler of the planet Earth. The appearance of the giant living creatures “Kaiju's” and the ultimate existence that destroys all monsters: Godzilla. Through the battle against kaiju's that lasted for half a century, human beings has experienced continuous defeat, and finally plans to escape from the Earth. And in 2048, only those who were selected by the A.I. managed under the central government boarded the inter-sidereal emigrant spaceship “Aratrum” to head for “Tau Cetus e”, the planet beyond the distance of 11.9 light-year. However, the environmental condition differences between that of the Earth and Tau e, which they finally arrived after 20 years were far beyond the predicted numbers, and was not an environment considered to be habitable by human beings. The young man on the emigrant ship: Haruo, who saw his parents killed by Godzilla in front of his eyes when he was 4 years old, had only one thing in his mind for 20 years: to return to the Earth and defeat Godzilla. Shut out from the possibility of emigration, as the living environment in the ship deteriorates, the group of “Earth Returnists” led by Haruo became the majority, and determines to head back to Earth through a dangerous long-distance hyperspace navigation. However, the Earth they have returned has already passed the time of 20,000 years, and has become an unknown world with the ecosystem reigned by Godzilla. At the end, will human beings win back the Earth? And what will Haruo see beyond his fate? Can't wait for the upcoming Godzilla film? Don't worry, neither can we.

11716|2017-08-15|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/miyazaki-returns/| News | Anime | Hayao Miyazaki Returns to Studio Ghibli for Latest Film | Hayao Miyazaki is returning to Studio Ghibli after his short-lived retirement to work on his supposed final film, Boro the Caterpillar. |There are seemingly two absolute truths in this world; the Japanese anime film industry is going nowhere but upwards, and that you can't keep Studio Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki out of the office. In a recent statement sent out by Studio Ghibli, the gloablly-known animator is returning once more to begin work on his latest film, "Boro the Caterpillar". With today being his first day back in the studio office, it's already been reported that Miyazaki had been working on the film from his home studio for over six months. Joining him in the office will be a handful of new animators and background artists who answered the studio's call for workers ahead of the animated film. Unsurprisingly the applications were flooded, but what proved interesting was the fact that more foreigners than ever before also took the plunge and applied for the role. Those who were selected for the roles are set to begin work as early as next month. Hayao Miyazaki's last work with the studio was the 2013 "The Wind Rises", which was met with critical acclaim from new and old fans alike. The upcoming "Boro the Caterpillar" was originally conceived with the purpose of being a short-film made available only at the Studio Ghibli Museum here in Tokyo. After much disdain with the short however, Miyazaki quickly got to work into making this into a full-blown feature film released under the Studio Ghibli name. First thought up over 20-years ago, the concept for the anime predates even animated films such as "Princess Mononoke", one of the studios more acclaimed features. The short was originally described: "a story of a tiny, hairy caterpillar, so tiny that it may be easily squished between your fingers." I'm extremely excited to once again be enticed within the wold of Ghibli as Miyazaki works the magic that seemingly only he can deliver. If you're jumping up and down in your seat in anticipation for the film however, you're going to have to wait a moment. The film is currently slated for a 2019 release date, with little more than that timeframe known at the moment.

Though with any massive franchise, there has been one pretty big piece of the multi-media puzzle that has been missing up to this point: a notable video game release. With the exception of 2012's Bakemonogatari Portable for the Sony PSP, a simple visual novel affair, the series has been without a huge game release. That may be about to change. Aniplex has announced Monogatari Series Puc Puc, a mobile game to be released for iOS and Android platforms sometime before the end of the year. Gameplay looks relatively simple, as it tasks you with dragging matching characters across the board to match and pop them, heavily reminiscent of the ever-popular Disney Tsum Tsum. You'll be able to try your luck by rolling for characters from the series, some rarer than others, each with their own special ability and power up. I think I'm ready to be sucked into yet another "mobage" craze, as long as the prospect of drawing and playing with crazy adorable mini versions of my favorite characters lingers. Probably not the massive mobile game fans have been longing for, but a good piece of fun none-the-less. You're also able to check out the official Twitter account, where they have outlined the rewards that can be unlocked once a certain number of pre-registries occur: スマートフォン向けアプリゲーム「〈物語〉シリーズ ぷくぷく」2017年配信予定！本日より事前登録受付を開始致しました！事前登録者数に応じて「5 戦場ヶ原ひたぎ」のカードやゲーム内で使用できるアイテムをプレゼント！#物語ぷくぷくhttps://t.co/48ss5YdtYJ pic.twitter.com/2UTIGxXyN0 — 〈物語〉シリーズ ぷくぷく【公式】 (@monogatari_puc) August 12, 2017 At 30,000, all new players will receive tickets for 5 normal character draws.

The box will contain the long-awaited English dub, which calls on the talents of Xanthe Huynh (Sword Art Online, Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie –Rebellion-) as Menma, Erica Lindbeck (Your lie in April, ALDNOAH.ZERO) as Anaru, Ray Chase (Charlotte, Final Fantasy XV) as Yukiatsu, Erica Mendez (KILL la KILL, Magi franchise) as Tsuruko, Kaiji Tang (The Asterisk War: The Academy City on the Water, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works) as Poppo and Griffin Burns (Fate/Grand Order -First Order-, Charlotte) as Jintan. If you're looking for an anime that'll leave you in tears, all while offering a legitimately compelling story, look no further than "anohana - The Flower We Saw That Day". It's a series that doesn't come along all that often; a show that leaves you truly invested in the wellbeing of the cast, while then using that affection to hit the spots that hurt the most. It's perhaps to younger anime fans what Clannad was to older fans, even if the seperation between the two was only four years. Over six years on from its original airing, the series still finds wide-spread popularity amongst communities, and leaves ZONE's "Secret Base" stuck in my head on a daily basis. Apparently I'm not the only one who has had the series on my mind this whole time however, with the dub director Patric Seitz stating that it's been his dream for the last five years to work on the English dub for the series.

Aoba, Hifumi, Yun and Hajime have joined the ranks of one of Japan's biggest convenience store chains -- Lawson. Spanning two types of products, you'll be able to see the girls decked out not only in Lawson's iconic blue and white striped uniforms, but also in what appears to be a Lawson-inspired hybrid of the traditional sailor outfit and a maid dress. You'll be able to nab the friendly part-time workers on either a keychain or a clear file. Scroll through the pics below, and let us know which of these strike your fancy! These goods really do define the term "limited edition," too, as you only have two options available when it comes to getting your hands on them. You can either be at the Kanda Myoujin Lawson store in Tokyo beginning on August 18, or you can use the "Loppi" in-store terminal at any Lawson location in the country to order the goods for shipping to your home. Once they're gone though, they're gone. This promotion is one of those "while supplies last" kind of deals.

Unafraid of even his own publishers, it appears Bkub is this time pointing fingers at King Records, the publisher for the upcoming anime adaptation of "Pop Team Epic" in regards to an "error" on their behalf, which has pushed the anime back an entire three months. Posting a statement online simply wouldn't be enough for the 4-panel series however; they had to take it even further. ヤバイのおったぞwwww pic.twitter.com/dXnVFx33Wk — シギノ*デイリーカタギリ (@sh1gin0) 11 August 2017 If you were in the Ikebukuro area today, chances are you may have witnessed this piece of fine art driving around.

Printed loudly across the vehicle was a statement claiming that the anime has been deleyed due to an "Error on King Records behalf". Not to worry too much, the anime is still on its way and can be expected during the Winter 2018 anime season, starting in January. Though the anime's delay is a bit of a letdown, we can still take solice in the fact that the third season of the 4-panel comic series begins in October -- the original intended release date for the anime. Are you excited for the upcoming anime series? I'm still extremely curious to see how it's all pulled off, but have high hopes for the adaptation.

Keiichi Shigusawa's has been writing the beloved series since 2000, and the number of officially-released volumes has recently checked-in at 20. When it first received an animated adaptation in 2003 by the creative team at Studio A.C.G.T, it rapidly garnered a cult-like following amongst the masses. I distinctly remember the first time I ever laid eyes on the first Kino's Journey -the Beautiful World- anime; simply being taken aback with just how mesmerizing the whole series was. The characters of Kino and her talking motorbike Hermes were the perfect eyes through which to view a desolate, and somewhat lonely world. The atmosphere, coupled with the relaxing music and interesting theme wherein Kino never stays more than 3 days at any given locale in fear of growing the desire to settle down, well, it hooked me from the get-go. And now, more than 13 years later, we'll finally have the chance to experience that magic all over again. Check out the first animated trailer for Kino's Journey -the Beautiful World- the Animated Series (yes, the only distinguishing factor is the addition of "the Animated Series") by Studio Lerche below. Tomohisa Taguchi (Persona 4 The Golden Animation, Twin Star Exorcists) will be handling the directorial duties, while vocalist Nagi Yanagi will sing the show's opening and ending theme songs. The series is being animated by the team at Studio Lerche, with an October 2017 premiere date.

It's certainly kept me busy, but every now and then I'd spot a film that stood out from the rest. "No Game, No Life Zero" is a film that very much fits that bill for me, serving as a prequel for a series I personally hold quite dearly. Luckily, I had a chance to see the film in theaters here in Japan myself, and I can say with absolute confidence that it is worth its weight in a variety of categories. For those who have been dying for that little extra helping of "No Game, No Life" action, you won't be walking away disappointed. If you were excited at the prospect of an original sequel, then you are also in for a treat. Even though this film doesn't contain the same characters we've grown to know and love, voice actors from the original series have come back to voice our new protagonists. I'm confident that after you leave the theater, you'll see why that makes total sense. You'll probably even be able to glean some hints from the official poster below: It was recently revealed that American distributor Sentai Filmworks has picked up the film for theatrical release overseas. It's set to debut in Los Angeles on September 15 as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival, with a country-wide release to follow shortly thereafter. Sentai Filmworks has provided an official synopsis of the film: Six thousand years before Sora and Shiro were even a blink in the history of Disboard, war consumed the land, tearing apart the heavens, destroying stars, and even threatening to wipe out the human race. Amid the chaos and destruction, a young man named Riku leads humanity toward the tomorrow his heart believed in. One day, in the ruins of an Elf city, he meets Shuvi, a female exiled "Ex-machina" android who asks him to teach her what it means to have a human heart.

We're set to be seeing this film debut in Japanese theaters beginning on August 18, which at this point is just a week away, but who's counting. Undoubtedly however, one of the aspects of this project I'm most looking forward to is DAOKO's participation as the performer of the film's official theme song, which has just been released via DAOKO's YouTube Channel. The uploaded video, which is made available for streaming below, not only serves as the official music video for "Fireworks," but also doubles as one of the film's teaser trailers in a somewhat roundabout way as well, which I'm 200% down with. It's not like I'm jittering with excitement or anything, but I probably just have a sweet spot for anything Studio Shaft throws at me, especially when DAOKO is involved. You can check out the music video below: Here's everything we've learned from the video; we now know that DAOKO has collaborated on this particular song with singer Kenshi Yonezu, and I think it's fair to say that the two of them sound fantastic together. In addition to "Fireworks," DAOKO will also be performing a cover of Forever Friends, a song that served as the theme for the original 1993 live action drama. For a brief synopsis of the film, check out the passage below. This story takes place on a certain day during summer vacation. Before the local fireworks festival, a group of young boys are arguing amongst themselves: “If you look at fireworks from the side, are they round or flat?” In order to get their answer once and for all, they decide to climb the town’s lighthouse before the display begins. One boy of the gang, Norimichi, has a crush on the class idol, Nazuna. In a mysterious incident where time is rolled back, Norimichi finds himself invited by Nazuna to run away from home with her. What's got you excited about the film? For me, I know I can't wait to see the powerful combination of DAOKO and Shaft all wrapped up neatly into one gorgeous package.

Each and every one of his manga have left its own kind of impact on me, and that's probably not something I should be proudly proclaiming. I don't think there's ever been a manga that has sent more shivers down my spine than Uzumaki, especially through its incredible use of line curvature. There isn't a single panel in a Junji Ito piece that doesn't feel like it's actively moving, and funnily enough that movement is about to translate into the upcoming anime series that was teased just over a month ago. It's been almost a month that I've waited restlessly for any form of news, and today that news was finally delivered in the form of a new website packed with information. Let's disect this information dump a little; firstly, we can now rest easy knowing that the anime is just around the corner with a Winter 2018 scheduled premiere. Helming the project is the team from Studio DEEN, with Shinobu Tagashira acting as both director and character designer for the anime series. On top of all that, we also got a look at the key visual for the anime, which can be seen below: The animated project will be based on Junji Ito's eleven-volume "Masterpiece Collection" and his "Fragments of Horror" manga. It has not been made clear which stories in particular will be getting the anime treatment, but we're sure you can guess which fan favorites will likely get some screen time. Within the website, you'll also find comments from both Junji Ito and Shinobu Tagashira where they talk about their excitement for the upcoming series. It was stated by Junji Ito that having his own anime series had been a long time dream of his, and that he's extremely pleased with everything he has seen so far in terms of the anime adaptation of his work.

It'll be available in four colorways, and will be sold at Oplant's both during day three of Summer Comiket this weekend. You can check out a preview of the shirt below: Alongside the release of this adorable t-shirt is a legitimate testimony to PARK's dedication to independent artists; if you're not familiar with their doujin magazine CO;RYU, let me introduce you. CO;RYU is a Japanese-language magazine that exists with the unique goal of bridging smaller artists to a wider audience through small-form interviews and discussions. Its name itself actually holds a significant amount of meaning to its purpose, with the "Co" bringing forward the ideology of collaboration, and "Coryu" itself actually giving off the meaning of exchange in Japanese. Their latest volume is set to also be available at the Oplant booth on day three of Summer Comiket, and will include a whole bunch of exclusive goodies, with a heavy focus on the upcoming "URAHARA" anime series. You'll also be able to get your hands on an incredible original illustration book by Tanaka Mugi, which showcases a massive collection of her illustrations from between 2011 ~ 2017.

Following the lives of not-so-average 14-year old girls Popuko and Papimi, we're taken on a series of fourth wall-breaking adventures that pretty much defy anything I've ever read before, and that's only one of the reasons I love the series so much. When it comes to outtakes and opinions on the Japanese anime and manga industry, there is nobody that nails the cliche's better than Bkub Okawa. It's through his hyper-surreal 4-panel series "Pop Team Epic" that we see the industry and its key figures hillariously lampooned in ways never done before, let alone by a published manga series. But that's what makes the series so great -- it's not afraid to break boundaries in new and hilarious ways, while also remaining critical of its own actions and progress. I'm sure its grown larger than even Bkub could have imagined, and that's all part of the fun, demanding that the series stay on top of its game at all times. What the third season has to offer remains to be seen, but we're more than excited to see what comes next. There's currently no official English translation for the series, but I'm sure you've seen Enlgish snippets jammed in your social media aplenty. Are you excited for the third season?

11677|2017-08-08|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/shake-the-block-report/| News | Music | Looking Back on the First Monthly 'Shake the Block' Event | After combining electronic music and milkshakes, we take a look back at the first ever 'Shake the Block' event which took place here in Tokyo, Japan. |Tokyo is a city that is constantly trying to reinvent itself; through the constant construction of new highrises, all the way to the limited-time pop-up stores and events that litter the streets. There's a handful of these changes that bide well with the general public, but a majority tends to fall over before it can truly realize its full potential. With the way things operate however, it can be something as simple as the pairing of eclectic club-focused sounds with a delictious milkshake and hamburger set that truly wins people over. It took a while for this combination to be cracked, but it's thanks to "Shake the Block" that this pairing could truly be recognized. Both within and outside the constraints of work, I'm always attending various events around the Tokyo-area. It's through this constant slew of events that I've been able to experience a wide variety of different approaches to what makes a party truly great. Ultimately, it turns out all you need is milkshakes on tap and a solid lineup of incredible DJ's, and you're pretty much set for the night. Without beating around the bush too much, what I'm referencing is the recent "Shake the Block" event that was thrown in collaboration between both block.fm and Shake Shack Japan to create a new monthly community-driven event that pretty much offers exactly what I've just detailed, shakes and music. It's difficult to measure a new monthly event's success by its first show, but if a completely packed Shake Shack is anything to go by, I would dare suggest it went well. Calling on the talents of DJ's Taku Takahashi, MARZY, Jayda B. and Keisuke Matsuoka, we witnessed what could possibly be the birth of a new community before our eyes, though we'll of course have to see how these next few months continue. It wasn't really like a club event, but at the same time it wasn't quite like a casual dining experience -- it really contained a unique vibe of its own. Where the event will go from here on out remains to be seen, but I know I hold a lot of excitement for the potential it holds. What was a legitimately enjoyable night could easily become a simple monthly routine, and I wouldn't have a problem with it at all. If the event can continue to evolve and present new experiences, I see it being a long-running Tokyo mainstay that people from all over will bea ble to enjoy. If you're interested in checking "Shake the Block" out, it takes place on the first Saturday of every month, and is located at the Shake Shack Meiji Jingu Gaien store. What's your thoughts, milkshakes and electronic music sound like your kind of night?|block.fm, Shake Shack, Shake the Block, taku takahashi, Azamarzy

In a recent announcement from Kodansha, we got our first look at the upcoming OVA adaptation of the "Attack on Titan: Lost Girls" visual novel and manga series. The anime will be split up into three different OVA episodes, and will closely follow the story of Mikasa Ackerman and Annie Leonheart throughout their adventures. Set to ship alongside limited-edition copies of the manga series, we'll be able to get our hands on the first episode December 8, 2017, with the second and third episodes releasing on April 9, 2018 and August 9, 2018 respectively. Originally released by Nitroplus in 2013, the visual novel would go on to receive its own novel and manga series years after initial release. With the nature of the OVA release, it remains to be seen just if it will ever see the light of day for international audiences. Little information is known about the actual production of the series outside of this, but we're sure there will be more announcements in the coming months. What are your thoughts?

11661|2017-08-07|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/evangelion-new-eva/| News | Anime | Hideaki Anno May Have Just Given us a Peek at New Eva Design | Hideaki Anno may be teasing us with a new design, and the source is definitely unique! |Can you believe that it has already been a full five years since the premiere of the third Rebuild of Evangelion movie? As these last few years have trudged slowly by, doubt had started to creep in. Was Hideaki Anno actually actively interested in concluding the story that he had spun anew? Fans knew of the director's complicated relationship with the series, and honestly, it didn't seem so far removed from the realm of possibility that he would keep us all in the lurch with that roller coaster of a third film. We saw him take on other work, such as directing 2016's live action Shin Godzilla, and we got a little anxious. Thankfully, beginning earlier this year, it slowly became apparent that the fourth film was indeed in production at Studio Khara, and the time for teasing has reared its playfully infuriating head. We can't stay too mad though, because our beloved director sure has quite the whimiscal ways of keeping us all on the edges of our seat. Almost every year, Anno and his family participate in the Kamakura Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine Bonbori festival, wherein paper lanterns are decorated lovingly by the attendees. Anno has used this opportunity to reveal new hints and designs for the film series in the past, and the tradition remains strong even now. Anno has made a dramatic returned to the Bonbori festival, this time with a brand-new teaser lantern in tow. Unmistakably, it shows Eva Unit 02's new form as "Shin Nigouki," and the film's official moniker is scrawled at the bottom. It would appear now that Asuka's bio-mechanical partner has seen the most revisons out of any Eva unit, and it does seem apparent that Anno has a thing for teasing us with anything related to the crimson giant. Whatever happens, we can be assured that Asuka will likely have an even larger role to play in this final chapter of the revered mecha series. I've written at length about the latest developments in the Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 saga, with the most recent bits of speculation being about just how these films fit into the grand scheme and timeline of the human instrumentality project.

This has been a thought that I've been processing a lot lately, especially with a wide variety of news coming to light lately. Thankfully however, I'm happy to report that this goodbye is not of the lasting variety. Moga Mogami, the purple member of the electrically-charged Akihabara idol group Denpagumi.inc has announced her official departure from the unit. Though we may no longer see the self-proclaimed online gaming otaku grace the floorboards of Dear Stage with her fleet steps, it is very likely that we'll soon be treated to the very first bits of her much longed-after solo career. Moga wrote a blog post detailing her decision to leave the group. Within the post, she cites difficulties in continuing with the group, as her personal ambitions did not always perfectly align. Therefore, in order not to cause any static within Denpagumi.inc and in order to pursue her own ambitions as a solo artist, she decided that now would be the best time to part ways. Five members of Dempagumi.inc remain -- Mirin Furukawa, Risa Aizawa, Eimi Naruse, Ayane Fujisaki, and Yumemi Nemu. It's been stated that they will continue group activities as a five-person idol unit for the time being. Thank you, Moga, for everything you have done for fans of Denpagumi.inc, idol culture, and and music in general. I know I'm looking forward to cheering you on well into the next stage!

11650|2017-08-07|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/satoshi-kon-award/| News | Anime | Stunning Post-Apocalyptic 'COCOLORS' Wins Satoshi Kon Award | This anime short, inspired heavily by Japanese printmaking, is the latest anime film to receive the coveted award inspired by a master. |From Perfect Blue to Paprika, the late Satoshi Kon helmed some of the most beautiful and profoundly-mesmerizing animated films of the 21st century. In order to honor his legacy, the Montreal Fantasia Film Festival has established an award in their animation category -- Axis: The Satoshi Kon Award for Excellence in Animation. This year, the award was won by Toshihisa Yokoshima's short film COCOLORS, the title itself being a play on the Japanese word "kokoro" for heart, and the English "colors." You can check out the trailer below for the eerily beautiful post-apocalyptic short film below, which is being offered subtitled in multiple languages including English: Yokoshima directed this work at animation studio Kamikaze Douga, who in addition to producing these films as part of the "Gasoline Mask" project, have assisted primarily with animation found within video games, like Soul Sacrifice Delta. The studio describes the film as such: There is a world in which an endless rain of dark ash fills the sky, and covers the earth. Humanity, fearing the ash that burns and melts away human flesh, had no choice but to cover themselves in protective suits, and their faces with gigantic masks. Bundled up in their suits and hidden away behind their masks, the people have fled deep within the underground. This is the story of the children growing up in this fearful world, this is "COCOLORS". Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the film is the animation style itself, which is heavily inspired by Japanese woodblock printmaking. Even though the setting of the film is alien to all of us -- an underground, miserable hellscape -- all of the colors that we are able to see manage to pop out and make quite the dramatic impression. Kamikaze Douga have also shared a little bit of the though behind that genius, firmly cementing just as to why they were able to clinch this coveted award. From ancient times IRO(色), the Japanese word for color, has been used to express a variety of things, usually pertaining to tone.顔色 - KAO(face)-IRO-- Tone of face, or Facial expressions. 声色 - KOWA(voice)-IRO -- Tone of voice. 音色 - NE(sound)-IRO -- Tone or quality of sound.These are a few of the many ways IRO can be used in the Japanese language. However in the world of COCOLORS, the characters' faces are hidden and their voices are distorted by the masks they must wear. Because of the masks, their IRO, or colors, are left to the imagination. She may be skipping to hide her sadness. His anger might be a pretense to further hide his crying face. In a world covered in dark ash, each of the characters' IRO are carved in stroke by stroke, layer by layer, much like a traditional Japanese wood print. Those colors will be printed in full display in the animated movie "COCOLORS" If you are interested in learning more about the process behind the film, you'll find many informative "making of" gif clips detailing things like the film's background art and the making of the 3D characters on the official website, here. All that's left to do now is hope and pray that all of us non-festival goers can peek a widespread release of the film soon.|COCOLORS, Satoshi Kon, Film Festival, Film, Toshihisa Yokoshima

It's become more and more apparent as of late that there's a merger happening between the worlds of fashion and anime subculture all around the world. For various reasons, there's a large amount of inspiration being shared between each subculture, and over the years its produced some pretty incredible results. When it comes to anime, there are few with a more counter-culture stance than that of Eureka Seven; which inevitably makes it the perfect match for such an anti-establishment movement such as the one street fashion presents. That makes it fitting of course that ahead of the upcoming Eureka Seven film, we'd see some an entire lineup of street-ready goods. Collaborating closely with the team at UNGREEPER, as well as artist TAKUMI, we're offered a gorgeous collection of Ukiyo-e style Eureka Seven clothing pieces and goods. You'll have a few more chances to pick up some of the pieces in the coming days. Check out the full gallery below: Interested in picking up some of these pieces up? You'll wanna be quick.

11620|2017-08-03|20:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/game-paradise/| News | Games | 'Game Tengoku' Revival Promises to be a Retro Anime Romp | The Game Paradise! CruisinMix aims to bring one of the Sega Saturn's cult hits to a whole new audience. |If you were to ask me about a game franchise that I would like to see revived, I'd pull out a laundry list of titles headed-up with F-Zero, and perhaps rounded-off with a real Banjoo-Kazooie experience. If you were to ask the internet at large (at least my special circle of it), then you'd likely receive the resounding echo of "Chronoooooooo" from the combined shouts of thousands of starved RPG players. However, if your dream revival was an obscure Sega Saturn arcade shooter overloaded with anime hijinks that never actually released outside of Japan, and if said shooter happened to be called Game Tengoku, then boy have I got some good news for you. When Kadokawa Games announced that their remake titled Game Tengoku: Cruisin Mix was making the move outside of Japan, I knew that it was my official calling to get the word out. Cruisin Mix is a faithful port of an arcade-style shooting game with a distinctly 90s anime style, which tasks you with blasting baddies in a few rather unorthodox locations. Why shoot up aliens in space like a normal galactic craft when you can just do so on the floor of the arcade itself? Welcome to "Arcade World"! Don't forget to visit the "Karaoke World" as well, where you'll be shooting down song lyrics as they leave Misato's mic... really! I'll let the official word from Kadokawa Games explain the madness a little: Following the hit arcade title released in 1995, Game Tengoku hit the Sega Saturn in 1997. It featured classic Jaleco characters mixed in with all-new original characters voiced by a number of popular voice actors, and was a character-based shoot ‘em up that was well ahead of its time! It also featured characters designed by famous manga artist Tatsuya Souma, plus fully-voiced skits, 4 original songs, and animations! All while making other shooting games jealous of how well it pulled off its game mechanics! It managed to be a character centric game without succumbing to any of the cut corners that usually come with such a title. To this very day countless fans still call for a remade port of this title! The self-proclaimed “Super Duper Genius Smart Guy” Yamada has plan to take over the gaming world, and sets his sights first on the world of video games by taking control of all the arcade cabinets at the “You&Me Kamiyoga” arcade in Kamiyoga, Tokyo! But part-time arcade employee Yui Ito is ready to take him on! Determined to put an end to this before the arcade opens, she hastily hacks together all the used arcade circuit boards she has lying around and calls upon all the main characters to take down this evil genius! The game is set for release in Japan for the PlayStation 4 and PC during Winter of this year. The physical version of the game will come bundled with a DVD containing both the original anime OVA that fleshed out the story a bit, and interviews with all the voice actors involved with the game. In a world where it's practically guaranteed we won't see a new project with this aesthetic direction ever again, this is a welcome treat for fans of retro-cool from the late 90s. So what do you think? Will you be picking the game up? If you are interested in learning more about the crazy characters and worlds, then I would advise checking out the official site here -- it's even fully translated into English. Finally, I'll leave you now with a pair of gorgeous posters made for the game's original Saturn release. |Sega, The Game Paradise: CruisinMix, Retro, Gaming, Video Games

Coming all the way from Kyoto to Tokyo, her infectious Gameboy-driven music and performances have captivated an entire audience, both domestically and internationally. With numerous indie releases, as well as a plethora of international shows under her belt, the time is seemingly perfect for a major label like Toy's Factory Japan to swoop in and pick her up as a talent. Announced today, Toriena has officially signed to Toy's Factory Japan, joining the ranks of fellow musicians such as Pa's Lam System, SEKAI NO OWARI, starRo, and numerous others. Alongside the announcement was word of her five-track major debut EP, "MELANCOZMO", which is set to release digitally August 21 here in Japan. We're beyond excited, and the EP description has gone on to state that the album will supposedly be the perfect representation of Toriena as an individual. The album's tracklist can be found below: 1.PRESS START 2.NOT IDOL 3.来来点心 4.プロサウンドの逆襲 5.MELANCOZMO The only thing left to do now is wait and see how the world reacts to the upcoming chiptune invasion that is upon them. With the growth of Toriena over the last few years, it's only a matter of time before we see more and more talent develop an interest for the musical genre. If you're interested in checking out further information, as well as preordering the EP, be sure to check out the official website, here. Best of luck, Toriena!

Until now, the company has been content with simply licensing anime for streaming outside of Japan, but have declared interest in actually having a hand in the production and funding of shows. Last year, they announced Perfect Bones by Production I.G, but it has yet to see the light of day. Depending on when that show actually comes to our screens, it could be running neck-and-neck with the company's latest announcement. At their "Netflix Anime Slate 2017" event today, A.I.C.O. -Incarnation-, a totally new and original work by Studio Bones and director Kazuya Murata, who has previously worked on the likes of Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos and Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet. The plan is to release the anime simultaneously worldwide in Spring of 2018, and as far as we can tell, that means Japan too. It's all about that binging culture here! With the heavy focus on a worldwide release, it's no surprise that the company has also released a long-form preview for the show in English. Be sure to check it out below! Netflix has provided an official synopsis of the series: In Japan in the year 2035, an accident known as the "Burst" occurs during a research project, spawning an out-of-control artificial life form called "Matter" that has spread throughout the Kurobe Gorge. The research city that was once hailed as the hope for humanity is cordoned off by the government. Two years later, 15-year-old Aiko Tachibana, who lost her family in the Burst, learns something unbelievable from Yuya Kanzaki, a new student at her school. A secret is hidden within her body, and the answer to the puzzle lies at the "Primary Point" that was the center of the Burst. Aiko resolves to infiltrate the restricted area, escorted by a team of divers and with Yuya as her guide. When boy meets girl with the fate of humanity in their hands, what new truth will come to light? From the preview video, it certainly looks like we can expect a gorgeously-produced sci-fi romp. It will most likely be a smash-hit for Netflix from the very day it premieres, as I've seen positive reactions from audiences all around the world already. Love it or hate it, Netflix's anime release tactics are certainly causing a stir in the current streaming playing field, and you can be assured that I'll be monitoring the situation closely.|A.I.C.O. -Incarnation-, Netflix, Studio Bones, Kazuya Murata

Persona games before the 5th mainline entry. Looking beyond just the seemingly endless spinoff content that was derived from Persona 4, series creator Atlus certainly knows how to celebrate their past work, and rightfully so. The Persona games are of a different pedigree to other games -- their stories seemingly living on with you forever. So the biggest celebration of such a monumentous series, "Persona Super Live P-Sound Bomb!!!! 2017," certainly would be the best place to celebrate such achievements, as well as new content of course. Not only can we expect two new entries into the "Persona: Dancing!!" series, but also a second entry into the series' grand crossover project, "Persona Q". Announced during the concert for the Nintendo 3DS, "Persona Q2" will be coming soon. Images from the original "Persona Q" release for Nintendo 3DS. The teaser image for the game makes suggestion that we'll be seeing the fresh faces of the "Persona 5" universe within the game, and one could only dream that we'd see cast members from the original two games included as well. The original Persona Q is a dungeon-crawling game, similar in style to Atlus' own Etrian Odyssey series. It tasks you with drawing your own map of the dungeons you are exploring, and is known for their fairly hardcore difficulty. The Personified version featured a unique story and the stylish flair the rest of the series is so well-known for.

It's been long rumored that Persona 3 would receive a spinoff title akin to "Persona 4: Dancing All Night," though there had been little speculation of "Persona 5" also receiving a spinoff this early. Both games are expected to release in Japan during spring 2018. There are very few games I hold in higher regards than "Persona 4: Dancing All Night," and that's an honest truth. I remember sitting down for hours on end playing that game to pieces, with the game's remixed soundtrack going on to define much of my favorite video game-related musical memories. The 2015 released PlayStation Vita exclusive title will find much of its lead staff working on the upcoming pair of releases, which only adds to the physical and emotional excitement for this game. Whilst little information is currently known about the upcoming games -- including who will be helming remixes and what direction the story will take -- Atlus have shared a trailer for both releases, as well as launching an official website for the PlayStation exclusive titles. Persona 3: Dancing Moon Light Persona 5: Dancing Star Night With so many unanswered questions and excitement leading up to the games, we can't help but be excited for the next big information drop. Though it may not be the Persona 5 for the PlayStation Vita that many people wanted, I'm beyond glad that it is making its way on to the portable console. What are your thoughts? Are you ready for more dancing action?

It was through these studios that the service would go on to receive some pretty hefty exclusives, including the Gundam series. Within the press release, it was detailed just how the ACJ plans to phase out the service, and how this will affect current users: [Schedule Leading Up to the Closure of DAISUKI] (All times listed are in Japan Standard Time) July 1, 2017 – 12:00 a.m. New registration for DAISUKI’s premium membership service was closed. August 31, 2017 – 11:00 a.m. Sale of rentable content will be stopped. September 29, 2017 – 4:00 p.m. DAISUKI NEXT will end all service. October 2, 2017 – 11:00 a.m. The DAISUKI app (iOS/Android) will no longer be available for download. October 31, 2017 – 11:00 a.m. All DAISUKI services (excluding free Dragon Ball Super simulcasting) will be terminated. December 15, 2017 – 6:00 p.m. All DAISUKI social networking service accounts (Twitter, Facebook) and customer support will be closed. The service ended subscription services July 1, 2017, with all members who were subscribed prior to this receiving free premium until the service is terminated. It has also been detailed that "Dragon Ball Super" will continue to be available for free simulcasting, though it remains to be seen how this will be handled. Though little information has been revealed about the termination, it comes at an interesting time with both Netflix and Amazon weighing in heavily on the anime streaming industry.

11619|2017-08-01|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/funimation-sony-acquisition/| News | Anime | Sony Pictures TV to Acquire Funimation for $150 Million | Sony Pictures Television have acquired a majority stake in American anime publisher Funimation, purchased at just below $150 million. |When it comes to anime in the West, things have certainly been getting a little bigger over the years. From the widespread success of films such as "Your Name.", all the way to series' such as Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia, anime certainly isn't the niche culture it was some 15 years ago. If we were to put a price on anime in the West? Well, it'd probably look something like the $143 million, 95% acquisition of anime distributor Funimation that Sony Pictures Television is currently undertaking. It's a pretty massive move, and undoubtedly is going to send a few shockwaves throughout the global anime community. Along with the acquisition of Funimation comes titles such as "Dragon Ball Z," "Cowboy Bebop," "One Piece," "My Hero Academia," "Attack on Titan," and the 2016 smash-hit "Your Name". That's by no means a small deal. With some of the most popular anime of all time in their hands, only time can tell just what changes we may see in the coming years through this acquisition. Gen Fukunaga, founder and CEO of Funimation will maintain his role within the company. There's over 10,000 hours worth of content in the hands of Funimation, with some 450 series to their name, and it's fair to say this number will quite rapidly grow in the coming years. If there was ever a time for Sony Pictures Television to make this move, that time is definitely now. With anime being more accessible now than ever before through streaming services such as Funimation Now and partner Crunchyroll, more and more individuals are tuning in to the each seasons offerings. I'm excited to see what comes of such a large deal, and hope for a lasting benificial bonus to the industry we all love so much. What are your thoughts on the acquisition? We're hoping for all the best, especially with the winning streak Funimation has been on lately. |Funimation, sony, Sony Pictures Television, Cowboy Bebop, Your Name, Dragon Ball, My Hero Academia, Attack on Titan, One piece, Acquisition

Nothing however, leaves room for greater question than one of "Fate/Grand Order Fes'" major attractions, but you know what? We love every single moment of it. In what may be one of the greatest tutorial sequences ever conceived, "Fate/Grand Order" is accompanied by a set of short comics known as "Understand FGO Through Manga!", illustrated by artist リヨ (Riyo). Making an appearance throughout the short manga panels are super-adorable versions of the game's main characters and servants, who inevitably get caught up in some pretty over-the-top hijinks and antics along the way. The manga's version of the game's female protagonist, lovingly christened "Gudako," is especially popular. Imagine the sheer joy then, if you will, of con-goers who arrived at this celebration of all things "Fate/Grand Order" to find costumed versions of the manga's depictions of Gudako, Mash, and Saber Artoria. ゆるいwwwwwwww pic.twitter.com/26vE8iSOlM — whitenoize (@whitenoize) July 29, 2017 This is truly next level... cosplay?

What may come as a bit of a surprise however, is fans can also expect to see the titles on the Nintendo Switch, albeit at a later date than the other consoles with a late 2017 timeframe. Capcom released a trailer on their YouTube channel which can be streamed below: Originally released on 3DS back in 2012, the game featured characters Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield as they fought for survival upon the abandoned Queen Zanobia cruise ship. Featuring a story written by OTAQUEST co-founder Dai Sato, players were taken away on an adventure that was obviously well enough received to warrant HD remasters and releases on what feels like almost every console to ever exist. Though, we're not complaining at all. The release will run at 1920x1080 resolution, and will supposedly operate at "higher frame-rates". Perhaps if I can finally get my hands on a Switch, this might just be a day one purchase, with late 2017 being my guess for when I'll finally stumble across one. For further information on the upcoming release, be sure to head over to Capcom's official blog, where they've gone ahead and shared a bit about the story and what players can expect to get themselves into.

You may recall that a stunning example of this was actually Japan's biggest animated film in quite a number of years, your name. It received its debut screening at Anime Expo 2016, a full seven weeks before it debuted in Japanese theaters on August 26, 2016. Not to let themselves be outdone, this past year Anime Expo played host to the very first screening of Kyoto Animation's hotly-anticipated Violet Evergarden TV series, which isn't set to go on-air until clear into next year -- January to be precise. It seems now that another con wants a slice of the premiere action, as Washington D.C.'s Otakon has announced that they will be host to the first showing of the much-hyped (especially around these parts) first chapter of the Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution trilogy of movies. You won't simply be catching the film, either. As may be expected for such an occasion, a very important person will come along for the show. You'll be able to rub shoulders with Tomoki Kyoda, the chief director of the project. If you're interested in attending, then you'll want to make your way over to the Marquis Ballroom on August 12, from 6:30 to 8:30 pm. This film is scheduled to open in theaters across Japan on September 16, with parts two and three scheduled for 2018 and 2019 respectively. If you would like to take an even further in-depth look behind the scenes, we actually had the chance to ask scriptwriter Dai Sato some questions about the project.

It wasn't so much a question of if, but simply a question of when and how. The answer to those very questions may have been answered, or at least to some degree, and there's a whole lot of excitement surrounding it all. Before we even begin talking details about the upcoming title, check out the official trailer for the game below: Okay, so now that you've got that out of the way -- Wow. Here's a few pieces of infromation we're able to pull from the trailer; the game will be a collaborative project between the "Fate Grand/Order" entity and SEGA. On top of this, it's set to release at some point in 2018 and will feature 3D visuals. It'll be a team-battle game, and is currently set to be a Japan exclusive for the moment, with no word of a Western release any time soon. Based on the smartphone title "Fate/Grand Order", you'll find a familiar set of faces within the slightly-above two minute trailer.

Cafe Tour Bus Here in Tokyo | There's an all-new tour bus operating here in Tokyo that will take you to all the local destinations from Makoto Shinkai's Your Name. |It's been a little over a year since Makoto Shinkai's global smash-hit film "Your Name." sent legitimate shockwaves throughout the anime community and beyond, can you believe it? Receiving it's world debut at Anime Expo 2016 in Los Angeles, USA, the film rapidly went on to break all kinds of records for both anime and animated movies in general, including topping all domestic records held by Studio Ghibli in ticket sales, save only for Spirited Away. It makes sense of course then, that it wouldn't take long for the Japanese government to step in to capitalize on this phenomenon, and that's exactly what we took part in recently. You might remember about a week ago we wrote up a piece on the upcoming "Your Name. Cafe Bus in Tokyo" that would be operating August 3 through September 29 of this year.

Operating for an hour and a half, you're treated to delicious delicacies from the film, all whilst being shown the various locale in which the film was largely based. Be sure to scroll through our gallery of the experience below! You'll be going throughout the world-famous Shinjuku, all whilst your tour guide informs just what you're looking at in both Japanese and English. Throughout your 90 minutes on the bus, everyone will be given a gorgeous pancake dish, a croquette bun, and an iced latte, all themed after various meals and scenes in the movie. Part of the Cool Japan initiative, and operated in collaboration with WILLER, the whole trip was a lasting amount of fun for everyone involved. Priced at 5,800 yen per adult (roughly $53 USD), all tickets will include the full food and drink course set.

On July 28 in Japan, the official website for the films was updated to display a never-before-seen animation image board illustrated by Tatsuya Kishida on the film's staff. The translation is pretty vague, but reads something like "The continuation and the end. The error, and the antithesis." "Shin Evangelion Gekijōban :|| currently in production." There is no mention of the previously held name of the movie, which was for a time Evangelion: 3.0+1.0, though that doesn't necessarily mean that the moniker is gone for good, as these films have been known to go by multiple names. As for what the text on the poster means, I've been seeing a lot of wild bits of specualtion. As for the film being both the "continuation and the end," it could mean that it is indeed the final chapter in the Evangelion saga. Though, what if the end part actually refers to 1997's The End of Evangelion film that Anno orignally intended to be the conclusion of the series while back at Gainax. I've had quite a few debates with Eva-loving friends over the years to the tune of the Rebuild films not actually being an alternate-retelling as is commonly thought, but a whole slew of separate events taking place after the infamous events of End. It's some truly mysterious stuff, even if I'm way off-base on this. As for the the "error and antithesis" -- will a certain tragic hero finally be redeemed? Will this giant robot symphony epic actually have a mirthful conclusion? Only time will tell.|Neon Genesis Evangelion, Shin Evangelion, Rebuild of Evangelion, Studio Khara, Hideaki Anno

And it's a Square Enix RPG series, no less! I'm not talking Final Fantasy nor Star Ocean, but a perhaps little-known franchise called Dragon Quest. The first entry into the series, released on the NES, hit international markets under the name Dragon Warrior, which looking back on it seems like an obscure and unnecessary name change. Moving forward however, it wouldn't be until 2008 with the PlayStation 2 release of Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King that the world truly got a taste of the series. Though it's never seen the sales lustre of the more popular Square Enix title, Final Fantasy, in it's home country it's been a major staple of both gaming and wider media. Apart from some Warriors-esque sinoff titles, Dragon Quest Heroes I & II, the West has largely been left in the dark when it comes to the newer mainline releases, until now that is.

Based on the subtitles offered by the YouTube version of the video, we can imagine that the game will also receive a French, German, Italian, and Spanish translation. As far as a release date goes, the only hint we get at the moment is sometime in 2018. Currently, both a PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 3DS version of the title exist, although a Nintendo Switch version is heavily-rumored albeit still unannounced.

11587|2017-07-28|22:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/sayo-yamamoto-interview-part-2/| Interview | Anime | Interview With Yuri!!! on ICE Creator Sayo Yamamoto: Part 2 | We sat down with the illustrious Sayo Yamamoto for our two-part interview on her enormous career within the anime industry. |Sayo Yamamoto is, without a doubt, one of the most diversely talented individuals in the Japanese animation industry. She's a woman shrouded in a veil of mystery, cast simply to ensure attention is set on her work, rather than herself as an creator. Set aside a few convention appearances, Sayo Yamamoto has always been one to ensure that her own hard work does all the talking she could ever need to do herself. That's why when the unique opportunity to conduct the first ever English-language interview with Ms. Yamamoto presented itself, there was no way we would turn it down. Even if you're not familiar with Sayo Yamamoto as a person, it's almost certain that you will be familiar with her works. From "Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine" to "Michiko and Hatchin", all the way to her more recent "Yuri!!! on ICE", it would appear that everything Sayo Yamamoto touches is destined for greatness. She started off at the bottom and worked her way to the top, one step at a time. Unafraid to move forward without ever looking back, Ms. Yamamoto is more than just a role model for women, she's a role model for society as a whole. Her signature style would go on to portray women as more than just side characters, but as powerful leaders that could do everything their male counterparts could and so much more. Conducting the interview was Dai Sato -- an individual who is equal parts a collaborator and friend of Sayo Yamamoto's. In the past, the pair worked together on animated treasures such as "Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine", "Samurai Champloo", and "Space Dandy", amongst a diverse list of other titles. The interview had a distinct air to it, feeling more like a discussion between old friends than the nitty-gritty talks between publication and director. Split up into multiple-parts, you can find the second and final part of our interview with Sayo Yamamoto below: -- Sayo Yamamoto, it’s an honor to have you here with us. Before anything else, I’d like to ask what experiences lead to you becoming an anime director?​ When I first entered the industry, I worked as a production manager at Studio Madhouse. That was around the turn of the century. From my very first day working there, I was driven to eventually become a producer. To do that however, I had to start as a production manager. Though, I didn’t really think that the job of production manager suited me very well. Managing schedules and wrangling people was not suited for me at all (laughs). I was thinking that if I had any breaks, I could try out some of the duties of a producer. I kept telling myself “You can do this!” While performing production manager duties, I was also drawing storyboards - I was assisting in producing. -- So what project did you first do storyboarding for? At the request of my art director, Hideyuki Tanaka, I started working on some animations which were used as live visuals at a SMAP concert. The character designer and producer was animator Takeshi Koike. I was put in charge putting the storyboards into clean copy using Tanaka’s directorial notes and memos. Prior to this, I’d never actually storyboarded, yet I somehow manage to learn simply by watching others. Because I went to an art college, I was familiar with programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator. It seemed like everyone at the Studio wanted me to make use of these skills, so I began studying key animation illustration so I could assist in those areas. I worked on Koike’s "TRAVA," "World Record" from "The Animatrix," and "Redline." -- After that, what was your first project as an independent producer? The first story I produced was an OVA called ‘Trava: Fist Planet, episode 1’ for a DVD magazine known as "Grasshoppa!". I was doing storyboarding and producing, but Takeshi Koike was director on top of doing all of the series key animation, there wasn’t much I could actually “produce” (laughs). Koike made most layout timing decisions when he reviewed them, and even when it came time for editing, most of those decisions were left intact. There wasn’t much left for me to do because the degree of completion on those layouts was already very high. -- You continued to have a good relationship with Takeshi Koike after this, and even did some more projects with him, right? That’s right; I took up more jobs at Takeshi Koike’s side. During that first project, I felt like I had seen something quite amazing. Koike truly is a genius. -- Following this, you moved from Studio Madhouse to Studio Manglobe, if I remember correctly? I wanted to continue honing my production ability by getting used to handling television series, but there weren’t many opportunities for me to do so at Madhouse, especially since I was asked to serve as an assistant director on one of their new film projects. If I were to continue being employed at Madhouse, I wouldn’t have much control over my workflow, so I started to consider my options. It was around this time that I first met Watanabe Shinichiro. -- It would seem that you meeting with Watanabe Shinichiro would go on to shape a large portion of your career. What was it that lead to you two first meeting? A fellow animator and acquaintance of mine was working at Madhouse at the time doing key animation for "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door," who was invited to work on "Samurai Champloo." Around the same time Watanabe was looking for someone to fill a production role, where I was introduced shortly after. I believe that was sometime around the Autumn of 2003. I quit Madhouse and switched over to freelancing. As a freelancer, I joined with Studio Manglobe, and participated in "Samurai Champloo" as an episode director. -- After this you would take on many more episode directorial roles, with your first full directorial work being the animated series Michiko and Hatchin. Before that however, I’d like to take a step back and ask about some other things. What anime influenced you, and was there any series in particular that prompted you to begin working towards a job in the industry? There really wasn’t any series in particular that prompted me to work towards the industry. However while I was an art student, there was this Mac program called "Director." It was basically this presentation software that allowed you to animate things in 24 frames per second, which is the same as anime. Around this time I came across some still-shots of "Yojimbo" at school. (laughs) -- Akira Kurosawa’s "Yojimbo"? That’s the one. Especially the scenes in which Toshiro Mifune drew his sword and slashed people. I watched all those scenes and thought they were really cool. I tried drawing and animating the scenes myself in ‘Director’, and that was probably my first real inspiration for working in the anime industry. -- It was quite the coincidence that you would get to work on ‘Samurai Champloo’ then, wasn’t it? Of course, at the time I had no idea that I would ever be doing that. (laughs) Looking back on it, I think that if I had seen pictures from Akira Kurosawa’s other work, "Ikiru," instead of "Yojimbo," I may have never even thought about trying out animation. -- So it was around the time you were in art school that you started to think about working in the anime industry? That’s right. At the time, Japan was undergoing some sort of employment recession, which made things quite difficult. Art school students already didn’t seek employment in traditional ways. If you were a graphic design student, then it would be common for you to join a design company, but for people like illustrators and painters, it’s not common to go job hunting. I was into environmental design, so I was in a similar situation. Many others lost the motivation to continue job hunting and decided to simply start their own businesses. I didn’t have that kind of confidence though. I was under the belief that having no job would be the equivalent to being homeless, and this led me to think that if I didn’t do something with momentum, I’d be stuck in a rut after graduation. However, I also didn’t have any distinct qualities as part of my artistic nature, so I figured I needed to hurry up and join some kind of organization or else I’d be in trouble. -- Since you mentioned your “artistic nature,” I’d like to discuss that briefly. In your directorial works "Michiko and Hatchin" and "LUPIN the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine," the protagonists were women who can, in many ways, be seen as both cool and strong in nature. However in your latest work, "Yuri!!! on ICE," this seems to change completely with the introduction of a mostly-male cast; and while there are some strong-willed women involved in the anime, the show still largely revolves around their male counterparts. To me, this seems to be your biggest artistic change. Would you mind explaining the reason behind that? For me, my artistic nature and the gender of my protagonists have no relation. In the case of Michiko, it was more the president (of Manglobe) saying that he wanted to do an action-battle show with a female protagonist. Since I had worked with Koike in the past, I suspect that I was seen as having a knack for a more “American Comics” style... Of course, in terms of my work, I can more or less tackle drawing (the depiction of) women, but really I had no strong interest to do so (laughs). I think I was sometimes also seen as being skilled at drawing woman because I was a woman myself. But if you do watch my works, you’ll realize that I haven’t drawn women all that much! Requests for specific character traits like “lovers” or “family” are just that -- requests. Sometimes, I feel that to be a bit stifling. I like to depict whomever I please, regardless of age, race, and gender. With “Yuri!!!”, I was able to depict relationships and bonds without creative influence from others. This time, I wanted to create an impactful depiction of Men’s singles in figure skating in anime form! It wasn’t so much a matter of “I’m definitely going to draw men this time.” I had a love for figure skating that could not be suppressed, and since I did not have any orders from above, I planned the project with an attitude rather of “I’m definitely going to draw figure skating this time!” -- The Japanese anime industry is often considered to be a place where women don’t really have the opportunity to flourish. Do you think that bias exists, even now?​ It was true that there were few women on production staff in the industry. When I was first looking for work, it was like that as well. And because there were few women on production staff, it was the men who moved up from those roles to become general producers and directors. But even in the past, I don’t think there was any huge split in the number of male and female animators. -- Do you think this is changing? I think so. I’m currently working at MAPPA, and most of the people who come on to projects are women. -- What do you think changed? Although I’m not really interested in defining people in rigid terms of two genders… I feel like girls are more likely to get the job these days. That’s really all there is to it. (laughs) There’s a lot of diligent women, and there’s a lot of men who drift around a little too much. Perhaps men have gotten used to an easygoing lifestyle -- but that’s just life. I think it’s just because they can continue doing what they love at work their whole lives. Women on the other hand; they get married, have kids --these are critical junctures that place a limit on what they can do throughout their lives, and they realize that they don’t have time to rest on their laurels as much. As soon as you realize that, it’s difficult to live that easygoing lifestyle. Before I originally began looking for a job, I knew an assistant stylist who was in her 50’s. She once told me that “idiocy is only forgiven until age 26.” And “If you only do as well as a man, you’ll never be recognized.” She probably lived quite a tough life to have said that. She originally started working in the 70’s, and I felt a really persuasive tone from her. It really got me thinking about a lot of things. -- She must have lived through a much crueler time, right? I agree. That’s why I ended up leaving Studio Madhouse when I was 26 years old. I believed that I had to become a producer on my own, and it was at this time I became involved in the aforementioned "Samurai Champloo." -- Not only women, but now more and more foreigners are getting involved in Japanese animation. Do you think the industry will accept such changes in the future? I think that it’s best that we embrace this. I don’t think there is any difference between Japanese and non, besides our nationality. If one has a vision of what they want to create, then as an industry, it’s best for us to work together. If you are motivated, then I urge anyone to get involved in the industry regardless of race. -- Going back to your first directorial work, "Michiko and Hatchin," what aspects of your workflow and planning have changed significantly leading up to your more recent works? ​ The director creates while imagining what they want to make. The director can embody the image of the project while sharing what they can say "is the most interesting" with their staff... as I had imagined. It is completely different. -- As you mentioned earlier, you were a young lady working to manage on your own in the animation industry, which meant your first work was a turning point. Yes, and even though I don’t like to place a whole lot of focus on my being a woman, of course being tasked with directing was a huge turning point. -- Are there ever times that you look back on your previous works? I don’t do that at all, actually. (laughs) When you start to look back on previous works, doesn’t it all become a bit scary? I start to think “Aren’t I going to die soon?” thinking about the years passed since. I feel like when I’m working on something, I’ve already checked it to death in the process. I always work to the absolute best of my ability on everything, so I really don’t need to look back on it anymore. (laughs) This became especially apparent when I became a director and began creating plots myself. When those plots became screenplays, I checked them. Even when someone else created the storyboards, I was always checking them. I’ve seen it all so much (laughs). So I always give priority to making new things. And now, even though I am working on the theatrical version of "Yuri!!!", my head is pretty occupied with the current figure skating season too. The Olympics only come once every 4 years!!! An exemplatory talent well beyond her years, Sayo Yamamoto is without a doubt an individual who was born to make history. Through her progressive mindset, we're offered a peak into the innerworkings of the anime industry, that only she could offer. It was shared yesterday that her animated series "Michiko & Hatchin" is also now available on Crunchyroll, which is excellent news. With the anticipation leading into the Yuri!!! on ICE film reaching it's peak, we couldn't be more excited to share the second and final part of our interview with Sayo Yamamoto with everyone.

From the lively panels all the way to the enormous entertainment halls, there are very few events that I hold as closely as Attack the Music's debut North America label showcase party, conXion, which took over this years AX Dance. It was an incredible night that aimed to bring together an illustrious roster of talent from both North America and Japan and blending them together into a single dance party. Of course, we were right there in the middle of the action, just so you can live the night over and over again. What conXion did was so much more than just provide a great night for everyone involved, it completely raised the bar for all future events happening at conventions all across the country. Walking the halls, I couldn't count how many times I heard people at a loss of words for just how wild it sounded from the distance, with many still in disbelief as to how good the event actually turned out. We're more than excited to see just what Attack the Music has in store for next year, and look forward to witnessing history being made in the moment once more.

While the former may have it's negative side-effects (hair loss, for one), the latter has proven to be nothing but positive. From One-Punch Man to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and even series like Naruto: Shippuuden and Gurren Lagann, Shingo Natsume has played an important role in them all. So when the opportunity arose to personally sit down with Natsume himself, it wasn't something we were going to turn down. In part four of our video interview series, Shingo Natsume discusses how he shaped One-Punch man with an international audience in mind, following on from his previous work on the Space Dandy series. Looking to international audiences for inspiration, Shingo Natsume got to work on an animated series that he knew would perform well both inside and outside of Japan. Pulling inspiration from his previous works, especially Space Dandy, Shingo recalls moments at foreign conventions where he was amongst the crowds watching his works in real-time. It was from these very moments that he would pick up on what fans enjoyed, as well as what they didn't. It also made him realize another important fact, and that's the fact that foreign fans often enjoy anime the most when watching together, something he wasn't quite used to. With the new-found goal of creating an anime in which people could watch in groups of friends, the very One-Punch Man we have come to know and love was created.

Seemingly without warning, a place I held so dearly was ripped out from under my feet, with absolutely no word of its return. The location I'm talking about of course is my absolute favorite store in all of Japan, Village Vanguard, which closed the doors to its flagship Shibuya location just a few months ago. I didn't see it coming at all, and it was purely by chance that I would stumble into the store that fateful night, only to see everything marked for clearance. But good will always prevail, and it's extremely exciting to share that the store I love so much is back and better than ever. The self-proclaimed 'Exciting Bookstore' graced Japan with its presence in 1998, and has gone on to become a major melting pot of various niche cultures ever since. Offering a little something for everyone, you'll find yourself stumbling between the rows of street fashion, into a section filled to the brim with otaku goods and then tossed out into a field of books. True to its slogan, there really is just something genuinely exciting about this book store, even if it feels like a little bit of a stretch to call it a book store at this point. Operating in an all-new location on the edge of the world-famous Shibuya Crossing, the store's new location is a two-floor utopia of miscellaneous goods and merchandise. There was an overwhelming feeling of relief and excitement when walking through the store's gorgeous new entryway, with it taking little to no time to feel at home again when navigating the store's maze-like layout. The top floor is where you'll find fans of street culture, assorted goods and people who just want to pick up, ahem, some adult products in their dedicated 'Tenga Village' section. A quick walk down the flight of stairs however, and you'll seemingly find yourself somewhere a little more specialized. Greeted by an entire palette of colors lining the walls, the bottom floor is an elaborate mix of new-age internet otaku culture, and I absolutely love it. With entire sections dedicated to idol groups such as Dempagumi.inc and Band Ja Naimon!, you're immediately whisked away into this gorgeous blend of internet and reality. Throwbacks to classic 90's toys such as Furby's line the walls, and at the end of the room is an enormous live stage, adorned by a gorgeous painting from Ai Madonna. Whether it's being used for idol groups, bands, or even live painters, this stage stands as a testament to Village Vanguard's commitment to the various artforms that it works so closely to develop. If you haven't had the opportunity to check out one of Village Vanguard's numerous locations across Japan, the new flagship store is absolutely a place to start. Being one of my favorite locations in Japan, I'm more than glad to share that the Village Vanguard that I knew and loved, is back and better than ever. If you're interested in checking out their new location, you can find it through Google Maps, here. To stay on top of any live events that may be happening, be sure to check out their official Twitter, here.

Whether it's in his programming, or simply the shine off his all-metal robot body that brings people in, there's pretty much one thing that can be guaranteed - you're gonna have a lot of goofy fun. Anime Expo 2017 was a prime example of just that, and showcased just how much fun people can have when one of Japan's most iconic characters gets behind the decks and plays out his unforgettable tribal beats. If you're not at all familiar with DJ Domo, chances are you're missing out big time. From all standpoints, DJ Domo is an extremely lovable character that plays off of the legendary Domo character we all know and love. Acting as one of NHK World's main mascots, as well as the robotic teacher of regular Domo, there's a lot of charm to the playfullness of its stage presence. Throughout the duration of Anime Expo we witnessed numerous breath-taking sets from the legendary DJ Domo in a back-to-back format with the globally-known Taku Takahashi. From the OTAQUEST booth, all the way to the electric Neon District main stage, DJ Domo's pull was far and wide. With audiences generally going wild, it's hard to argue the legitimate fun it was for everyone involved, even if their performances had to take place before their robot batteries ran dry. Where DJ Domo will strike next? Nobody knows. But what we do know for certain is that everyone is going to have a lot of fun, and we can't wait to see it. If you're interested in checking out our previous coverage of DJ Domo from his excitement-filled performance at Anime Central in Chicago, you can find that here.

11554|2017-07-25|16:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/konosuba-new-project/| News | Anime | A New KonoSuba Project is Exploding onto the Scene | I feel like my life hasn't been nearly as exciting since we saw that last of Megumin's explosions. That's about to change. |After witnessing the explosive popularity of KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World both at home here in Japan and abroad, I knew that it wasn't by any stretch of the imagination that a new season, movie -- something -- would be announced for the beloved franchise. Even still knowing all this, when I received this new earlier today, I admittedly exploded into tears of joy. KonoSuba is back in a brand-new animated project, though it is unclear at this moment if that means a season 3, an OVA, or even a movie. Appearing during the 28th episode of KonoSuba Radio on Japan's HiBiKi anime-centric online radio station, voice actor for Kazuma Jun Fukushima and voice actress for Megumin Rie Takahashi joined forces to make the surprise announcement. (If you decide to give it a listen, you'll see that I'm not the only one who exploded into tears after hearing the announcement. How fitting!) Shortly thereafter, the news was further confirmed by the below Tweet from the official KonoSuba account. アニメ新企画、始動！ ラジオで告知させていただきましたが、ファンの皆様の応援のおかげで、アニメ新企画が始動しました！本当に本当にありがとうございます！今後の続報と、このすばキャラたちにまた会える日をお楽しみに！ この素晴らしいファンの皆様に祝福を！ #このすば pic.twitter.com/Rru3URML3A — TVアニメ『このすば』公式ツイッター (@konosubaanime) July 25, 2017 Planning has begun on a new anime project! It was announced on the radio, but thanks to the support of you, all the fans, the new project is underway! Thank you so, so much! Look forward to hearing more soon, and to the day we'll meet the KonoSuba characters again! God's blessing on these wonderful fans! I can positively feel the graciousness radiating from that tweet. And isn't that illustration wonderful? It was provided by artist Mishima Kurone, the character designer of the original light novels. The celebrations came out in full force, as Takahashi uploaded this photo of herself and Fukushima shortly after the broadcast as well. ついに、ついについにみなさまと一緒に喜ぶことが出来る！！！このすばラジオ最終回……からの！！アニメ新企画、始動です！！！！俺たちの戦いは、はじまったばかりだーーー！！！！ #このすば https://t.co/hiklB1Uiaz pic.twitter.com/FLq6ffxI24 — 高橋李依 (@taka8rie) July 25, 2017 I need to get my hands on his shirt. If you haven't given the series a try yet, the anime is a perfect way to start. Rarely have I seen a slapstick comedy that is so on the mark with its timing, as well as taking full advantage of the quirky personalities of its main characters. Yen Press are also currently releasing the light novels in North America, and you can find their official synopsis below. Game loving shut-in Kazuma Sato's life as a young schoolboy in Japan abruptly comes to an early end...or at least it was supposed to. When he opens his eyes, though, he sees a beautiful goddess that offers him a once in an after-lifetime chance to be reborn in a parallel world. The catch is that the world is violent and threatened by a growing evil! Fortunately, he can choose any one thing to bring with him. So he chooses the goddess, Aqua! And so his adventure with his gorgeous companion begins--if he could just get enough money and food to survive, keep his goddess out of trouble, and avoid grabbing the attention of the Demon King's army! If you are a fan of both fantasy RPGs and anime, then you owe it to yourself to give this parody, which never, ever takes itself very seriously, a try.|God's Blessing on this Wonderful World!!, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!!, Light Novel, Explosions, Konosuba, KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World!!
11542|2017-07-25|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/death-note-approval/| News | Anime , Manga | Live-Action Death Note Film Gets Manga Creator's Approval | The upcoming Netflix live-action Death Note film has officially gotten the seal of approval from series creator Tsugumi Ohba during a private screening here in Japan. |Since its very conception, the upcoming Death Note live-action film from Netflix has been shrouded in a thick veil of controversy. From the change to the original Tokyo setting, opting instead for a US-based locale, all the way to the cries of white washing the films cast, we've seen mixed opinions all around. While the bulk majority of the world is yet to lay eyes on the upcoming film, it turns out that two people who actually have had the opportunity are Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, the Death Note manga writer and illustrator respectively. During a private screening here in Japan, Netflix staff and film producers sat down with both Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata to showcase just what they had been working so hard on. Well, apparently they walked away more than pleased with the results of the film, thanking the films staff for their work. Film producer Masi Oka would go on to state at the Death Note private screening during Comic Con that “The greatest moment for me was going to Japan and showing the film to the sensei,” Oka said. “We had a private screening for the sensei, and when the sensei came out and said, ‘Thank you. We love the film,’ it brought a tear to my eye.” The film features a slightly-altered story, loosely revolving around the manga's original characters. Directed by Adam Wingard (Blair Witch), the film casts Nat Wolff as Light Yagami, Keith Stanfield as L, Margaret Qualley as Misa Amane and Willem Dafoe as the voice of Ryuk. The constant within fan opinions is the general excitement surrounding the casting of Willem Dafoe, and it's pretty easy to see why from the trailer above. Set to begin streaming on Netflix August 25, we're inching closer and closer to seeing just how the film will pan out. What are your thoughts on the upcoming film? Are you excited to see it, or is this one a miss?|Death Note, Live-Action, Tsugumi Ohba, Netflix

It's shaping up to be quite the magic-filled bundle of fun. I mean, brand-new animation from Studio Trigger for the cutscenes and a gorgeous in-game style that remains faithful to the charm of the original 2D animation? Games with an anime visage have been looking great recently, but it's not every day you see something so immediately striking. As an action RPG and beat-'em-up hybrid, the game appears to only allow you movement on a 2D plane, though in clever ways that see you also moving towards the background and foreground in this pseudo 2.5D way. It wouldn't be a brawler without some insane power ups and moves, and the trailer confirms they will be there in plenty. Check it out below: A few new witches have been confirmed playable, which is always welcome news. In addition to Akko, Lotte and Sucy, three new girls have been added to the roster, namely Amanda, Constanze and Jasminka. Thank you, Constanze, for confirming giant playable mechs. Along with that glorious display, it puts my mind at ease to know that all of the characters are bringing their A-game when it comes to their quirks and magical abilities. Luckily, Bandai Namco have recently confirmed that they will in fact be localizing the game for Western audiences, so expect to see it in early 2018 for both the PlayStation 4 and PC. They've provided an official synopsis as can be seen below. Having been inspired by a famous witch named Shiny Chariot, an ordinary girl named Atsuko (Akko) Kagari enrolls at Luna Nova Magical Academy, a prestigious school for young girls training to become witches. Before starting summer vacation, Akko and her new classmates find out about an inexplicable phenomenon at Luna Nova caused by the Seven Wonders, which has been passed down for several centuries. Now it's up to Akko as she takes on the adventure to unravel the mystery surrounding the Seven Wonders. |Little Witch Academia, Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time, Bandai Namco, Gaming, Video Games, Studio TRIGGER

11537|2017-07-24|18:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/chuunibyou-movie/| News | Anime | Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions Film Receives Fresh Trailer | Elope to the Ethereal Horizon with Yuuta and Rikka when the film releases early next year! |Ever since it was announced back in May of this year, Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions: Take on Me has been one of my most anticiapted anime projects. Previously, very little was known about the film, as the first trailer merely showed our lovable chunibyo patients falling through the sky with a bit of voiceover for exposition. With the second official trailer, we can glean a little more of the plot of the film. Check it out below: Taking place a good deal of time after the events of the second season of the TV anime, protagonists Yuta and Rikka have decided to elope together after they receive news that Rikka's sister wants to take her to live in Italy. The scene at the train station gate where Rikka implores Yuta to go on without her is all the assurance I needed to know that the film will be just as ludicrously-amusing as the TV series, due in no small part to Rikka's believing she is a fantasy heroine. The movie will be released in theaters across Japan on January 6, 2018. While supplies last, you'll be able to receive a random clear file with your ticket to see the movie. At least one of the folders will feature the key visual for the film, which you can ogle below. I've always found myself empathizing just a bit with "Wicked Eye" user extraordinaire Rikka Takanashi. In addition to being one of the funniest romantic comedies the medium has to offer, the series does an extraordinary job of unfolding the internal struggles precipitated by being a patient of chunibyo - living largely within the confines of internal delusion and fantasy. I'm likely speaking for many who grew up with video games, anime, and multitudes of other depictions of the unreal -- it's super easy to become caught up within the worlds and lore of your favorite stories. The addition of the series' main male protagonist Yuta Togashi adds a super-interesting romantic dynamic to the work. He's a "graduated" chunibyo patient himself, and their relationship grows with that added layer one-sided understanding. The Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions franchise was born from a light novel by Torako. It has gone on to receive two seasons of anime from Kyoto Animation, who decided to animate the novel after it received an honorable mention during the studio's annual internal "Kyoto Animation Award" event. Take on Me will be the second film in the franchise, coming after 2013's recap film which told the events of the first season from Rikka's perspective.

Whether it was done on purpose or not, the post-appocolyptic setting for "Planet of Sand" leaves a whole lot of room for your imagination to run wild, and it's certainly got me excited. Acting as the theme song for Magical Mirai 2017, the annual Hatsune Miku concert thrown within Japan, you may know Hachi for his record breaking Vocaloid tracks such as "Matryoshka", "Panda Hero" and "WORLD'S END UMBRELLA". Outside of his Vocaloid producer status however, you might know Hachi under his real name, Kenshi Yonezu, the very same one behind theme songs such as My Hero Academia's "Peace Sign", as well as March Comes in like a Lion's "orion". He's also worked closely with producers such as Yasutaka Nakata, the producer of mega-groups such as Capsule, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu and Perfume. Featuring a visually stunning music video from Minakata Laboratory, the team previously worked with Hachi on his other music videos, including those featured in the Project Diva series. If we could get a full anime following this style from the team at Minakata Laboratory, I don't think there'd be a word within the English-language that could describe my excitement. There's also a very clear reason why this was chosen to be the theme song for such a large-scale event like Magical Mirai, and I can't help but fawn over it the same way I did my first time listening to "Matryoshka". Finding his footing in the world of Vocaloid around May 2009, we've seen some of the most recognized Vocaloid songs stem from Hachi's creative prowess.

She's the genius behind a wide-array of my favorite online illustrations, and continues to impress with each and every piece she releases. With her ever-growing presence, both online and offline, the budding illustrator is now finding herself operating a limited-time collaborative cafe with Japan's most popular maid cafe, maidreamin, for a short period of time in August, 2017. Taking place at maidreamin's Shibuya location from August 4 - 6, the cafe gives fans the unique opportunity to meet kiato, as well as enjoy the delicious collaborative drink made available for this period of time. Each day offers a different happening, with the 4th reserved for the sales of collaborative goods, including t-shirts, mirrors, badges and acrylic key holders, the 5th will allow fans to participate in a "one-coin drawing request", and the 6th offering a special live from producer/DJ Yunomi. I can't wait to get my hands on that delicious-looking penguin soda float, and look forward to supporting the artists that make my online feeds so enjoyable! Between drawing sessions from Kiato and the special live event from Yunomi, I feel the worlds of illustration and music colliding, which has me more than excited.

11527|2017-07-24|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/love-otaku/| News | Anime | "Love is Tough for an Otaku" is Getting the Anime Treatment | Love sure is tough for an otaku, and this upcoming anime aims to showcase that. |I feel like there's been very few instances in my life where the title of an anime has spoken to me on this many levels, but this one really gets me -- I mean, love really is tough for an otaku, right? The real point there, however, is that one of my most enjoyed manga in recent memory is getting the anime treatment. It was revealed in truly dramatic fashion on the jumbo-sized screen on the ALTA building in Shinjuku, Tokyo. You can watch that very same announcement trailer below, which recently began streaming online: The focus of the story is the slow-blossoming relationship between Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose. Meeting at the most mundane of places, their office, the two soon realize that they have some degree of compatibility. Hirotaka is a gigantic game otaku, and Narumi happens to be a fujoshi. The manga has rather humble beginnings. In 2014, author Fujita first published the initial bits of their manga on pixiv, a prolific Japanese art sharing site akin to deviantart. The manga was picked up by Comic POOL, an online digital manga magazine in 2015. The print versions of the manga volume have enjoyed considerable success at 4.2 million copies printed. Since then, the manga has prevailed as one of my favorites due to the relatable characters and the way they are realistically depicted -- which while probably not my proudest claim, I find myself similar to Hirotaka in more ways than one. I too, am struggling to find that perfect balance between work obligations, social life, and the absolutely crazy flood of games that have been coming out recently. Oops. The anime is slated for April of 2018, and will premiere on the Noitamina block on Fuji TV. In the meantime, I'm off to decipher the key behind this very conundrum as well. |Love is Tough for an Otaku, Love is Hard for an Otaku, Fujita, A-1 Pictures, Tomokazu Sugita

Locales on a Bus with On-Board Cafe | Anime tourism is about to reach a whole new stage in this collab between a Japanese bus company and Cool Japan. |It's pretty hard to process the fact that it's been over one year since director Makoto Shinkai's global smash-hit "your name." debuted. The film sent legitimate shockwaves throughout the Japanese film industry, breaking all kinds of records for animated movies, including topping all domestic records held by Studio Ghibli in ticket sales, save only for Spirited Away. Incredibly enough, the film debuted not in Japan, but in the United States during Anime Expo 2016, before going on to become the highest-grossing anime film of all time the world over. The real locations featured in the film -- spots around Tokyo, the Hida-Takayama area in northern Gifu prefecture, and Nagano prefecture, have all enjoyed no small boosts in tourists who are eager to see the stunningly-recreated locales from the film in real life. Living right on the border of Gifu prefecture myself, I've seen my fair share of branded goods, souveneirs, and ticket packages offering to immerse you in the world of the film once more. Now, with the official release of the Blu-ray and DVD versions of the film upon us, one company has decided that offering another shot at lucrative anime tourism was too good a chance to pass up. Partnering with Cool Japan Travel Inc., bus company Willer plans to offer the "your name. Cafe Bus in Tokyo" from August 3 through September 29 of this year. From the sneak-peek provided on the official site, the food offerings seem to be quite elaborate. If you've seen the film, you may recall a scene wherein one of the characters took a totally Instagram-worthy picture of their pancakes, and the snack above is reminiscent of that very moment. Additionally, everyone who takes part will receive one of the above-pictured coasters at random. This tour is centered on the Tokyo locations from the film, and will last approximately 90 minutes. Check out all of the locations covered by the tour in the slideshow below! There's no way I'll be missing out on this event, especially as an avid fan of the film myself. If you can't make it this time, stay tuned. But for any fan of the film, this looks like one of the best "anime pilgrimages" you can embark on. Tickets are 5,800 per adult, so if you happen to be in the Tokyo area during the next few weeks, be sure to book through the official site, which thankfully is also being offered in English. your name.

Practiclly the entire time I was watching the startlingly-endearing series a few years back, I imagined taking the helm of one of those majestic metal machines to engage in my own version of simulated wargames. It seems that now, one movie and six planned special finale episodes later, the time has come for me to dive head-first into the space that was previously only occupied by Wargaming's World of Tanks. On the topic of World of Tanks in relations to the Girls und Panzer series, the two franchises have indeed gone as far as to officially collaborate clear back in 2013, back when the massively multiplayer online battle game first saw an official release in Japan. Bandai Namco saw fit to finally cut out the middleman however, and simply take matters into their own hands. It's an absolutely gorgeous looking game, blending luscious-looking environments with the striking and colorful cast of characters that the series is well-known for. You can watch the trailer below, killing two birds with one stone - you'll get a glimpse of both the anime's finale episodes and the game. So far, it's looking like an even more colorful and fast-paced version of World of Tanks, perhaps with even less of the strategic planning and more straight-up action. 『ガールズ＆パンツァー ドリームタンクマッチ』PS4で今冬発売決定！本作品らしい臨場感・爽快感のある戦車の動きをお楽しみいただける戦車アクションゲームとなっており、オンライン対戦も可能になります！https://t.co/kfKm9qp4Lp #garupan pic.twitter.com/NZgBU0l0yp — 「ガールズ＆パンツァー」公式アカウント (@garupan) July 20, 2017 Set to debut on the PlayStation 4 this winter in Japan, Girls und Panzer Dream Tank Match will feature online multiplayer matching capabilities between legions of Sensha-do commander hopefuls.

When the monsters came, they didn't wait for heroes to fall from the skies and save them, they saved themselves. Showcased in the latest trailer for the upcoming Pacific Rim: Uprising which is set to begin screening February 2018, we're given a closer look at the Jaegers and weapons, as well as the characters that are here to defend the Earth. Set to the tone of Ellen McLain, the A.I. of the Jaeger from the first film, -- or perhaps better known as the voice of GLaDOS from the Portal series -- we're introduced to our new and improved Jaeger fighters who will likely be pit against a series of giant monsters in the upcoming film. Taking screen about three-quarters through the video, we're given a look at the son of Stacker Pentecost, Jake Pentecost who is being played John Boyega. There's a lot of questions still to be answered leading up to the screening date, but what we do know from the new teaser, as well as the website that accompanies it, is that we'll likely be seeing Jake piloting the Gipsy Avenger -- the fittingly-named successor to the early-model Gipsy Danger.

I'm not even simply talking about anime born of international funding such as FLCL Seasons 2 & 3, or even the classic adult swim hit The Big O. I'm talking about the fact that American comic legend Stan Lee has now lent his hand to two co-productions now -- his credit in both the 2010 Heroman and the recently revealed The Reflection -- as well as musicians such as Porter Robinson throwing their own hat into the arena with success stories such as Shelter, a collaborative project with A-1 Pictures. Who could forget early 2000 classics such as Tekkon Kinkreet and Afro Samurai too? When it comes to American-born talent paving the way for the next generation, nobody does it better than famed animator LeSean Thomas. Breaking down international boundries through his series' such as The Boondocks and Legend of Korra, Thomas has recently moved on to producing his own anime, kicking off with last year's Cannon Busters. If you ask me, I'd dare suggest that the defined line that would shape what makes an anime so "anime" over the years is being blurred over the years, and I love it. That's where LeSean Thomas' latest premiere, Children of Ether, comes into the picture: 1st official teaser to my newest anime creation w/@Crunchyroll #ChildrenOfEther! In 300 select theaters for #AnimeMovieNight, Weds July 26! pic.twitter.com/j8PWwizJe2 — LeSean Thomas (@LeSeanThomas) July 20, 2017 The whole project is looking absolutely mind-blowing. Directing the project at Yapiko Animation, a studio in which calls both Paris and Tokyo home, Thomas finds himself alongside an entire list of big name creatives. Handling storyboard direction is Shingo Natsume (One Punch Man, Space Dandy), alongside character designer Hiroshi Shimizu (Michiko & Hatchin). Animation director Yuichi Takahashi (Gatchaman Crowds) and animator Mitsuo (Iso Denno Coil) will be jumping on board for this wild ride as well. Crunchyroll have provided a synopsis of the premiere episode: Children of Ether follows Rhonda, a woman with a dark past and a mysterious power, as she is pursued by an unknown assailant after the death of her father. Aided only by her wits and a pair of orphans, Rhonda journeys through a decaying, dystopian metropolis populated by raiders, gangs, and the supernatural. As she struggles to survive in this harsh urban tangle, she meets both friends and enemies, and searches for answers about this power, "The Ether", awakening within her. You'll be able to catch the Children of Ether premiere during Crunchyroll's Anime Movie Night event. Slated for a July 26 screening across three-hundred movie theaters, Crunchyroll are clearly ensuring as many people as possible have access to the event. So far, the Anime Movie Night initiative has only been announced for Crunchyroll's home turf of the United States. You can check out the official site here for the exact details on the screening, including theater locations and advance ticket purchasing. |Crunchyroll, LeSean Thomas, Cannon Busters, Children of Either, Shingo Natsume

Funnily enough, it's been abotu four months since I made possibly the biggest mistake of the entire year, I forgot the pre-order the aforementioned console. Throughout those four months, I've witnessed firsthand the release of an entire roster of promising titles for the console-handheld hybrid, with names such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8: Deluxe, Arms, and now Splatoon 2 springing to mind. But do you want to know what I haven't witnessed over those last four months? Widespread availablity of the Nintendo Switch to the masses here in Japan. Thinking of picking up a Nintendo Switch to play the hyper-stylish Splatoon 2 this weekend? Good luck, you'll definitely be needing it. That is, unless you've got a wallet larger than your self-restraint. Head on over to Amazon JP and you'll find all sorts of pricings, with most of them ranging around the ¥‎50,000 (roughly $446 USD) mark, which is an entire ¥‎20,000 over retail price. Now of course, it's worth clarifying this isn't necessarily Amazon's fault, with no official stock available to them, the store is simply acting as a marketplace for resellers looking to make a quick buck. Looking inside physical locations often won't yield any results either, and the odd time you stumble across a used system at a second hand store, you can expect similar prices to Amazon JP's listings. Making my way to a few stores in North America while I was there for Anime Expo offered absolutely no success either, with most store clerks simply laughing at me when I would ask if they had any in stock. It's upsetting, but probably not as upsetting as the situation many are finding themselves in, with many attempting to by the system only to be scammed out of hundreds of dollars worth of Amazon gift cards, as examplified below: Switchが届く確信が持てません。 コード入れてみたけど20000円分もう使われてました。詐欺られたかもです。 誰か助けてください。 pic.twitter.com/sgzuBb3TyA — しゅんちょこ（寝落ち勢） (@shunchoco3321) 16 July 2017 It's uncertain whether or not Nintendo has any plans to flood stores with stock to time closely with the massive launch of Splatoon 2 on the console. Being someone who has entered in multiple lotteries both online and in-store for the ability to simply purchase a Nintendo Switch here in Japan, things have been looking quite grim for some time. Feeling more like a currency than a console at this point, the few units that are made available are quickly snatched up and scalped online for a significant markup. What can I say though, I probably should have just pre-ordered the console months ago. |Nintendo, Switch, Amazon, Japan, Splatoon 2, Zelda, Mario

They made headlines a while back for their ridiculously gorgeous limited-edition custom Super Nintendo Jordan IV's that made waves for their seamless emulation of the classic Super Nintendo look. Shortly after they plucked at the strings of nostalgia once again with the Air Jordan IV SNES US, featuring a colorway easily identifiable to US fans of the SNES with it's greys and purples. Back once again, we're taken back even further in time with the 10-piece limited edition release of the Jordan "NES" IV, quite possibly the best looking customs of the whole series so far. Giving particular homage to both Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt on the tongues of each sneaker, we're presented with a striking off-white, grey, red and black color scheme that is unmistakable at first glance. On the back of each sneaker you'll find real, pressable buttons from an actual NES controller placed on there, with a Jumpman-adorned NES cartridge tag hanging off the side. Though, I'm sure a certain other jumping man could have worked just as well there. Custom sneakers like these don't often come cheap, and that's going to be your biggest catch in this situation. Limited to a total of 10 pieces, you'll be looking at forking over some $1,250 USD for the opportunity to put these sneakers on your feet. Because of that, chances are you'll never see these hitting the streets of Harajuku, but who knows -- sneakers like these certainly belong in a museum somewhere.

11482|2017-07-19|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/thomas-romain-design/| News | Anime | Thomas Romain's Design Workshop Is a Wholesome Adventure | A quick trip down acclaimed creative Thomas Romain's timeline will present one of the most wholesome father-son bonding exercises. |Every now and then you'll stumble across something on the internet that'll leave you with an entirely wholesome smile on your face. Sometimes it's in the form of an adorable image of a dog doing something that it probably shouldn't be, and othertimes it's because you've found what could be one of the cutest instances of parenting done right. It all started in December 2016 when acclaimed creative Thomas Romain (Code Lyoko, Space Dandy, Symphogear) saw a drawing his eldest son did during a family outing. It was a creative illustration, and utilized various outside-the-box extras such as artificial fur (big props for creativity!) and a blend of colorful buttons. Taking inspiration in the image, Thomas would go on to professionaly illustrate his son's character, presenting it to the whole family as an unintentional Christmas gift. From there, the rest is pretty much history -- something that would go on to launch one of the most wholesome examples of parenting done right. What I'm sure Thomas' sons didn't realize at the time of this initial drawing was that they would go on to launch an entire series of illustrations and creations spanning more than six months. Throughout the "Father & Sons' Design Workshop" series, we're showcased an entire catalog of characters designed by the Thomas' sons, and then illustrated by Thomas himself. Bridging his childrens imagination with reality, we're offered not just a wholesome set of drawings, but a legitimately impressive collection of illustrations featuring some gorgeously imaginative characters. Roughly four months after the initial illustration was created, Thomas decided to launch a Patreon campaign in an effort to help make this a more sustainable, long-lasting creative hobby for the family. Spanning over 29 illustrations, we're presented with a plethora of eye-catching monsters and captivating life forms. Their most recent collaboration between father and son, simply titled "Pink-Head Glider", features an illustration that looks like it could have been torn out of a mashup between FLCL and Symphogear: 親子デザイン工房 (No.29) ピンクヘッドグライダー 原案:長男 イラスト:パパ Pink-Head Glider Original design: son (11) Illustration : dadhttps://t.co/Iw4OzklBkR pic.twitter.com/ia9eTer90E — ThomasRomain ロマン・トマ (@Thomasintokyo) 18 July 2017 With over 230 patreons already supporting the project, I'm extremely excited to see just where this all leads in the coming months and onwards.

11481|2017-07-19|00:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/little-busters-crowdfund/| News | Anime | Crowdfunded Anime Projects are on the Rise in a Big Way | With hits such as "Little Witch Academia," "In this Corner of the World," and now even a Key project, crowdfunding of anime as a means to production is becoming super-important. |We live in a time where anime in absolute abundance, no matter how you look at it. Some would even go as far as to suggest that there might be a little too much produced each season, resulting in the current situation where there's a whole lot of eager workers, but not enough money to go around in the industry. This could even go on to be the cause of issues such as underpaid employees, or similar issues that the industry is currently facing. If the industry can foster and grow under a different set of financial circumstances, however, perhaps some positive change can be set into motion. One such alternative method to approaching the situation has been the utilization of crowdfunding over recent years. Circumnavigating the traditional processes of acquiring funding, we're seeing a rise in unconventional content that may have never passed through the industry funding, but is so desperately wanted by fans. So with the process getting more and more popular, let's take a look at a handful of crowdfunding's many success stories, shall we? Little Busters: Kud Wafter The most recent example of an anime project funded by the fans is a spinoff OVA series to 2012's Little Busters anime. Among fans of the original visual novel, Noumi Kudryavka's character route has prevailed as being particularly popular, and this project aims to give her some properly-animated closure. Currently, the project is a little more than halfway-funded on Campfire, one of Japan's many crowdfunding platforms. J.C. Staff will handle the animation, and if the project can smash its crowdfunding goal in a sizable way, then the 20 minute OVA may even turn into a full theatrical ordeal. "Great! How can I donate?" you may be asking yourself now, well, unfortunatley this project is not yet accepting support from backers outside of Japan. According to the Campfire page however, a separate crowdfunding campaign may take place, perhaps on Kickstarter. So keep your eyes peeled - we'll be the first to let you know! Hakubo Hakubo, or Twilight as it may be translated for an audience outside of Japan, is another anime success story that was born from Japanese crowdfunding site Campfire. As far as the details go, this project has been super ambiguous thus far, being successfully funded perhaps on the merits of the director's name alone - Yutaka Yamamoto. He's probably best known for his directorial work on a handful of really successful anime, like 2006's The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and 2014's Wake Up, Girls!, but also for being outspokenly critical of the industry at large and even his peers. Check out the trailer for his new film, which has been successfully funded to the tune of slightly more than 21 million yen. This was all without the help of overseas backers, and it will be fascinating to see how this conclusion to Yamamoto's "Tohoku Trilogy" will play out. Little Witch Academia: Enchanted Parade Little Witch Academia has prevailed as quite an interesting production - it's a bit more popular with audiences outside of Japan than it is within Studio Trigger's home turf, but the same can be said for almost all of their releases, not that they mind. A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015 gave birth to the Enchabted Parade film, which perhaps paved the way for the recent 2nd series of the anime currently on Netflix globally. It was fully-funded in little under 5 hours, which proves just how eager fans overseas are to help out their favorite creators. Under the Dog Now this is likely the pinnacle of western anime crowdfunding. The Kickstarter campaign for Under the Dog smashed its goal of $580,000 USD to go on to become one of the most anticipated crowdfunded anime in recent memory. It is the brainchild of studio Kinema Citrus, Creatove Intelligence Arts, and later the newly-founded Mentat Studios, whose mission is to support the work of Japanese and international anime artists globally. Check out the promising footage below. It was produced under the direction of Masahiro Ando, a man of no small fame for Sword of the Stranger and Hanasaku Iroha. Under the Dog is a Kickstarter-first project which carried loads of hype behind it. There were a few bumps along the way, as Kinema Citrus and Creative Intelligence Arts disagreed on their visions for the project after the funding was successfully met, resulting in Creative Intelligence Arts leaving the project altogether.. In order to get through this rocky period in development, Mentat Studios were formed to handle the publicity side of things while the animators at Kinema Citrus focused on their work. The project persevered however, and Under the Dog was delivered to, get this, the Kickstarter backers exclusively. There is currently no other legal alternative for viewing this work! In this Corner of the World In this Corner of the World may just be the biggest success story for this trend yet. Attaining a goal of more than $290,000, this film directed by previous Studio Ghibli veteran Sunao Katabuchi released to wild fanfare in Japan in late 2016. A co-production between studios Genco and Mappa, it tells the story of Suzu Urano, who is forced to live through the United States' bombing of her home city of Hiroshima during World War II. The concept clearly struck a chord with potential audiences in Japan, as this project was only made possible through the crowdfunding efforts of the animation-loving public there. Crowdfunding site Makuake played host to the campaign, and was only available domestically within Japan. With the animation industry so constantly on the look out for new ways to develop and grow, we as consumers are constantly left on the edges of our seats to see what happens next. Perhaps for the first time ever, we're offered a new way to give directly too the creatives who make the series' we love a reality, and to me that's something extremely special. What the next big trend following crowdfunded anime will be remains to be seen, but it's definitely a promising future that I'm more than excited about.|crowdfunding, Little Witch Academia, In This Corner of the World, Mappa, Studio TRIGGER, Kud Wafter, Key, Little Busters, J.C.

Not just content with existing purely as a game, and going beyond official manga, art anthologies and even musical performances featuring holographic versions of squid idols, Splatoon is finally receiving an official anime adaptation. It will be based on the characters found in the official manga, and will debut on Japan's CoroCoro Comic magazine's YouTube channel. In the official manga by Hinodeya Sankichi, four Squid Kids are featured - Goggles-kun, Headphones-chan, Glasses-kun and Knit Cap-chan. It's a rather simple affair, wherein we see our aptly-named members of the Blue Team battling it out versus the troublesome Orange Team. As far as this adaptation goes, many details remain to be seen. Will the stories from the manga be getting the anime treatment, or will it follow a more original path? Details including the animating studio and cast have not been revealed, but since it is a web-based series and judging from the short length of the episodes in the manga, we can likely expect these to be relatively short and sweet themselves. 【宣伝】ゲーム発売日の7月21日にスプラトゥーン2「イカすファンブック」も発売予定です！ 描き下ろしマンガも掲載されます！記事に4コママンガと書いてありますが4コマじゃないです(笑) 8月にはコミックアニメの配信やフルカラーコミックの発売もあります。 よろしくお願いします(^^) pic.twitter.com/nITKjSVcDE — ひのでや参吉@Splatoon③巻発売中 (@hinodeya3) July 16, 2017 The above Tweet by Hinodeya contains the official announcement from this week's issue of the magazine. While it's certainly a Japan-only publication, take solace in the fact that Viz Media is releasing the manga overseas later this year. Hopefully, they can find a way to get the anime translated in an official capacity as well. In the meantime, keep an eye on the CoroCoro YouTube channel for fresh episodes beginning August 12. via GameMemo (Japanese)|Splatoon, Splatoon 2, Nintendo, Video Games, Gaming
11424|2017-07-18|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/eureka-seven-skateboard/| News | Anime | Stumbling Across a Rare Eureka Seven Skateboard | Sometimes you stumble across certain things so cool, you simply can't help but share. The Eureka Seven skateboard is one of those things. |One of my personal favorite parts of living in Japan is the ability to simply stumble upon a rare, quintessential part of your childhood like it's absolutely nothing. For the most part, these finds will generally consist of a simple figure or reference littered throughout the shelves of second hand stores, but this find felt legitimately different. Where I'm getting with this of course is the discussion of my most recent find, and what a find it was. If you're a fan of the Eureka Seven series, then chances are you may or may not have heard of this product -- but I know I certainly hadn't. It was during the year 2006 that Japan witnessed one of the coolest releases of all time, the Eureka Seven liftboard-themed longboard. During one of my usual weekly trips to my favorite second hand store, I decided to take a look at the sports goods section for the first time in quite some time. It was through this very decision that I would go on to discover that there is in fact an official Eureka Seven branded skateboard, in a country where skating culture is so heavily frowned upon and near non-existent. Selling for well below what it should have been, especially in its condition, there was something that held me back from buying it -- a decision I feel I'll eternally regret. Seeing it was seemingly enough for the time however, as it piqued my interest enough to research just how the skateboard came to be. It was in early 2006 that the concept of a Eureka Seven-themed longboard first sprung to life. It was fitting, for an anime that in many ways would be considered 'counter-culture' in its themes, the production of such a counter-culture piece of merchandise made a whole lot of sense. In a time pre-kickstarter, the idea of 'crowdfunding' a product was widely considered to be insane, but for this skateboard in particular to ever see the day of light, it required at least 100 pre-orders locked in at a price of 23,800 yen ($230 USD). It's unclear how many of these decks actually exist, but we can at least set it at over a hundred, but I'll estimate no more than 300-400, though I could be completely out of the park. Presented as a neat collectable item for fans of the series, as well as an ideal board for individuals in their 20's to 30's, the board represented something that I feel in this current day and age is needed more than ever -- a gorgeous official crossover between the worlds of anime and street culture and fashion. If nothing else, the board was a legitimately intriguing find that sparked renewed interest in official merchandise for Eureka Seven, and it made me even more excited for the upcoming trilogy of films. Should I have purchased the board? Yes. Will I forever regret not taking the plunge and simply picking it up? Probably also yes.|Eureka Seven, Skateboard, Longboard, Book Off

While the former may have it's negative side-effects (hair loss, for one), the latter has proven to be nothing but positive. From One-Punch Man to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and even series like Naruto: Shippuuden and Gurren Lagann, Shingo Natsume has played an important role in them all. So when the opportunity arose to personally sit down with Natsume himself, it wasn't something we were going to turn down. In part three of our video interview series, Shingo Natsume discusses his involvement with the One-Punch Man animated series, as well as the underlying themes and occurrences. Even though Shingo Natsume may not have originally been familiar with the One-Punch Man series when he was originally asked to direct the anime, he knew a work of art when he saw one. After his initial reading of the web-comic and manga series, he knew that there was a lot of potential to build on, and that's when he got to work on his role as a director. To him, One-Punch Man was so much more than just another hero story, and that's the way he intended to work with it. Not cutting corners was of the upmost importance to Shingo, as he worked tirelessly inspired by a handful of Western films such as Deadpool. Everything had to work, and once the finished product was finally ready, it was clear that this would be the next big thing. If you're interested in checking it out, Shingo Natsume's latest directorial work, ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. can be streamed on Crunchyroll, here.

Tracing its roots to a California-based Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter Alpha 2 tournament, EVO has drawn together so many of the absolute best within the fighting game world to compete inside games both new and classic. I mean this quite literally too - what other kind of event could have possibly birthed the likes of Street Fighter champ Daigo "The Beast" Umehara? EVO is truly an international event. Players from more than 44 countries have gathered over the years to throw down, so it was only a matter of time until the organizers decided to take their own brand of hype worldwide. Thinkining about it, so many of these games come from the minds, hearts and souls of Japanese creators, and not to mention the sheer number of Japanese players who attend the event annually. It's only logical that Japan would be the next stepping stone, and we're only a short way away. EVO Japan will be held from January 26-28 2018, and I couldn't be more excited. Check out the slickly-produced trailer for the event below: The lineup for the whole event has me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see the battles that unfold within them: Tekken 7 Guilty Gear Xrd REV2 The King of Fighters XIV BlazBlue: Central Fiction Super Smash Bros. for WiiU Arms Street Fighter V and the undoubtedly loads of other titles receiving side tournaments, both official and unofficial Far and away, the biggest surprise on that list is the inclusion of Nintendo's brand-new, unconventional Switch figher Arms. Personally, I have a ton of questions. Which of the multiple control methods will be utilized? Will the tournament roll with the stunningly precise motion controls method? Will they enforce button play? Will that actually be up to the individual fighters? Being someone who actively enjoys the game, I'm pretty eager to know some more details. Get those passports ready fighters - this is an opportunity to dive head-first into a huge chunk of Japanese popular video-gaming culture. I cannot think of a better weekend experience than this for passionate fighting game fans, and I urge you to keep an eye on EVO Japan's official site for more information on the tournament as it is revealed, including the exact venue, registration details and accomodation options.|Fighting Games, Evo Japan, EVO, BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, Tekken 7, Super Smash Bros., Arms, King of Fighters XIV

Right now, as I type up this article, I have the Twitch tab opened up on my second monitor. All weekend long, I've been watching the best of the best of the fighting game world duke it out across loads of games. It's the ultimate e-sports event, and what better place than EVO to reveal one of the most exciting new fighting games to grace our screens in recent memory? Shortly after Ryusei_Carl cleaned up house to take it all in the BlazBlue: Central Fiction finals, Arc System Works decided to drop another bombshell over the already roaring crowd - you seriously need to see this: If you're a fan of fighting games, then you're undoubtedly familiar with BlazBlue's Ragna and Under Night In-Birth's Hyde. And heck, if you're just a fan of video games in general, then of course you've made the acquaintance of Persona 4's Yu Narukami, even if you didn't know that ArcSys previously developed 2 full versions of a fighter based around the franchise too. But what almost no one expected - in what is the rose-colored petal on top of this extra-layered cake, is the inclusion of Ruby Rose, protagonist of the anime-inspired, cult CG hit RWBY. The show has been very popular in Japan, so this adoption of the American franchise by a big name in Japanese gaming is pretty significant. ArcSys director Mori Toshimichi has gone on record in the past stating that if he were to do another game based on a pre-existing franchise, that RWBY would be one of his top picks. This project seems like a nice middle ground. Not much else is known about the tag-team style 2v2 fighter, including details on who we can expect to appear in the game. From viewing the trailer, we saw Jin Kisaragi included from the BlazBlue side of the cast, so it's likely fair to expect appearances by other characters from the other three properties. BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle is currently slated for a 2018 release, and I couldn't be any more excited for it.|Arc System Works, BlazBlue, Persona, Persona 4, RWBY, Under Night In-Birth, Fighting Games
11409|2017-07-15|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/coco-ichi-gundam/| News | Anime | CocoIchi Curry's New Gundam Collab Is out of This World | Even Newtypes need a tasty meal - and trust us when we say this collaboration is out of this world! |Japanese curry is delicious - this is an indisputable fact. For most of the staff here at OTAQUEST, Japan's most famous dealer of the dark concoction is a restaurant called Curry House CoCo Ichibanya, and it's almost like lifeblood. On top of all else, they also happen to do some incredibly cool cross promotions with some of Japan's biggest pop-culture icons. Take earlier this year for example, where the Nagoya-born curry chain teamed up with Lupin the Third to give away a Fiat 500. And while that's cool and all, this next collab in particular is quite literally out of this world. I can't say we didn't know it was coming, afterall, during our almost daily trips to pick up CocoIchi (oops), we absolutely saw the signs plastering the wall, featuring none other than Mobile Suit Gundam's Amuro Ray. As with all of these collaborative efforts, there is of course some giveaways tied to its name, and while I don't want to go into too much detail about them specifically, I'll give a quick rundown of it all. There's two main ways to win prizes, and both of them for the most part are pretty harmless. If you spend at least 900 yen in store, you get to stick your hand in the Gundam Box! No, that's not it's official name, but if anyone reffers to it as anything else, they probably shouldn't be eating at CoCo's. Inside the Gundam Box you will be pulling out a special card that tells you which free Gundam coaster you've won. The second way to win will involve you taking a photo of your receipt and submitting it online, for your chance to win some seriously cool collaborative merch. The collaborative merchandise basically comes down to four prizes, though none of them come from the Gundam Box. Firstly, we have a collaborative figure limited to 1,000 units, that basically features a CoCo Ichi-branded Gundam standing proudly with its spoon. Possibly one of the greatest figures of all time, anybody that takes this from me will make me very sad. Following this, limited to 300 units is a collaborative plate featuring an illustration of our spoon-wielding guardian, nice. Again limited to 300 units is the Gundam spoon set, and then after that with a total of 1,000 units is a 1,000 yen discount voucher. There's a whole lot going on in this collaboration, and I absolutely love it. Just note, I did order CoCo Ichi delivery today, and the driver did not bring the Gundam Box with him, so I guess that one is store-only.

Right now, as I type up this article, I have the Twitch tab open up on my second monitor. All weekend long, I'll be watching the best of the best of the fighting game world duke it out across an entire catalogue of fighting games. It's the ultimate e-sports event, and what better place than EVO to showcase one of the most anticipated new fighting games to grace our screens in recent memory? I'm talking of course about the fact that Bandai Namco have brought the E3 2017 demo build of Dragon Ball FighterZ to the show, and will be hosting 4 tournaments throughout the course of the entire event. Huge names in the fighting game sphere will be particpating, and I'm sure we're all in for a wild time as veteran players adapt to a brand-new game on the fly. You'll be able to see the likes of Justin Wong, Shinobi, KUSANAGI, Sonic Fox, and Flux go Super Saiyan on each other, and you'll probably end up getting even more pumped for the official release in the process. During the pre-event streams I've been watching, it was confirmed that a variety of popular fighting game commentators will join in to give us the blow-by-blow, notably including Vicious. The first tournament has already begun, running from 10:00 am PST to 1:00 pm PST on July 14. Later today, from 2:00 to 5:00, a second tournament will take place. Another 2 are scheduled for Saturday the 15th, at the same times that today's tournaments are being held. Check out the official stream below, and Watch live video from BANDAINAMCOUS on www.twitch.tv When Dragon Ball FighterZ was officially announced at E3 last month, many were surprised at the amazing pedigree behind the title. Arc System Works are a Japanese company responsible for some of the best, most well-polished, mechanically-tight and just plain beloved anime-style fighting games out there. The creators of the Guilty Gear and BlazBlue franchises have dipped their toes into officially-licensed properties before with Persona 4 Arena, and many will agree that even it remains one of the best games of the genre. Dragon Ball itself is also no stranger to fighting game adaptations, with the Budokai series of 3D fighting games enjoying massive amounts of success. Thinking about it now, these are two worlds that were just meant to cross. If you haven't seen the game in action yet, then you owe it to yourself to check out the official trailer below. The game officially releases for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC early next year. This is a surefire way to drum up even more hype for the game, as I'm sure that it will get eager players talking about the game's tech and the strategy required to dominate in this 3V3 fighter.|Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Arc System Works, Gaming, EVO

Featuring an awe-inspiring vocal track from famed anison artist LiSA, we're instantly whisked away on a fantasy adventure through her powerful lyrics. But it turns out we're not the only ones being tugged into an adventure, with the ED featuring our favorite to-be heroes completely fitted in what appears to be fantasy gear straight out of an role-playing game. Turns out fans of the series absolutely love the concept of it all, and are going as far as to request it get made into a fully-fledged OVA in the near future. I mean, can you really blame them? The ED is incredible, and possibly one of the most eye-catching I've seen in quite some time. If the whole idea of the animation is to give viewers a reason to stay and see the incredible talent that worked on the series, then you can bet I'll be reciting them all in absolutely no time. can we all collectively agree, as a community, that there should be an ova created around this concept pic.twitter.com/xeQFg5pNVc — aisho (@BAKANEKl) 8 July 2017 It's almost terrifying looking at the images, out of context I'm sure anyone would believe that this is legitimately an anime about questing and adventures. If the whole UA class were to perhaps someday find themselves in such an alternate universe, whether that be in the form of an OVA or spin-off series, I know I alongside many others wouldn't have a single issue with it.

11401|2017-07-13|17:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/crunchyroll-original/| News | Anime | Crunchyroll Takes Next Step Towards Nurturing Anime Industry | As a platform Crunchyroll thrives off of the anime produced each season, and now they're taking the next step towards contributing to that production. |It goes without saying that the influence that Crunchyroll has had over anime industry throughout the last several years is rapidly increasing. Perhaps to those analyzing the company from a consumer standpoint, they would likely come across as just another anime streaming website–but it's the backend of things that has had my interest piqued for quite some time. Outside of their anime streaming services, many are actually unaware that Crunchyroll have also been involved in the production of content for quite some time. Series such as Studio TRIGGER's own "Kiznaiver" was in-part produced with the creative efforts of Crunchyroll, with many of their own staff actually finding themselves within the series credits for various roles. In October 2016 we witnessed what would perhaps be the first widely recognized work with the Crunchyroll name to it; Porter Robinson and Madeon's "Shelter" music video, an animated short made in collaboration with A-1 Pictures. Though the reality of things is they had been involved in anime for quite some time before that, it was nice to see the company thrown into the spotlight for that period of time. For Crunchyroll however, this was simply seen as a starting point for something so much larger. You may have read recently that Crunchyroll has partnered with NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan in a joint effort to co-develop original anime. It seems like a natural progression, especially with Crunchyroll being the international distributor for NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan's animated series' including "Berserk", "Seven Mortal Sins" and "The Fruit of Grisaia". Through this partnership, Crunchyroll hopes to co-develop a string of titles that reach a level of "international appeal" thought to be lacking in a majority of modern anime. In example, of the 36 original anime airing this season, and the 8 returning anime, there's a strong chance that a very small percentage will truly strike it big with international audiences, with this partnership aiming to increase that percentage. ​Since 2015 the company has invested in more than two dozen animated series, proving time and time again their commitment to the industry that has given us all so much. Since breaking through the one million paid subscriber mark in early February, one can only imagine the general financial output into the anime industry that must come from Crunchyroll. Without jumping to too many conclusions, I'd dare suggest that there's even been a notable increase in the quality of anime over the past few years, likely due to this new flow of revenue into the industry. Perhaps set to see the light of day before anything from the NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan partnership, we've got the upcoming October 2017 release of Crunchyroll's co-produced "Urahara"; an anime adaptation of their "PARK Harajuku: Crisis Team" web-manga series. Utilizing a star-studded lineup of both staff and voice actors, we're perhaps given our first real look at what Crunchyroll has in mind for their original content driven future. Even if we are still quite some time away from seeing the seeds of this partnership flourish, I'm extremely excited to witness just what Crunchyroll can pull off, and have high hopes for their continued contributions to the anime industry as a whole. Where they go next is only limited to their imagination, it would seem.|Crunchyroll, NBCUniversal Entertainment, Anime Industry, Original
11400|2017-07-13|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/fullmetal-alchemist-trailer-poster/| News | Anime | Fullmetal Alchemist Live-Action Film Receives New Trailer | Today's a massive day for Fullmetal Alchemist fans, with a new trailer, posters, and more revealed for the series' upcoming live-action film. |This has been an absolutely massive week for fans of the Fullmetal Alchemist series, and more specifically those with an interest in its upcoming live-action adaptation. Seemingly out of nowhere, we received an absolute avaclade of information, including a third trailer, three gorgeous new posters showcasing the films cast, as well as a few new details pertaining to the film. Shared via the official website for the upcoming Fullmetal Alchemist live-action film, we even saw some love for foreign fans of the series in the form of an official English-language trailer, which can be streamed below: Opening with a suspensful battle scene containing both Edward and Al locked in the midst of a battle, the trailer perfectly sets the scene for what we can expect from the film. Throughout the rest of the trailer, we're thrown back to some familiar faces from the original animated series, making for a seriously enjoyable trailer. Currently sitting as the #1 trending video on YouTube Japan (Well, the Japanese trailer at least), this news has definitely been met with a level of excitement amongst audiences over here. The film is set to tell the entire story of Fullmetal Alchemist throughout a singular complete film, something that many other live-action adaptations of anime fail to do. The posters shared via the official website also do an incredible job of introducing us to our cast, and do an excellent job of hyping up the film. Set to open in Japanese theaters on December 1, I'm sure we can expect to see plenty more sneak previews before then. Helming the project will be Fumihiko Sori as director, who previously worked on the live-action adaptation of Ping Pong. Hearing that news was genuinely more than enough to get me excited, so you can count me in on the screenings for this film. His comments regarding the upcoming live-action film can be found below, including his thoughts on the all-Japanese cast: “I want to create a style that follows the original manga as much as possible. The cast is entirely Japanese, but the cultural background is Europe. However, it’s a style that doesn’t represent a specific race or country. There will never be a scene in which a character says something that would identify him/her as Japanese.” Fans who can make it to the screenings of the film in Japan will also receive a special-edition comic from the original creator of the series, Hiromu Arakawa. It's expected that further information detailing just what we can expect from the aforementioned comic will be revealed at a later date, but for now they've certainly got me excited. For further information on the upcoming live-action adaptation, be sure to keep an eye on the official website for the film, here. |Fullmetal Alchemist, Warner Brothers Japan, Winry, Al, Hughes, Hawkeye, Mustang, Envy, Lust, Gluttony, Fumihiko Sori, Ryosuke Yamada, Tsubasa Honda, Dean Fujioka

In an official announcement shared by the team at Crunchyroll today, we finally got our first major information reveal for Urahara, and boy is it something to fawn over. Before we get too into that however, let's talk a little bit about just what you'll be getting yourself into this October when the anime begins airing. In the city of Harajuku, where fashion culture and all things cute gather, three girls by the names of Rin, Mari and Kotoko are developing a limited-time store known as "PARK". One day however, an alien entity appeared stripping humanity of any culture that they held onto. To protect the Harajuku they know and love, these three girls must rise and fight back. Based on the real world location of PARK Harajuku, a neat little shop located just off Takeshita Street, we find ourselves following the adventures of three girls as they fight off an alien invasion in an all new anime sci-fi adventure. Yes, you read that correctly, this is set to be a sci-fi adventure rather than the traditional 'moe slice-of-life' anime. Ahem. You can expect real world fashion tropes delivered through our three main characters, as well as a pretty unique insight into just what happens behind the scenes in Harajuku's bustling fashion industry. Taking on the role of director for the project is Kubo Amika, previously having worked with Super Milk Cow. This is set to be her first time working with an animated project of this style, so I'm extremely excited to see what she brings to the table as a creative. Working alongside her will be Arakawa Masatsugu, who is best known internationally for his work with FLCL, Ghost in the Shell, and numerous other titles. Helming series organization will be the esteemed Natsuko Takahashi, who has worked with well recognized titles such as Akira, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Ore Monogatari!!, and so much more. Working character design will be Mariko Fujito of Cardcaptor Sakura and Initial D fame. So yeah, definitely something to fawn over. The incredible lineup of staff doesn't end there however, we haven't even gotten into the voice actors and our main characters yet. Voicing our queen of street fashion Rito Sudo (left) will be the revered Haruna Luna, who prior to this was perhaps best known for her roles as an anime OP/ED artist for series such as Fate/Zero, Monogatari Series, Sword Art Online and a variety of others. Joining her as the slightly-preppy Kotoko Watatsumugi (middle) will be Manaka Iwami who is rapidly rising in the industry for her work with series such as Gamers!, New Game!! and the anticipated Childern of the Whales. Last but certainly not least voicing our favorite gothic lolita character Mari Shirako will be Sumire Uesaka, an award-winning voice actress who is best known for her roles in Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!, Kancolle and iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls. With only 3 more months until we're finally able to watch Urahara, I couldn't be any more excited. The team has gone out of their way to make a point out of their mostly-female staff roster, and you can totally see why. The incredible roster leading into the anime is filled with female pioneers of the anime industry, and we're more than ready to see what they are going to bring to the table. There's still so much more to learn about the upcoming series, and we'll be sure to keep you up-to-date.

Last season you may have known them as the artists behind the incredible OP theme for Alice & Zoroku, and now they're back once again with a super RPG-inspired music video and track to kickstart your week. Titled 'Trip Trip Trip', the song is the accompanying OP for this seasons modern adaptation of the classic anime Mahoujin Guru Guru. Opening the music video with a battle screen seemingly straight out of a Final Fantasy game, we're then offered the gorgeous vocals of Pon to kickstart the hyper-bubbly adventure we're about to begin. Running just short of four and a half minutes, the music video is filled to the brim with ORESAMA's signature flare, including their incredible illustrations that have been accompanying them since their earliest 2014 releases. If you're looking for the perfect song to help get you through the rest of the week, this has to be it, and I can't wait to see what ORESAMA comes up with next.

11393|2017-07-12|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/park-otaku-mode/| News | Anime | PARK Harajuku Begins Intl Sales Through Tokyo Otaku Mode | PARK Harajuku are officially spreading internationally through the announcement that their internet-age fashion goods will be made available globally through Tokyo Otaku Mode. |There's always a distinct excitement when I'm given the opportunity to share some new piece of news relating to my personal favorite Tokyo-based fashion store, PARK Harajuku. It's my own little treasure trove of niche goodies, and has ultimately gone on to define almost my entire wardrobe through their new age internet-otaku styles. Not a single friend of mine can step foot into Tokyo without making the holy pilgrimage to the Harajuku-based store -- though I guess that might not be the case much longer, now that PARK is officially teaming up with Tokyo Otaku Mode to make their goods available online for international audiences. Falling right alongside the stores focus, an internet-connected age of "Creation x Fashion x Otaku", and seemingly perfectly coinciding with the announcement of their upcoming anime project Urahara, the news of this collaboration is definitely welcomed in my eyes. "I can't be certain about the percentages for in-store customers, but I do know about 30% of our website traffic comes from international viewers" shares PARK Harajuku co-owner Kazuki Kanayama, in regards to the questions about why the timing seemed so right for this collaboration with Tokyo Otaku Mode. Their looks have largely gone on to define the new-age Harajuku movements, and it's extremely exciting to see that very movement expanding overseas as well. Whilst you won't necessarilly find the exact stock you would find in-store, you'll at least find every piece of actual PARK-branded fashion and accessories. Each piece of gear made available through Tokyo Otaku Mode will feature either the stores mascot characters, the stars of the upcoming Urahara anime, an adaptation of the Crunchyroll-published PARK Harajuku Crisis Team, or characters stemming from the brands numerous collaborative efforts. If you're interested in checking out the online store, you can find it on the official Tokyo Otaku Mode webpage, made available here.

11374|2017-07-11|20:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/gintama-live-action/| News | Anime | Gintama Movie Breaks the Mold of Live-Action Adaptions | Could the "Gintama" live action movie set a new precedent for live action adaptations of anime? |When I think about the long-running Gintama animated series, there's a few words that come to mind; colorful, stylistic, lively, humorous, and even poignant. But when I initially heard that there'd be a live-action adaptation of that very same series on its way, you'd have to forgive me for expecting a very different set of words to come forward. That being said, here we are just mere days before the debut of the film nationwide here in Japan, and I've most definitely done a total 180 degree turn on any pre-conceived notions I held. Warner Brothers Japan have recently shared an all-new trailer for the aforementioned Gintama live-action film, and it's through this very trailer that we're offered an even closer look at the fan favorite "Benizakura" story arc to the series, this time stepping into the realm of live-action film. Before we get any further into things, you can check that very trailer out below: Firstly, you almost immediately notice both actors and actresses absolutely nailing their respective characters in both mannernism and personality, all accompanied by the bright and colorful costumes and hair stylings that we've come to know and love. If nothing else, I have no doubt in my mind that this film will present a convincing alternative take on Japan's esteemed "jidaigeki," or "period drama" samurai films that mostly anyone will be able to get into the groove of. Perhaps in stable opposition to the trend of sedate Hollywood adaptations of rather serious franchises like Ghost in the Shell or Netflix's Death Note, the Japanese film industry is content with allowing some of the (potentially unavoidable) cheese to stick around in order to remind us exactly from which world Gintama is coming from. The special effects all-in-all look pretty good, all things considered. The budget certainly won't be matching the likes of the latest 'Bay flick, but little things like the tentacles emerging from the Benizakura sword itself are a nice touch for sure. The presence of the gang's glossy-looking CG-rendered pet alien dog Sadaharu reminds us that we can't get too complacent with our newfound earthly surroundings however. If both new and returning Gintama fans can walk out of the theater feeling as though they have witnessed a genuine slice of the Yorozuya gang's antics, the movie will have accomplished its mission. Tackling one of the most popular arcs in the entire series, whilst also maintaining a faithful renditions of Gintoki's natural perm, it might just not be too hard of a landing to stick. The inclusion of the iconic opening scenario of the entire saga in which Shinpachi and Gintoki meet for the first time is more than enough to leave me feeling giddy. If you haven't seen that scene however, I'll leave you with this earlier trailer that depicts that exact scene itself. Gintama opens in theaters across Japan on July 14, and you can expect the excitement over here to stay pretty consistant until I can finally check it out.

11386|2017-07-11|17:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/kero-kero-bonito-free-live/| News | Music | Kero Kero Bonito Are Throwing a Free Show in Tokyo | Kero Kero Bonito are making their way to Japan this Summer, and their bringing their latest album with them alongside a show for anyone who purchases a copy. |Quite possibly one of the most quirky musical groups to emerge from the internet music scene over the last decade, Kero Kero Bonito have made their presence known globally through a constant slew of incredibly bubbly tracks. Utilizing the bilingual talents of vocalist Sarah Midori Perry layered over the enchanting production talents of both Gus Lobban and Jamie Bulled, we're offered a hyperactive bubbly internet-age electronic pop sound that has been in high demand here in Japan's underground music scene. In an announcement that went public recently, the band announced that they would be signing with Sony Music Japan to bring their sounds over here to Japan, and alongside this announcement was news of their performance at Summer Sonic 2017 and a free show for fans who purchase their latest album "Bonito Generation". There's few acts with as much charm as Kero Kero Bonito, and as someone who has been listening to them for almost as long as they've been around, it's such a treat to see them grow so globally. With the news that they'd be the latest talent to join Sony Music Japan's increasingly global talent roster, we can likely expect to see a whole lot more presence from the band here in Japan. Kickstarting this will be their "International Tanoshi Sound" live event that will be taking place on August 22. Joining the band will be Japanese rap duo chelmico as well as DJ YonYon. Entry will be limited to 300 people, and will be exclusively granted to those who pick up a copy of the bands most recent album which releases today in Japan.

11385|2017-07-11|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/lupin-stole-my-heart/| News | Anime , Manga | How Lupin the Third Stole My Heart After All These Years | Lupin the Third has long been a series pushed to the back burner of my watchlist, but it was absolutely about time that changed. |There are numerous moments throughout the history of Japan's expansive pop culture industry that have largely gone on to define global perceptions of this small island nation. In 1963 we saw the birth of modern anime through the eyes of Mighty Atom, perhaps best known internationally as our little robot friend Astro Boy. In the 1980s through until the late 1990s we witnessed what would be defined as the "Golden Age" of anime internationally, birthing numerous series and films such as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Dragon Ball, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Sailor Moon. But tossed somewhere between those two major moments in the history of anime was the release of a series that predates most modern anime fans, all whilst playing an integral role in the lives of so many here in Japan. I'm talking of course, about Lupin the Third. Passed through the hands of so many, Lupin the Third was a series originally created by mangaka Monkey Punch in the August of 1967. Shortly after in 1971 we would see the airing of the acclaimed Lupin the Third: Part I, which would evidently become the basis for an entire animated universe; one which would be directed by the likes of creatives such as Hayao Miyazaki (Yes, the very same one from Studio Ghibli), Sayo Yamamoto (Again, the very same one who brought us the likes of Yuri!!! on ICE and so much more), as well as a wide variety of other talent throughout it's extensive lifespan. Let's put everything I just mentioned aside, all facts that I have known for a considerable amount of time, and ponder this simple question -- why did it take me so long to start watching Lupin the Third? It's not an understatement to suggest that over the course of my life I've probably listened to the musical works of series composer Yuji Ohno a hundred times or more. It would actually be his approach to jazz and works with the Lupin series that would finally drive me to pick it up, but why it took so long remains a long pondered internal mystery to myself. That little question aside however, let's talk about Lupin the Third. If there was ever a time to talk about Lupin the Third in a modern setting, the time is most definitely now. Perhaps now more than ever, anime fans are given the unique opportunity to jump into a series with over 50 years of history in the industry. With Funimation beginning the streaming of their official English dub for the recent fourth entry into the series, aptly titled Lupin the Third: Part IV, there's been a notable fresh influx of both new and returning fans of the series. Though it's not necessary at all, I myself have opted to begin from the original Part I and work my way through. Like many anime of its time, the structure of Lupin the Third doesn't follow the standard continually flowing story format; rather, it instead opts to largely allow each episode to be its own self-contained story, with very few details carrying between episodes. The story pits a diverse and likable gang of master thieves in an avalanche of varying situations that wrap themselves in a thick veil of comedy and action. It's incredibly easy to find yourself completely lost in the adventures contained within Lupin the Third, with every episode feeling as humorous as the last. It's an anime that has aged extremely well, especially compared to similar anime of its time, and that's why it's so exciting to see that there is still such prominent support for it within the industry. The 2015 Lupin the Third: Part IV is widely considered by many to be one of the best installments into the series of them all, and alongside Sayo Yamamoto's Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, has gone on to define many modern audiences understandings of the series. We haven't even scratched the surface of the films, both animated and live-action, that exist within the Lupin the Third universe, and I truly feel like they could be discussed forever. There's a million and one entries into the world of Lupin, but don't let that scare you in the slightest. The very thought of not knowing where to start, let alone what to watch, was what held me back from this series for so long, only for me to realize that it absolutely doesn't matter. If you're a fan of gorgeous '70s animation-style with the signature flare of Hayao Miyazaki, by all means start with either Lupin the Third: Part I or Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro​, his entry into the Lupin film universe. Otherwise, don't shy away from simply jumping into Lupin the Third: Part IV, as well as Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. In sharing this with you all, I simply hope that I can spread the joy that Lupin the Third has brought to me with everyone else, especially as it continues to rise as a personal favorite for so many reasons. If you're interested in checking out any of the televised anime entries into the series, the best place to start would be Crunchyroll's massive collection, which can be found here. |Lupin the Third, Italian Game, Fujiko Mine, Sayo Yamamoto, Hayao Miyazaki, Yuji Ohno
11373|2017-07-11|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/yuri-on-onsen/| News | Anime | "Yuri!!! on ICE" Gets Steamy in Onsen Collaboration Event | When you've spent all day on the ice, I'm sure there's absolutely nothing better than dipping yourself into the warm embrace of one of Japan's traditional onsen. |When you've spent all day on the ice, I'm sure there's absolutely nothing better than dipping yourself into the warm embrace of one of Japan's traditional onsen. Even amongst the heat of Summer here in Tokyo, there's always room to take a quick dip and just forget everything going on around you, except Yuri!!! on ICE that is. You can't ever forget Yuri!!! on ICE. That's where Tokyo's latest collaboration comes skating onto the scene, with tourist-favorite Ooedo Onsen Monogatari, one of Japan's most popular onsen destinations, joining forces with Yuri!!! on ICE to create a winter wonderland right in the middle of summer. Of course, it wouldn't be a collaboration without collaborative goods and food, and boy have they got you covered on that. You can expect to partake in Yuri!!! on ICE games; be able to pick up some exclusive goods, and even dine on some Yuri!!! on ICE-themed meals. Did someone say katsudon? The collaboration will be taking place throughout the rest of summer, all the way through until August 20, 2017. But that's enough fluff, let's get into the fun part -- here's exactly what you'll be able to enjoy during your relaxing time at the onsen: Acrylic figure stands, keychains, clear file-folders, pillows, and even a scale -- better hope you can get it before it slips out the door. After you've finished soaking to your heart's content, and especially after you've shopped til you drop, it'll be time to hit up the food court for some official collaboration meals and snacks. Of course, Yuri's katsudon comes away as a clear no-brainer here, but let's take a look at some of the other delicacies you can sample. I think I'll be taking of a couple of servings of that JJ Style Food!!, especially given chili-smothered fries are not something you'll come across too often here in Japan. Prices all range from 780-1280 yen, or about $8-13 USD. There are a variety of games to take part in as well. The two highlights are a traditionally-styled stamp rally, which tasks you with wandering the resort and to ink up the collaboration's unique notebook with all of the characters. Those who are successful will receive either one of the fans seen below, and everyone who participates will get one of the bath bags. It's a lot to take in, but the sheer amount of goods and general activities tied into this collaborative event are definitely not something to be missed. I'd even go as far as saying this might be the first time even I've seen a collaboration event go this in all at once, but I guess I'll just have to wait until the real thing. If you happen to be in Tokyo this summer, and also happen to be a fan of Yuri!!! on ICE, this is definitely not an event to miss.

11375|2017-07-10|20:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/ujico-moe-shop-pastel/| News | N/A | Ujico & Moe Shop Collaborate For Blissful 'Pastel' Jam | The long-anticipated joining of forces between Tokyo-based Ujico*/Snail's House and France-based Moe Shop is finally here. |The extremely long-awaited collaboration between both Tokyo-based Ujico*/Snail's House and France-raised Moe Shop is finally here, and spoiler, it was absolutely worth the wait. Ever since its initial announcement a few short months ago, I think it's fair to say myself alongside almost the entire electronic music community were left sitting on the edge of our seats waiting for this very moment. Let's take a step back however, and analyze just how this whole masterpiece came to be, as well as the genius process behind getting it out there for us all to enjoy. Opening with the lush chords of any signature Moe Shop track, there's this very immediate air of surrealism to the whole scenario. Picture this if you will, two of the most talented producers to grace the ever-expanding internet music landscape finally join forces to create one powerhouse song together, creating something that you've seemingly been wishing for forever. With this knowledge in mind, we then have Ujico's piece burst into the track, utilizing his signature leads to perfectly layer and compliment Moe Shop's sounds. The rest of the track flows very similarly, with a steady flow of complimenting, rather than challenging. Proving to be an absolutely gorgeous adventure from start to finish, we reached out to the ever-talented Moe Shop for a brief word about the process of working with Ujico on this piece: I've wanted to work with Ujico for a while now, but everytime we tried we both ended up being extremely busy. Eventually I came back to Japan for an event I performed at called POOL Osaka, and I pretty much crashed at Ujico's house for an entire afternoon. I brought some chords, and we started playing around with them from there. I came back a day later and we finished the entire track that night. One thing that I noticed while working with Ujico is that we both have very little knowledge about music theory, we just tend to go with the flow. He draws melodies, and I chop chords here and there. Together we had a really smooth workflow I think. Ujico makes everything look so easy, I love it. If you're interested in checking out either of these incredibly talented artists, you can find Ujico on SoundCloud, as well as Moe Shop on SoundCloud as well.

While the former may have it's negative side-effects (hair loss, for one), the latter has proven to be nothing but positive. From One-Punch Man to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and even series like Naruto: Shippuuden and Gurren Lagann, Shingo Natsume has played an important role in them all. So when the opportunity arose to personally sit down with Natsume himself, it wasn't something we were going to turn down. In part two of our video interview series, Shingo Natsume discusses the formative roles that creatives such as Ayumu Watanabe, as well as Watanabe Shinichiro played on him, leading up to his work on One-Punch Man. At one point or another, everyone takes guidance from another individual. Whether that be big or small, the information learned will often go on to shape various viewpoints and stances. Shingo Natsume was no exception, and it was through his gradual climb up through the ranks that he would go on to learn the things he did. During his work on series such as Doraemon, Tatami Galaxy, and even Space Dandy, Shingo explains that he took on everything those above him would teach. It was through those teachings that he would eventually go on to become a director himself. Looking back with a laugh, Natsume reminisces on all the things he would change if working on Tatami Galaxy at his current level of knowledge. With the highest of respect for his creatives, he would also go on to discuss his fond appreciation for Watanabe Shinichiro's creative decisions, especially when choosing his staff for the animated projects he was directing. If you're interested in checking it out, Shingo Natsume's latest directorial work, ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. can be streamed on Crunchyroll, here.

The magazine, which would go on to become the home of classics such as Doraemon, Kirby, Duel Masters, Beyblade and so much more played an essential part in the childhoods of so many, not just domestically, but internationally too. I'd be lying if I was to say that the magazine is as recognized as say, something like Shonen Jump in the US, but the properties and stories that it has fostered over the years certainly have broken multiple borders and touched many. This year has been an extremely busy one for the magazine, with multiple celebrations and events going on all in the name of endless-youth. It's definitely been a while since I was in the target demographic for the magazine, but you're crazy if you think I didn't make sure to pick up a copy of the 40th anniversary comic on release. But that's likely not going to be the end of my CoroCoro craze, especially now that their limited-time cafe here in Tokyo is getting a menu refresh. Japan is well known for having some of the craziest collaborative cafes, and this is absolutely no exception. Between the extremely photogenic Usotsuki! Gokuo-kun burger shown above, all the way to the absolutely delicious looking Duel Masters ramen, which by the way, includes seaweed stamped to look like actual Duel Masters cards, I'm obviously going to get a little excited. This is of course, the second installment into the menu, and if the first part does happen to stick around, you can also expect to pick up some pretty incredible Pokemon-themed burgers and spaghetti as well. The second installment of the menu is set to be available from the 15th of July, with the actual cafe operating until September 3rd. Taking place at the TOKYO Solamachi​, right at the base of the famed Tokyo Skytree, it's an absolute must-see if you're in the Tokyo area any time soon.

11303|2017-07-09|14:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/nisioisin-exhibit/| News | N/A | Wander Through the Worlds of NisiOisin in Tokyo this Summer | A special exhibition featuring all of the works from prolific author NisiOisin is coming to both Tokyo and Osaka this summer. |It's very much a fair statement to say that the characters of NisiOisin are almost instantly recognizable to any modern-day anime fan. With the success of works such as the Bakemonogatari series, both in Japan and overseas, as well as the catalog of other hits like Kubikiri Cycle, and finally with the upcoming anime adaptation of Juni Taisen, the time seems just right to collect all of that worldbuiling and characterization and put it all together for fans to enjoy. That's why you should definitely keep your eyes peeled for the upcoming NisiOisin Dai Jiten exhibition, taking place all across Japan. The exhibition is being promoted with an eye-catching poster featuring the words from the master himself, as well as artwork for his various series from illustrators take and VOFAN. You'll be able to catch it if you're in Japan during the bulk of the late summer. From July 27 to August 7, the exhibition will be open in Tokyo at the Ginza location of department store Matsuya. After that, the exhibition hits the road for Osaka, where it will be open at the Daimaru Shinsaibashi department store from August 9 to August 21. I have a strong feeling that this is going to be one event I absolutely have to check out. It remains to be seen just how much of the event will be divided between the actual prose of NisiOisin vs. the artwork that is featured in his series. If it turns out to be a text-heavy showing, then your mileage will of course vary depending on how much Japanese you know. In any case, it's obvious that there's a demand from fans to become more involved with the author's worlds, so color me interested. Overseas, NisiOisin's works have been steadily picked-up for publishing. If you are interested in taking the dive into one of Japan's biggest pop-culture phenomenons, I would recommend the Monogatari series, which begins with Kizumonogatari. Vertical Inc., the publisher of the series in the Americas, have provided a concise background on the master himself. There are few authors in Japan who have reached the heights of success as NISIOISIN. Born in 1981, NISIOISIN left Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, to pursue a career in story-telling. Initially he had ambitions to be a comic artist, but when he realized his art was not up to snuff, he began to focus on his writing. He would eventually win the 23rd Mephisto Prize, for Kubikiri Cycle (Del Rey), acknowledging his talents as a mystery writer, at the age of 20. Since his debut in 2002 he has penned more than 50 novels and a number of comics. NISIOISIN's works often cover themes of youth, but are framed in genres that are familiar to the masses. His works tend to mix mystery with comedy and touches or romance and/or the supernatural. He is a modern author in every sense, sometimes even experimenting with the Japanese language itself. Many of his works have been adapted into animated television series and films. His best known works are the MONOGATARI series and Katanagatari.

Sayonara No Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana o Kazarou, with a yet unoffical translation as Let Us Adorn the Morning of Farewells with Promised Flowers has been announced for release in theaters across Japan on February 24, 2018. A movie that about the interwoven connections between people; a story of meetings and departures - take a look at the newly-released trailer below. Okada has worked on a number of tear-jerkers in the past. If you have seen the likes of True Tears, Anohana, The Anthem of the Heart, and Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea, then you are very well familiar with what could be happening with this film. Who knows though, as she has also worked on the likes of Toradora! What exactly has lead to her finally getting the coveted directorial role? According to Oricon News, P.A. Works CEO Kenji Horikawa has always been impressed with her work, and wanted to see what kind of project she could lead with total artisitic freedom, giving it her 100%. Okada herself has gone on to say that this movie will be a manifestation of a story that she has always wanted to write, and that she welcomes the challenge of finally being able to affect further the further aspects of filmmaking beyond screenwriting, such as the actual movement and sound. Mari Okada's direction is just the icing on the cake though. She is directing the film at studio P.A. Works, so we can likely count on her having a team composed of the immensely-talented people behind some of the most visually-stunning shows of the past few year. If that trailer was any indication, I'm hoping to experience a 120 minutes chock-full of pure, background art bliss. Another huge contributor to the project is character designer Akihiko Yoshida, who most recently worked on unexpected smash-hit game Nier: Automata and even Bravely Default. Be sure to keep an eye on the official site, which happens to be looking just as gorgeous, for updates on official artwork and staff. An official staff blog for the project is also listed as "coming soon." You can find it right here.|Mari Okada, Film, Anohana, Anthem of the Heart, P.A.

For the second time ever, we're seeing an anime series stemming from Japan, based on an original concept by Marvel-founder Stan Lee. We're also fresh off the heels of Anime Expo 2017, which through it's record breaking numbers further proved that the time is ripe for such international relations and growth. But nothing quite drives the point home like these incredible Wonder Woman renditions by various creatives from Japan. Calling on the talent of some of Japan's most diversely talanted and recognized artists, we realized the potential in recreating the Wonder Woman image with each artists unique touch. Kicking off the event, which was dubbed #WonderWomanCreatorsCollab, we saw the Hello Kitty collaboration which we covered in the past, here. Following that was a collaboration with famed Japanese doll Licca-chan, which saw the doll dressed in the armor of Wonder Woman. From here on is where things started the capture my interest, with Warner Brothers Japan calling on the talent of Sword Art Online character designer Shingo Adachi and later Creamy Mami character designer Akemi Takada. ⭐️高田明美さん⭐️ 『魔法の天使 クリィミーマミ』や『機動警察パトレイバー』などを生み出したキャラクターデザイナーの高田明美さんによる #ワンダーウーマン #ワンダーウーマンクリエイターズコラボ #ワンダーウーマンアート展 pic.twitter.com/QyNPnRB2L6 — 映画『ワンダーウーマン』公式 (@wwmoviejp) 7 July 2017 Each of these entries were absolutely gorgeous, and did a lot to add a new layer to the already well-defined character of Wonder Woman. However standing out from the rest as an absolutely eye-catching piece of art was the collaborative illustration with Studio TRIGGER illustrator and character designer Ishizaki Toshio, perhaps better known as Sushio. The illustration perfectly illustrates the ability and signature-style of Sushio in so many captivating ways, and myself as well as apparently everyone else on the internet are totally in love with it. Featuring both Wonder Woman and Superman within the same image, it's easy to see why we can't get enough of it: ⭐️すしおさん⭐️ 『キルラキル』、『天元突破グレンラガン』などのアニメーターのすしおさんが描いた #ワンダーウーマン はスーパーマンと一緒！#ワンダーウーマンクリエイターズコラボ #ワンダーウーマンアート展 pic.twitter.com/Tj8tjtLK2V — 映画『ワンダーウーマン』公式 (@wwmoviejp) 7 July 2017 We're sure Sushio has been an extremely busy man as of late, especially with Studio TRIGGER having just announced three original animated projects at this years Anime Expo, so it's nice to see him taking somewhat of a break. If we could somehow get an anime Wonder Woman series that looked as good as Sushio's illustration, I can only imagine the hype surrounding it. Of course, only time would tell, especially with Wonder Woman's Japan theatrical release just around the corner. |Studio TRIGGER, Sushio, Wonder Woman, DC, Superman
11359|2017-07-08|10:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/jojo-live-action-3/| News | N/A | JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's Live-Action Is Looking Decent | It may not exactly be perfect, but it does seem that with each and every trailer the film is slowly redeeming itself piece by piece. |Without spouting too many assumptions, there's always been a common belief that live-action adaptations often fail to entice with the same charm as their anime counterparts. Whether it comes down to constraints within the budget, or even downright poor directorial choices, it would seem live-action adaptations are simply destined to fail. But while there's definitely a list of adaptations that I personally believe outshine their anime equivalent, such as Assassination Classroom, I probably align very closely with this unfortunate belief that things will usually work out poorly. Possibly one of the most debated unreleased live-action adaptations of all time, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable, the film has already gone on to spark massive debates about the current state of anime adaptations. When it was first announced several months ago, film footage hadn't even been released and it was already being slammed by online communities all around the world. What was set to celebrate the 30th anniversary of one of Japan's most beloved manga series, instead threw fuel onto the fire of anger towards poorly executed live-action films. It's been about seven months since then, and while the internet still seems extremely confused as to how to feel in regards to the film, I at least personally feel a little more at ease watching the trailer. With less than one more month until release, I can only imagine the Warner Brothers Japan is probably going into full marketing mode for the upcoming film. Finally showcasing a lot of what we can really expect, rather than some fluff footage skipping over the all-important details, I can easily say I feel a lot more at ease in regards to my personal opinion on the film. It definitely took a while for me to conclude this, but I've come to realize that as long as a film at least portrays the story I love without jeopordizing the fundamentals, I probably won't have any issues with it. Anything else including the quality of the CGI is simply icing on the cake. Quickly scrolling through the YouTube comment feed for the trailer presents a pretty unanimous vote from Japanese viewers however, bringing forward their issues with both the cast and acting -- though that comes as little surprise. What they are enjoying however is the overall look of the film, with some even going as far as to state that they enjoy the look of the CGI. Personally, as long as they can nail Josuke's hair, I'll have absolutely no complaints. With just under a month until screening in theaters across Japan, I'm excited to see how it all pans out, as well as if the outrage of online communities is actually warranted or not. I mean afterall, nobody wants to see a poor entry into one of their favorite series', right?|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Diamond is Unbreakable, Live-Action, Part 4

Running for a total of 90 seconds, we're thrown back and forward between the extremely nostalgic scenes of the original 2005 animated series, and then forward into the upcoming film that we're all so excited about. The whole trailer is an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish, jumping between feelings of joy to sadness to excitement and everything in between, all within its 90 seconds running time. With a screening date across Japan of September 16, 2017, we're bouncing up and down in anticipation, all while running through the originals alongside Renton Thurston as he takes off on his journey. The full trailer can be screened below: Alongside the release of the trailer we saw a full refresh of the films website, featuring some gorgeous new visuals and information.

11301|2017-07-07|11:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/animator-dormitories/| News | N/A | You Can Help Make an Animator's Life Easier | Standards for animator pay in Japan are quite low, but you can directly affect some help, and perhaps even change. |In recent times, it has become ever more apparent that animators in Japan’s anime industry have it rough. You may recall a story from just a few weeks ago wherein Studio Khara, the talent behind the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, were able to pay potentially newly-hired animators just slightly more than the industry average at around $920 USD -- which really is not great, especially when you consider the need to pay the always costly Tokyo rent. Standards for animator pay in Japan are quite low, but there's a few things available to industry outsiders that they can do to help, and even change the lives of the next generation of creatives. This is where the Non-Profit Organization known as Animator Supporters comes in: Animator Supporters have identified 3 key risks for Japan’s animation industry workers: Animators in their twenties often make no more than 90,000 yen a month 90% of new animators quit within 3 years due to low pay and harsh working conditions Without proper support and mentoring for animators, Japanese animation as a cultural pillar risks collapse Jun Sugawara from Animator Supporters has come forth to present the organization’s fundraising goals in English. As of now, they have run 3 successful crowdfunding campaigns both within Japan and overseas to tackle perhaps one of the biggest issues facing young animators today: housing. The yearly "Animator Dormitory Projects" aim to raise money for affordable dorm-style housing for animators. Paying no more than 30,000 yen a month including utilities costs, animators can skirt Tokyo's rent prices and live in an environment where they can not only survive, but thrive. Remember the point about young animators not receiving proper support and mentoring? The goal with the dormitory project is to allow an environment where new animators can learn from the more experienced hands. This year, the English campaign lives on Indiegogo's Generosity platform, and Jun has outlined the project's mission and history: Our goals ・To make an environment where start-up animators can devote themselves to their work without worrying about whether they can pay their house rents or make a stable living ・To bridge the skill gap caused by income inequalities ・To create a space where start-up animators can learn techniques from skilled animators so that they will be able to make a stable living in the animation industry. Since March 2014, we have established the Animator Dormitory in order to achieve these goals. In Animator Dormitory, animators can stay live there for 30,000 JPY per month (including utility expenses). They will also get chances for social exchanges beyond the boundaries of companies and receive technical support for illustrations and drawing. Our History • March 2014 First Animator Dormitory opened in Asagaya • March 2015 Animator Dormitory in Ogikubo opened • March 2016 Animator Dormitory that is bigger opened in Asagaya • March 2017 Girls Animator Dormitory opened in Naritahigashi. As of May 2017, eight animators are living in the Animator Dormitory. Of course, what I'm hoping to inspire through outlining all of this is at least your visit to the project's page, here. With a campaign that is running until the year's end having already eclipsed 50% of its goal, it is exceedingly clear that many people value the prospect of improved conditions for the people working so hard to create the content we love. And hey, there ae some pretty sweet perks for donating as well. Do you want to actually just hang out and chill with these folks? Well, that's a perk you can unlock at just a $150 USD donation if you've helped in the past, and at $300 if you are donating for the first time. One of my favorite aspects of the project as a whole is the human aspect brought about through social media, especially Facebook. The animators who you are supporting often take the time to write their feelings out, conveying them to all of the project's followers. Check out some recent examples: These creatives have already gained so much through the project's support -- how cool is this? One of our residents, Mr. Masaaki Tanaka, has been credited as "Assistant Animation Director" in episodes 36 and 37 of "Attack on Titan"! pic.twitter.com/UGzuOxJjS7 — animator_supporters (@animatorsupport) June 21, 2017 As a hyper-avid consumer of Japanese animation, the chance to affect meaningful change in an industry that has done so much to enrich my life these past 12 years or so is an incredibly meaningful one. My goal is not necessarly to coerce everyone to donate to this project directly - after all, we all have our own lives and circumstance to deal with - but merely to raise awareness. If we can help foster the creativity of the next big name in anime, someone that perhaps the next generation will be able to consume and enjoy, then I know we will have done our little bit to keep the industry alive. Thank you Animator Supporters for your continued dedication, and know that you will have my continued support. 2017 Animator Dormitory Project: Generosity.com Animator Supporters: Official site (Japanese)|animator supporters, GoFundMe, Generosity, Attack on Titan, Animation Industry
11302|2017-07-07|10:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/reflection-stan-lee/| News | N/A | A Look at Comic Legend Stan Lee's New Anime | Stan Lee has dipped his toes into anime before, but his latest project seems the best yet! |These last few days have brought with them a whirlwind of new information on Marvel Comic's maven Stan Lee's latest collaboration anime project, so what better time to reflect on everything we know so far? Announced clear back in October of 2015, The Reflection is a collaboration between Stan Lee's POW! Entertainment and Studio DEEN, who are well-known for their work on recent titles Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. Once conceived as a short single-episode work, the project has been expanded into a full cour TV broadcast anime in Japan. The early stages of the project didn't reveal much in the way of animation, but the original trailer featuring the story and concept was narrated by Stan Lee himself, so that was pretty cool. Let's take a look. If anything, it certainly smacked of a Western comic book. Director Hiroshi Nagahama (known for some seriously beautiful and rather unique animation styles as found in Mushishi and The Flowers of Evil) joined forces with Lee as co-creator. Officially, he's directing and serving as the character designer for the project. Today, we finally get to take a look at what the talented staff at Studio DEEN have been cooking for the past year and a half. That sure is something, huh? Featuring heavy outlines and a diminished color palette, The Reflection certainly does look like the flat pages of a comic book in motion. Lee's first anime co-production with 2010's Heroman featured bright colors and a familiar anime style, so it does seem that Nagahama's knack for experimentation is giving us what we're seeing now. One thing that both projects do share however? Just a whole lot of America. Heroman ® Bones, POW! Entertainment Japanese idol group 9ine are not only performing the theme song for the show, but they will also be making some pretty substantial cameos as well. It seems that peak crossover between East and West has been achieved, and I'm pumped to see where this all goes. The anime begins broadcast in Japan come July 22, and Crunchyroll will be simulcasting the series online. Laying down my lines for the English dub of POW!'s new anime program: The Reflection! Keep your eyes peeled for the release! #KingofCameos pic.twitter.com/VVPQUfVjvj — stan lee (@TheRealStanLee) July 5, 2017 Oh, and I absolutely cannot wait to see what kind of cameo Stan ends up making this time!

11314|2017-07-04|08:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/trigger-ax-2017/| News | N/A | Studio TRIGGER Announce Three New Animated Projects | Studio TRIGGER went all out at this years Anime Expo, announcing three brand new animated projects as well as teasing a little Inferno Cop. |It was roughly an hour before start when I entered the JW Marriott ahead of my most anticipated panel of the entire convention, studio TRIGGER's industry panel. I thought to myself "Oh, I'm arriving over an hour so I should be able to secure myself a pretty solid seating position!", but that was nothing short of my first mistake. With an hour to go before guests were even to enter the panel, lines were wrapped well around the corner of the hotel. I cautiously approach the middle of the line, with a slither of fear within -- I ask the nearest person "What's this line for?", only to have the dreaded response come back to me "Oh, this is for the Trigger panel." Welp. I'm not going to act like I couldn't just jump to the front, because thankfully I could, but the sheer shock of the line size left me well aware that people were going to be turned away. You see, TRIGGER is unlike any other studio over here in North America -- they're a studio with one of the most dedicated international fanbases in the whole world, and it's absolutely terrifying. Upon entering the panel room, we find our seats and await the enormous audience to enter. That's when things get a little crazy, with an announcement made to stay calm during the next happening. Suddenly the studio staff burst into the room holding cash guns, firing countless amounts of TRIGGER money into the crowd. Things go absolutely wild, only to be followed up with an all new episode of Inferno Cop, which could possibly be one of the wildest to date. It was filled with crossovers from all TRIGGER universes, as well as an appearance from Donald Trump and an extremely American Little Witch Academia cast. We learnt a lot of different exclusive information about the Little Witch Academia characters, which I'll go into more detail about at a later date. But the real mainstay event of the show was the announcement of three new animated projects from the team at TRIGGER. So let's go into a little bit of detail in regards to that: New Title #1: DARLING in the FRANKXX (TRIGGER x A-1 Pictures) There's currently very little known about this project in particular, but what has been shared is both it's title and it's collaborators. We can disclose that the project is in collaboration with the acclaimed A-1 Pictures who have absolutely taken the animation industry by storm over the years, and on top of that it will be titled "DARLING in the FRANKXX". We were also shown a brief PV which is set to be released on July 5th in Japan, so we have that to look forward to as well. Shared on the official TRIGGER Twitter account was the above image, which is slightly less impressive than the one shown to those of us at Anime Expo.

I'm a huge fan of Daoko as an artist, and I may spend a bit much of my mental effort into looking into her message and delivery. When I heard that she was to lend her talents to the newest feature-length anime film by Studio Shaft, you could say that I was more than a little intrigued. The new anime film, Fireworks, Should We See It From the Side or the Bottom?, based on the 1993 Japanese live-action drama of the same name, is the latest from Studio Shaft and director Nobeyuki Takeuchi (Bakemonogatari, Revolutionary Girl Utena). Daoko is one of the J-pop world's recent darlings; her distinct rap stylings can be found in works as recent as Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul clear back to TeddyLoid's hit Animator Expo work MeMeMe! Check out the preview for the new theme song below. With Daoko's powerful vibes and the animation powerhouse behind the Monogatari series, will Fireworks, Should We See It From the Side or the Bottom? be well-equipped to take on the likes of last year's hit your name.? Only time will tell, but at least hardcore Shaft-heads are likely in for an absolute treat. For a brief synopsis of the film, which will debut across theaters in Japan on August 18, check out the passage below. This story takes place on a certain day during summer vacation. Before the local fireworks festival, a group of young boys are arguing amongst themselves: “If you look at fireworks from the side, are they round or flat?” In order to get their answer once and for all, they decide to climb the town’s lighthouse before the display begins. One boy of the gang, Norimichi, has a crush on the class idol, Nazuna. In a mysterious incident where time is rolled back, Norimichi finds himself invited by Nazuna to run away from home with her.

After all, it's not comprised of the usual 12 episodes that we are used to - it was conceived as a 2-part special for broadcast on Japan's NHK network. You may be familiar with director Hideaki Anno's Japan Animator Expo project however, and that is the genesis of what is now a full-length production of The Dragon Dentist. When the Japan Animator Expo project debuted in early 2014 with the aim of highlighting new directorial talent, it brought with it a short, 8 minute piece from Kazuya Tsurumaki entitled The Dragon Dentist. It told the story of a country with a humongous dragon serving as a protective deity. Nonoko, a girl having just been appointed the dragon's official dentist, discovers a boy-soldier named Bell inside the dragon's mouth. He had been resurrected there, and that is an omen of many perils to come. It was a smash-hit, and it's clear why it warranted a more fleshed-out sequel. Hideaki Anno served in the executive producer and sound director roles, while Kazuya Tsurumaki returned to reprise his role as director. With the full-force of Studo Khara at their backs, this work was easily propelled into award-winning territory. At this year's Shanghai International Film and TV Festival, The Dragon Dentist beat out other contenders like Chi's Sweet Adventure and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. for the coveted Magnolia Award for Best Animation. The official Twitter account for the Japan Animator Expo even came in to relish the win. TV animation "The Dragon Dentist" wins the Best Animation Magnolia Awards at STVF. Here comes the photos of Director Kazuya Tsurumaki pic.twitter.com/vPJdsDGQ6d — 日本アニメ（ーター）見本市 (@animatorexpo) June 27, 2017 Amazingly, NHK even went as far as to dub the show in English for overseas audiences for the official broadcast. Unfortunately, it hasn't been archived, but Sentai Filmworks is releasing an official Blu-ray copy of the anime in America. You can check out the absolutely gorgeous trailer below: Below, you'll find the official synopsis of The Dragon Dentist provided by Sentai Filmworks: Going into war against a dragon takes incredible courage, but even that danger pales in comparison to the hazards of young Nonoko’s job. As a Dragon Dentist, she’s charged with venturing into the jaws of the country’s dragon protector to keep its pearly canines free of plaque, decay, and other debris. One day, Nonoko discovers an unconscious soldier between her dragon’s teeth instead of a cavity, and she finds herself caught up in a series of events that have been foretold to bring disaster to her people! Get ready for an incredible brush with destiny that leads two young people through the mouth of hell and towards certain doom as the creators of the new Evangelion feature films unleash an epic unlike anything you’ve seen before in The Dragon Dentist!

11313|2017-07-03|05:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/flcl-international/| News | N/A | Adult Swim and Production I.G Reveal "FLCL" Sequel Trailer | The sequel(s) to "FLCL" are finally coming, and you can expect differing release methods depending on where you happen to live. |If anything can truly signalize the Japanese animation industries increasing calls to appeal, and maybe even reliance on markets outside of the country, the latest addition to the FLCL saga may just be that shining example. The original 6 episode OVA was definitely a success story in Japan, but the impact that the show had in the American market when it first broadcast on adult swim in 2003 is hard to overstate. Fooly Cooly, revealed to be the actual pronunciation of the titular runes, would go on to be rebroadcast on the network multiple times due to popular demand that year. Suddenly, Gainax would become a household name to a whole new generation of casual anime viewers through TV broadcast; an audience that perhaps had no clue of the studio's esteemed Neon Genesis Evangelion. Fast forward then, if you will, to the present day. The Gainax name is, admittedly, perhaps a little less eye-catching than in the past, and has sold the rights for FLCL to another heavyweight anime studio - Production I.G. They, together with the assistance of that same adult swim that profited so much from the juggernaut of a short-form OVA series so many years ago, have come back to regale us with more in the saga of Haruko, Naoto, and Canti. If you are anything like me, you're about to feel a whole hell of a lot younger again. adult swim has provided an official synopsis to not the singular, but two slated sequel seasons: In the new season of "FLCL," many years have passed since Naota and Haruhara Haruko shared their adventure together. Meanwhile, the war between the two entities known as Medical Mechanica and Fraternity rages across the galaxy. Enter Hidomi, a young teenaged girl who believes there is nothing amazing to expect from her average life, until one day when a new teacher named Haruko arrives at her school. Soon enough, Medical Mechanica is attacking her town and Hidomi discovers a secret within her that could save everyone, a secret that only Haruko can unlock. But why did Haruko return to Earth? What happened to her Rickenbacker 4001 she left with Naota? And where did the human-type robot ‘Canti’ go? What other interesting bits can we glean from that trailer? In a departure from the planned American release of two separate 6 epsiode seasons, when FLCL 2 and FLCL 3 are released in Japan, the shows will be edited(?) together as movies. What exactly will this process involve remains to be seen. Will they straight up be mashed-together episodes sans opening and ending sequences in a simple 2 hour and 20 minute movie format, or will some other animation augury be involved? While I can't see any sort of drastic difference, only time will tell. Oh, and the pillows are back for the theme song. Count me as riding a shooting star over that detail. What of the dub cast? And hey, what even of the Japanese cast? Can everyone be brought back together for this grandiose return? While we're mulling over the nostalgic bits, the notion that the project is simply a cash-in on that nostalgia seems to haunt the thoughts of many, but I am rather hopeful that this latest blast of information have laid most of those fears to rest. With brand new directors at the helm like Kazuto Arai (experience in key animation for anime like Flip Flappers, Attack on Titan and Kabanari of the Iron Fortress), there's a good reason to be hopeful that Production I.G hopes to utilize the project as a canvas for just the kind of anime magic that we expect. Final note - cat ears headphones girl is real good. Truly the anime teen aesthetic to be strived for.

The sun set over the landscape of Los Angeles, replaced instead by the visually-intense lights and lasers of Attack the Music's own conXion, an event made possible in collaboration with the convention itself. Set to showcase the diverse roster of talent that Attack the Music is built upon, the event went above and beyond in raising the bar for anime convention dance events. There's a lot of stipulation towards anime convention dance parties, and I can't really say that I'd argue with a lot of them. There really is a lot of events that fail to meet the expectations of the crowds, and that's not isolated just to North American conventions. So when the lineup for this years Anime Expo dance was revealed, including headlining acts such as Ujico*/Snail's House, KO3, and so many others, we couldn't help but freak out just a little. You see, these names aren't just the ones who take over yours and my online feeds, but rather, they're the very names who are taking over the clubs of Japan with their incredible ability to send the crowds into a frenzy. What conXion did was so much more than just provide a great night for everyone involved, it completely raised the bar for all future events happening at conventions all across the country. Walking the halls, I can't count how many times I heard people at a loss of words for just how intense of an event it was, with many still in disbelief as to how good the event actually was. We were also fortunate enough to have full film coverage of the whole event, so you can definitely expect to see that in the near future. With Attack the Music's first major event down, now we simply wait for their next major event which takes place tonight, Neon District which will truly set in stone the legendary status of the 26th annual Anime Expo on a global scale.

The Colossus Titan itself stands at a gigantic 60 meters. But do you know what happens to be just a bit taller? The Tokyo Skytree. At a mind-boggling 634 meters in height, the Tokyo Skytree is currently the tallest tower in the world, and the second-tallest man-made structure in the world period, after the Burj Khalifa. What better way, then, to drive home the fact that you are more than half a kilometer in the sky than with Japan's colossally successful anime and manga hit Attack on Titan? Aptly named attack on SKYTREE, please join us for a tour of all this epic event has to offer! Of course, you need an appropriate greeting as soon as you step off that elevator, right? Said elevator takes you from the normal admission floors 345-350 all the way up to the tallest accessible floor 450. You know exactly what you're getting yourself into here. Let's turn the corner then and begin our spiraling ascent to the top! The walls are adorned with character portraits and a large mural depicting the key artwork for the event. While taking in the spectacular Tokyo view, you can also peek some of the show's pre-inked frames. Approaching the merch shop, the characters begin appearing in decal form on the glass. What kind of anime crossover would this be without some of that sweet merch to buy? Get all of your "Attack on Titan" x Skytree merch here. You definitely need some Attack on Titan cake sticks. Things appear to be getting a little less-serious as we approach the cafe area. The chibi decals are adorable! Of course, I totally had to get myself a Levi coffee. Every menu item also comes with a random character coaster! Winding ourselves back down and out, we come across a few more great decals for effect. The boys! Even the window washers keep within theme. In other news, these guys are probably braver than anyone in the Survey Corps... Finally, I thought you may want to see some unobstructed views of the surrounding Tokyo area. These views are to ~die~ for! Not only is it a collaboration that seems appropriate in the logical sense, but it's also a great way to get even more fans eager to spend their cash engaging with your product. I'll always hold that anime cross-promos are one of the smartest moves a Japanese company can make, as we've seen with the mega successes of other attractions like the Tobu Zoo.

Taking place at the booth throughout the duration of the convention will be a wide-variety of live shows from an incredible roster of domestic US talent, as well as an eclectic lineup of Japanese musicians. Let's have a quick recap -- we spent a large amount of time speaking with the cosplayers around the convention, looking into just why they made their way to North America's largest anime convention. There was an enormous variety of reasons, but each of them instilled a unique feeling of joy towards the community that anime has built and inspired over so many years. There was a whole lot of love shown towards series such as My Hero Academia, as well as the classics such as Cowboy Bebop. The growing presence of big name companies at the convention shows the maturing of the now 26 year old event. Dominating the event was the presence of Crunchyroll, going all in this year with big name guests such as Sayo Yamamoto amongst many others. We're sure they've got plenty lined up for tomorrow on top of this, with their panel likely set to contain a few surprises for attendees, though only time will tell. For those of you that could make it this year, we really hope you're enjoying it! If you get the chance, be sure to swing by our booth in the Entertainment Hall in the West Hall. Just follow the sounds of live music, you'll find us in absolutely no time!|Anime Expo, Los Angeles, Los Angeles Convention Center, OTAQUEST

11298|2017-07-01|12:00|Mike Tamburelli|http://otaquest.com/junji-ito-anime/| News | N/A | Junji Ito is Officially Going Anime | When you think of horror manga, it's almost impossible to not think of Junji Ito. Kind of like the fact that in any given work, a side character is the Best |When you think of horror manga, it's almost impossible to not think of Junji Ito. Kind of like the fact that in any given work, a side character is the Best Girl, it's just one of those universal constants. (Unless we're talking about Re:Zero, of course.) You're probably not thinking a whole lot about the concept of a Best Girl when it comes to these morbid stories though, so let's get on with the juicy details. A Junji Ito manga is receiving an anime adaptation. That's all we know. The Asahi Shinbun's special publishing unit for Junji Ito's works, aptly known as Junji Ito's Haunted House recently revealed the graphic you see below. "The Long-Awaited animification is coming!" Yes, I did just now make up the word "animification." At last! While his works have been no stranger to live-action adaptations for a long time now, and while his manga Gyo received a 70 minute long OVA in 2012 by ufotable, the works of this macabre master have yet to see the TV anime treatment. We'll unfortunately have to keep our eyes peeled for just a while longer to find out exactly which series to expect. I also realize that between ourselves and Junji Ito, the concept of keeping our eyes peeled likely carries quite different connotations... shudder Junji Ito has been at the manga game for 30 years now. In fact, it is likely in conjunction with his 30 year anniversary that this project has been announced. Perhaps his most well-known work in the west is Uzumaki, a gruesome story about spirals and how they are absolutely out to murder you. It has no relation to a certain ninja of the same name, and that itself is an interesting fact. It's often said that Ito wanted to subvert the usual good charms associated with spiral shapes in Japanese culture, and use that as a sort of psychological weapon against the populace. The absolute madman. Could Uzumaki actually be the work in question to receive this dubious honor? Well, that remains to be seen, and as far as I can tell, no hints of the sort have been offered in that effect. What do you say, dear readers. Have I missed something here? Which dreadful story do you want to see getting the anime treatment? Sound off below! Oh, by the way - it's definitely worth poking around Junji Ito's Haunted House over on the Asahi site. It's displayed bilingually in Japanese and English, and relates synopses of some of his recent works. A full bio of the man himself can also be found for your own bloody-good time! Obviously, you can expect the announcement of the actual work receiving the anime there shortly as well. Check it out here. As a final note, if you enjoy the heading photo, you should know that yes, there was indeed an official Pokémon x Junji Ito collab, and it is entirely worth taking a further look at.|Asahi, horror, Junji Ito, Uzumaki, ufotable, Pokemon
11286|2017-06-30|00:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/sayo-yamamoto-interview-part-1/| Interview | Anime | Interview With Yuri!!! on ICE Creator Sayo Yamamoto: Part 1 | We recently sat down and conducted the first ever English interview with acclaimed director Sayo Yamamoto ahead of the 'Yuri!!! on ICE' film. |Sayo Yamamoto is, without a doubt, one of the most diversely talented individuals in the Japanese animation industry. She's a woman shrouded in a veil of mystery, cast simply to ensure attention is set on her work, rather than herself as an creator. Set aside a few convention appearances, Sayo Yamamoto has always been one to ensure that her own hard work does all the talking she could ever need to do herself. That's why when the unique opportunity to conduct the first ever English-language interview with Ms. Yamamoto presented itself, there was no way we would turn it down. Even if you're not familiar with Sayo Yamamoto as a person, it's almost certain that you will be familiar with her works. From "Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine" to "Michiko and Hatchin", all the way to her more recent "Yuri!!! on ICE", it would appear that everything Sayo Yamamoto touches is destined to turn to gold. She started off at the bottom and worked her way to the top, one step at a time. Unafraid to move forward without ever looking back, Ms. Yamamoto is more than just a role model for women, she's a role model for society as a whole. Her signature style would go on to portray women as more than just side characters, but as powerful leaders that could do everything their male counterparts could and so much more. Conducting the interview was Dai Sato -- an individual who is equal parts a collaborator and friend of Sayo Yamamoto's. In the past, the pair worked together on animated treasures such as "Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine", "Samurai Champloo", and "Space Dandy", amongst a diverse list of other titles. The interview had a distinct air to it, feeling more like a discussion between old friends than the nitty-gritty talks between publication and director. Split up into multiple-parts, you can find the first part of our interview with Sayo Yamamoto below: Let’s talk about your latest animated series, “Yuri!!! on ICE”, and jump right into the deep-end of it. First off, in the credits there’s a section under the title of “Name (Rough Sketch)”, but what exactly entailed for this position? Both your name, as well as the established mangaka Misturo Kubo are both listed under this “Name” title, rather than the more traditional “screenplay”. Could you tell us why it is that you chose to work under this title? Well, I originally sat down and thought about the structure and plot of the series; following this myself and Ms. Kubo worked out the details for episodes 1 - 5. From episode 6 onwards however, it was a totally different dimension (laughs). In the Grand Prix, we wanted to have at least six skaters go up against each other. The actual episode of the series ran for about 20 minutes and 10 seconds, with the actual short programs running for about 2 minutes and 50 seconds, while the free programs would run for 4 minutes and 30 seconds. When we ordered the music, we reduced the length of it to about 2 minutes. In a bid to keep all of the elements from the skating program, we had our choreographer Kenji Miyamoto make adjustments to transitions and spins so it would all fit the cut. Even then, we still had to make it shorter; this is where we decided how many minutes each character would skate, we pretty much calculated absolutely everything. Then both Ms. Kubo and I decided on the key elements we wanted to incorporate into each episode, and would write them into the plot. After all these discussions, this was the point in which Ms. Kubo would start writing the names. When comparing a “name” to a “script”, the sketches are kind of like stage directions. It’s as if each drawing or sketch represented a different movement or scene. As a matter of fact, these “names” were the script. Try not to overthink it though, it’s essentially just the same thing as a regular script… (laughs). Given the nature of “names” however, they actually helped a whole lot when we began drawing details such as facial expressions for the characters. Generally when an anime is created, it’s based on a pre-existing manga series or light novel, making it a little easier to work with. With “Yuri!!! on ICE” however, there was no source manga to be used as a basis. So the thought of you bringing on board a manga artist to work with you on an original anime was quite revolutionary. Where was it this idea came from? When I first thought of the project, I was considering working together with a screenwriter, thus taking the traditional route. I quickly realized however that screenwriters are typically working on multiple projects simultaneously, so I felt as though it would be difficult to find someone who could dedicate all their time and think about figure skating as seriously as myself (laughs). Right around that time, I was avidly listening to a radio show called “All Night Nippon”, which featured both Ms. Kubo and Mineko Noumachi. Even though I was just a listener, I always thought I could probably become good friends with Ms. Kubo (laughs). Eventually I heard her talk about figure skating on the radio, and I thought her perspective was extremely interesting. I knew she had contributed to the 2011 film “Moteki” as a screenwriter in the same “name” format we utilized. However, after doing some further research, I found out she had been writing for “Shonen Magazine” here in Japan for quite some time. It was after this discovery that I started to picture her writing scripts for a TV series. Admittedly, it was also a huge bonus to know that she was experienced in making manga based on novels as well. I had this idea that she must be accustomed to collaborating and creating various projects with others. Were you acquainted with Ms. Kubo from the beginning? No, not at all. I had previously made a PV for Japanese singer/songwriter Yasuyuki Okamura, and at the time Ms. Kubo was writing creating special manga boards as a bonus with Okamura’s releases. At a later point, I was invited for drinks with Mr. Okamura, and I mentioned me listening to Ms. Kubo on the radio, where he then mentioned him having her contact information (laughs). I guess you could say that my first real contact with Ms. Kubo was through this discussion with Mr. Okamura. “Yuri!!! on ICE” has been met with much praise internationally, and not just because of it’s figure skating theme. It features a diverse cast of foreign characters throughout the anime, and whilst that isn’t exactly very special in and of itself, it’s believed that they were drawn and animated extremely naturally. It isn’t exactly something that is done often in Japan, so was this done with a certain demographic in mind? Actually, we weren’t thinking about a market demographic at all (laughs). It’s impossible to write about figure skating without depicting foreign characters, which is how that happened. What I always wanted to do was recreate and depict the stories of the top class skaters in each seasons final competitions. So it was kind of inevitable that the setting would take place on a global scale. I went to the Figure Skating Championships which was held in the Czech Republic this past January and happened to see a spectator in cosplay. They were minding their own business, but I saw them in the hallways dressed like Victor. I accidentally yelled out “Wow! It’s Victor!” and they ended up hearing me, so they asked if I wanted to take a photo with them. I answered yes, and we ended up taking a picture together. I asked if they knew “Yuri!!! on ICE” and they said they knew about the show (laughs). Later on I saw the same person at the station, but this time they were dressed as Otabek… waiting and sitting there, just like Otabek would. It was really cute honestly. It’s almost like there’s a totally different feeling when interacting with foreign fans, right? Exactly! It wasn’t like they were jokingly going to the tournament wearing an outfit that just happened to look like cosplay either. I was completely overwhelmed with joy when I realized that people were starting to take interest in the sport of figure skating because they watched “Yuri!!! on ICE”. I’m sure you’re aware, but I’m not necessarily promoting the wearing of cosplay at figure skating tournaments. We wouldn’t want to distract the competitors, would we? (Laughs) Since this was the first ever anime to revolve around the world of figure skating, there must have been quite a few challenges. After all, animating figure skating would appear to be an incredibly difficult process. Did MAPPA know what they were getting themselves into right from the early proposal stages of the project? You know, there’s no real guarantee that any original anime will be a success. I realize how difficult it can be just to get a proposal through, but I thought that if I ever made something, I would just throw it out there regardless of how reckless it may seem (laughs). I believe it’s important that when proposing such an idea, you take a moment to think and verbalize as many interesting ideas as you possibly can. As for whether or not the production staff were aware of the difficulty of the figure skating scenes, we had already given the work orders for the songs and the choreography during the series construction stage, so I’m sure they were aware. There were moments however where I was asked to reduce some aspects during production when the team were struggling to get the work done. How was the planning originally decided? It was around the year 2012 when I started having these desires to make an anime about figure skating. I was previously the director for a project called “Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine’, and it was during that process that I decided my next animated project would be about something I truly care about, which was of course figure skating. There were often times when people would approach me and ask if I had any original ideas, and when I would suggest a figure skating anime, they would typically reject the thought (laughs). Usually they’d simply shake their head due to the sheer difficulty of such a project. I’d also get a lot of questions regarding whether it would be a “student figure skating club”. When talking about modern anime that share similar themes, such as “Yowamushi Pedal” and “Haikyuu!!”, it’s not often that you’ll see professionals of the sport being drawn, but I think that’s just the style of anime. With this work however, you flipped that convention on its head, and I think we all found that extremely interesting. Thank you very much! When you’re in the process of planning an anime, you get a large amount of pressure to make the main characters young, and if the story is set in a modern time, they inevitably leads to the character being a student. I think that’s why a lot of the people who aren’t interested in figure skating thought this would be about a school club. On top of that, I feel as though people thought it would be easier to simply jump on the bandwagon of previous anime that have found success with amateur sports clubs. I also had a lot of people telling me that the series wouldn’t find success if it wasn’t based in Japan, and that nobody would follow it if the characters didn’t have Japanese names. But my usual reply was “Huh? What’s makes you think that?” (laughs). Looking back now, I think that “Yuri!!! on Ice” was the result of me ignoring all this “advice”, and simply making an anime that I myself would enjoy watching -- the story of a character who has already matured and is taking on their final skating season, not some story about a character who is just getting started. I feel as though that would make conveying my ideal image so much more difficult. So when I shared the idea of “Yuri!!! on ICE” with everyone, people said “If you have more matches, we’d have to draw more skaters and that’d make things even more complicated!” (laughs). I couldn’t even get a nod or a “That sounds interesting.”, but I was absolutely determined to create something incredible. If I tried creating something that people would simply “like”, it’d end up being nothing but commonplace and mundane. What kept me motivated through the whole process was the inspiration I received from actual figure skaters while watching their matches. Even when their retirement could be just around the corner, they’d continue to keep fighting and challenging themselves -- that compassion for what they loved really stuck with me. That’s why I first came up with the idea of Yuri and Victor; a skater on the edge of retirement and a world champion who becomes his coach, all while remaining both his hero and rival. It almost seems like you were on some sort of lifelong mission to turn your passion for figure skating into an anime. Was there any particular moment that triggered this? During the production process for “Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine”, Japan was devastated by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, and then immediately after that, one of my relatives passed away. My mental state was a total disaster. Usually as a director, there’s a certain element that drives you to create something interesting based on what you’re given, but I’d lost any emotional capacity to do that. I started to think to myself that it would be impossible to pull anything great out of someone else’s idea. It was at this point I realized I needed to create something from the heart, and for me that was figure skating. I’ve heard there’s a lot of writers and creators in the industry who are afraid to apply the things they truly like into their works.​ I hear that quite often too, the belief that you shouldn’t bring the things you like into your work. I had actually forgotten all about this, but the reason it was important for me to turn my figure skating passion into an anime was that doing anything else would have been impossible. The process of creating anime has become a really tough operation for me as of late. It was like I was creating, yet at the same time I was beating myself to death over it. My hands moved slow, and I would force myself to stay awake just in order to finish a project on time. So I thought to myself that I needed to work on a topic that I would never grow tired of, something that would keep me awake all day. Otherwise, I don’t think I could have ever made another anime, all while thinking “Someday I’m going to make something I like” (laughs). A woman talented well beyond her years, Sayo Yamamoto is a model example of just what the Japanese animation industry needs. We continue to expand upon this in the second part of the interview which will be made available in the near future. A preview of the second part is featured in our 'Yuri!!! on ICE' film announcement piece, which was made available here.

Today we sat down with rising Japanese talent YUC'e ahead of her major performance. |You’re tuning into OTAQUEST, and this, is ‘Welcome to the Neon District’. With North America’s biggest anime convention just around the corner, we’re going to be introducing you to the headline acts that will be taking over the Anime Expo 2017 main stage during the conventions all-new premiere event, Neon District. Coming from a diverse roster of musical backgrounds, the 2017 lineup consists of several veterans of the international musical scenes, all of whom are absolute masters of their craft. But before you see them live, it’s tremendously important you know the basics about them; so without further ado, let’s get started:​ As a musician, YUC'e stands for an incredibly diverse new sound that's been emerging from Tokyo's ever-growing underground music scene as of late. Gone are the days where big-name labels had to be involved, ushering in a wave of youth who legitimately just enjoy making the sounds they do as a form of self-expression. Excelling in composition, arrangement, production and mixing, you'll often find YUC'e taking over the clubs of Japan with her infectiously adorable sounds. Beginning her musical career in 2015, we've been able to watch the astounding growth of an artist, and Neon District is only the start of her international success. In her earlier years, YUC'e studied internationally in the United States, and now she's making her way back once more. Chances are you may know her for her 2016 breakthrough track 'Future Candy', which even to this day remains an essential listen. With an entire catalog of releases behind her, as well as a whole list of live experience, we absolutely can't wait to see YUC'e perform live at Neon District! We had the unique opportunity to sit down with YUC'e herself ahead of her performance at Neon District, where we discussed her history as a cover artist, followed by eventually becoming a producer, as well as what we can expect to see from her performance at the event. The interview can be found in full below: As an artist you began your career online creating vocal covers of well known anime songs. Just a few short years later you would go on to create an entire career for yourself surrounding your original production and vocals. Can you tell us a little bit about this journey? I enjoy expressing myself using my voice, which was originally what got me into doing vocal covers. I love anime, so it of course made sense for me to sing anime songs. (Laughs) That being said, I felt like I could do something more to express myself, which is when I launched myself into the world of doujin music. I began working as a lyricist, vocalist and producer on my own tracks, but throughout the whole process, I’ve always felt that “I’m creating this for the purpose of expression”. I feel like it’s because of this belief that I’m as active as I am now. This isn’t the first time you’ve made your way over to the US this year; from your last trip, did you learn anything that you plan to apply to your live performance at this years Neon District? It really feels like a miracle to be able to visit the United States twice in the same year, truly. I’m super happy about it; during my last performance it was my first international live, and I was really nervous because of it. But in the United States I came to realize that I need to have more fun with my songs. I would like to have fun musically alongside everyone else at Neon District! Your major breakthrough track was undeniably Future Candy, which still to this day has been on constant repeat in my head. That track also received a lot of domestic attention here in Japan, especially from artists such as Kors K and the doujin scene. Can you tell us a little bit about what made that song so distinct? Future Candy was actually my first time creating a future bass track. For a track with club-sounds in mind, I was able to get it done pretty quickly. In the past my songs were made to be a little more serene, as well as filled with vocal tracks. But because I wanted to make more fun music that could be played at club events, this is where I found myself! Having so many people listen to this song, as well as so many people dancing along, it makes me really happy! You’re an individual who is constantly evolving as a creative, with absolutely no signs of slowing down. You’ve conquered the domestic doujin market, and have even broken through internationally as a musician, but what do you think the next big step is for you? A lot of popular artists will often encounter a “wall”, something that blocks them from progressing. So I don’t encounter such issues, I want to do my best to be properly arranged as an artist. I want to be able to do more and more live events not just in Japan, but internationally as well! Finally, Is there anything you want to say to your fans in the US ahead of your performance at Anime Expo’s Neon District? Let’s all have fun together! I’m seriously excited, and I just can’t wait for the big night! Let’s all do our best!

Announced by Bandai-Namco, Little Witch Academia: Toki no Maho to Nana Fushigi is an action RPG meant to serve as a side story in the Little Witch Academia universe. Akko and friends appear to be on a mission to uncover the seven wonders of Luna Nova Magical Academy. The game will be released in Japan before year's end, on November 30. No Western release has been announced as of yet, so it remains to be seen what kind of localization choices will be made in regards to the game's title. As is, the title translates to Little Witch Academia: The Magic of Time and the Seven Wonders. Let's revisit the game's original trailer, immediately followed by a new teaser revealed this week containing even more of that beautiful, beautiful gameplay footage. Now, for the juicy details -- The game's creators have made a special point of faithfully translating Studio Trigger's expressive style into a gorgeous, 3D framework; and boy, is that ever apparent. My favorite scene is likely from the first trailer, where we can see Akko sneaking up on a group of her classmates to eavesdrop on their conversation. The subtle nodding and the shrewd look in her eyes - where does the anime end and the game begin? As if it weren't already good-looking enough, the second trailer reveals that Studio Trigger is in fact contributing brand-new, game exclusive anime cutscenes. A collector's edition of the game is also set to drop, containing a hard-stock box with illustrations by Studio Trigger, a bonus content Blu-ray disc, a character drama CD, an artbook, and a special Chariot Card. Peek the goods below. The key artwork for the game, naturally also illustrated by Trigger, is a treat for the eyes as well. "The story of these witches aiming for the future is not over." Being that the 2017 Little Witch Academia received no small boost from Netflix, I would hazard to guess that it won't be too long before we hear an official announcement regarding the game leaving Japan soon. In the meantime, hold onto those witch's hats, because this one is going to be magical.

Curiously, the European model will not include the USB power cable for juicing the unit, but I suppose we have a ton of those lying around anyway. What the European version will feature, however, is the original design of the console, akin to the Japanese Super Famicom. By the way, as of this writing, no Super Famicom Mini has been announced for the Japanese market. Of course, also as of this writing, it is 2:00 am JST, and those guys are likely engaging in some well-deserved sleep. Expect that announcement in a few hours.

The game was fully completed, but its release was cancelled due to the impending launch of the company's own Nintendo 64 console, which sported much-advanced 3D graphics. Nintendo were afraid of hurting Star Fox 2's chances on the market while it looked to be the graphically inferior experience. Nintendo have definitely included quite the compelling reason to pick this little machine up. Let's just hope that we don't see the same supply constraints for this model worldwide.

11265|2017-06-27|00:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/doraemon-quality-boost/| News | N/A | Long-Running "Doraemon" Anime to Receive Quality Boost | Though it may have never reached intense levels of popularity in the United States or Europe, the Doraemon series has been a cornerstone of the childhoods... |Though it may have never reached intense levels of popularity in the United States or Europe, the Doraemon series has been a cornerstone of the childhoods of many in Japan and even the rest of Asia. Seemingly like clockwork, every year during the first week of March, a new Doraemon film opens in Japanese theaters with a totally new story, mix-ups in staff, animation techniques and even direction. They are a largely separate entity from the TV anime, which has been running in its current form since the year 2005. It's nice to see then, that the beloved TV version of the franchise is about to receive a major boost in overall animation quality, "the likes of which have never been seen before in Doraemon," according to director Shinnosuke Yakuwa. The key changes have been outlined as such by Mantan Web. The series will be moving away from a watercolor motif in background detail, opting instead for a more poster color-inspired look. This will be done to allow more details to flourish in the background overall. The staff acknowledged that this would be a challenge in the production of the TV show, but that the changes will allow them to convey emotion and drama-like storytelling in an even more thorough fashion. Also coming are subtle changes to the way the characters are animated, as the staff wish to draw the characters with more natural pose and expression found in many works of modern animation. All of this will be accomplished through the addition of some new key staff members, including Shinnosuke Yakuwa as director and producer, who previously directed the 2016 movie Doraemon: Nobita and the Birth of Japan. Also joining the crew is Yoshiro Osugi as chief director. He previously handled directorial duties for 2015's Doraemon: Nobita's Space Heroes. If you have ever been interested in watching the adventures of the adorable blue cat and his endless array of future space gadgets, a good place to start may be checking out Disney XD's streaming channel in the US! Yes, the show has been pushed in Western markets, albeit with some slight changes to character names and such in the Disney version, likely for easy consumption by American kids.

11264|2017-06-27|00:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/vr-zone-shinjuku/| News | N/A | VR Gaming Heaven is Coming to Tokyo | VR ZONE SHINJUKU is opening in Tokyo later next month. Starting July 14, you'll be able to experience over 15 unique VR experiences. | Ever since getting my first taste of an honest-to-goodness virtual reality game at this year's BitSummit in Kyoto, I've become a believer that this is one of the many paths entertainment can take towards becoming that much more immersive. One thing that does leave me a little skeptical however is the spatial requirements of the average consumer, especially here in Japan where the average living room can be noticeably smaller. We've been seeing the technology catch-on regardless though, thanks to the efforts of a few companies constructing large, public spaces for VR tech, accompanied with interesting and wondrously-immersive software. This newest installment by Bandai-Namco is about to blow them all out of the water. VR ZONE SHINJUKU is opening in Kabukicho - a prominent entertainment district in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo. Starting July 14, you can expect to have access to over 15 unique VR experiences. Definitely check out the video below for a small teaser of what to expect. Let's tally up the official list of experiences, shall we? Dragon Ball VR - Master the Kamehameha Hanechari (Winged Bicycle) Mario Kart Arcade GP VR Evangelion VR: The Throne of Souls Dinosaur Survival Run Jungle of Despair Fishing VR GIJIESTA Armored Trooper Votoms Battling Dudes Argyle Shift Gundam VR Daiba Assault Extreme Courage Test Machine Fear of Heights: The Show Immersive Horror Room Hospital Escape Omega Steep Downhill Ski Simulator Ski Rodeo Futuristic Warfare Arena Ghost in the Shell: Arise Stealth Hounds Giant Balloon Burst Room PANIC CUBE Virtual Resort Activity Trap climbing/Niagara drop Clearly, one of the activities that we're the most excited for is Evangelion VR: The Throne of Souls, as we've already spoken a bit about it. Now that we've seen some footage of that game in action, it won't take any prodding from a mean scientist dad with cool glasses to get us into the robot. Rounding off the other anime-inspired activities are Dragon Ball VR - Master the Kamehameha, Argyle Shift, and Gundam VR Daiba Assault. We truly are one step closer to that 2D world reality...only you know, in 3D. Oh, and Mario, buddy? Slow down a little. Bring that Kart to a halt. We can't have too many amazing Mario Kart games clustered so close together. We're still trying to tear ourselves away from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Oh well - I think I can safely speak for most in saying that it's time to plan a VR-centric trip to Japan if you were looking for that perfect time to visit. For even more info, check out the official announcement below: BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc. (HQ: Minato-ku, Tokyo, President & CEO: Satoshi Oshita) will open the largest VR entertainment facility in Japan, “VR ZONE SHINJUKU”, in Shinjuku Kabukicho Tokyo on Friday 14th July. Reservations will be available from Friday 16th June, 12:00PM (JST). Building upon the success of its predecessor “VR ZONE Project i Can”, VR ZONE SHINJUKU will house over 15 activities. VR ZONE SHINJUKU will also include a wide range of new non-IP VR activities where guests will be able to experience exploring a fantasy world on a winged bicycle, a horror-filled dinosaur survival run, and much more. Every activity is designed for the guests to lose themselves in the immersive VR experience. Guests will also be able to enjoy a variety of non VR activities, such as surviving from an expanding giant balloon in a locked cell, purchasing original souvenirs, and enjoy meals and activities in a virtually simulated resort themed dining space, making for a truly well-rounded entertainment experience. In addition, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc. has teamed up with the popular digital art group NAKED to develop projection mapping installations in and out of the facility. The exterior will feature a projection of PAC-MAN among other images, while the inside will feature a ‘Centre Tree’ posing as the interface of the facility which will allow guests to interact with the building itself through touch. According to Yoshiyasu Horiuchi, Executive Officer of the Amusement Business Unit for BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc., the company plans to install their VR activities in over 20 locations worldwide in order to increase the opportunities for a larger audience to enjoy their VR entertainment. “VR ZONE SHINJUKU will be the flagship location for the next-generation of entertainment,” said Executive Officer Yoshiyasu Horiuchi. “A place where BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc. carries out new challenges, delivers excitement and amazement to visitors from across the globe.” You'll want to keep an eye on the official website for that all-important reservation system! Best of all, the website is even available in English!|

Each piece follows a similar trend, featuring an adorable simple illustration style accompanied by a flat canvas. It's been stated by OMOCAT that the whole collection was done using a trackpad while simply hanging out with friends, which is likely where all the positive vibes came from. The whole collection is gorgeous from start to finish, and with the growing prevalence of OMOCAT as a fashion brand here in Japan, it's exciting to see residents of Tokyo being able to pick up the look. With the official Summer 2017 collection just four days away in the US, one can only hope it finds its way to Japan before things get too cold. 国内ではPARKでのみお取扱中の人気海外クリエイターOMOCATの2017SPRING COLLECTIONがお店に届きました〜 今回のラインナップはいつもと少しテイストが異なりまた違うかわいさ 本日より店頭販売開始です‼️(通販は準備中ですので少しお待ちください) pic.twitter.com/VPsHp66OEH — PARK (@PARK_HARAJUKU) 26 June 2017 PARK Harajuku have been a staple part of Harajuku for the better part of the last five years. They're the melting pot between internet-culture, anime-culture and fashion-culture, and are one of my favorite stores in all of Tokyo to pick up new clothing from. Everything that is made available at PARK Harajuku represents a real aspect of the districts ever-evolving culture, and that's part of what makes it so special. Originally started with the goal of making independent sellers clothing commercially available at a physical storefront rather than just an online store, PARK has rapidly evolved, and now finds itself as a main-fixture on Harajuku's world-renowned Takashita Street within the 2.5D SPINNS building. The store even has it's own manga series published through Crunchyroll, with their own anime on the way. On the flip-side however, OMOCAT is a California-based artist who rapidly rose to prominence both IRL and URL for their vibrantly illustrated clothing collections, alongside their instant sell-out appearances at conventions across the United States. With their clothing made available in both the US and Japan, they've rapidly been expanding and continue to find their footing in new places. With their Summer 2017 collection set to make it's debut just a day before Anime Expo 2017, we can't wait to see what goodies they have in stock for the Los Angeles convention. OMOCAT has been stocked at PARK Harajuku for as long as I remember, and it's always a treat to take friends there and see their reactions when they see OMOCAT pieces on display.

11268|2017-06-26|10:45|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/neon-district-teddyloid/| Interview | N/A | Welcome to the Neon District: TeddyLoid | You’re tuning into OTAQUEST, and this, is ‘Welcome to the Neon District’. With North America’s biggest anime convention just around the corner, we’re... |You’re tuning into OTAQUEST, and this, is ‘Welcome to the Neon District’. With North America’s biggest anime convention just around the corner, we’re going to be introducing you to the headline acts that will be taking over the Anime Expo 2017 main stage during the conventions all-new premiere event, Neon District. Coming from a diverse roster of musical backgrounds, the 2017 lineup consists of several veterans of the international musical scenes, all of whom are absolute masters of their craft. But before you see them live, it’s tremendously important you know the basics about them; so without further ado, let’s get started: Jump-starting his musical career at just 18-years of age, TeddyLoid would proceed to work alongside acclaimed Japanese singer/song-writer MIYAVI as his DJ and sound producer. Moving forward from that however, TeddyLoid set his eyes on the rapidly evolving anime industry as his next big target. He produced the soundtrack for Gainax's "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt" alongside Taku Takahashi, then would later go on to work on series such as "Mekakucity Actors" and "Space Patrol Luluco". In 2014, Teddyloid would then work alongside fellow musician Daoko to create the viral-hit "ME!ME!ME!" which again launched him into the international spotlight. Making his debut as a solo artist, TeddyLoid would release his first solo album "UNDER THE BLACK MOON" through King Records' own EVIL LINE RECORDS in August of 2014. Just over a year later, he triumphantly returned with his new collaborative remix album alongside Momoiro Clover Z aptly titled "Re:MOMOIRO CLOVER Z". TeddyLoid is a genre-defining artist who has made waves domestically for his works alongside numerous industry legends such as Tetsuya Komuro, Yasutaka Nakata, Ko Shibasaki and KOHH. We had the unique opportunity to sit down with TeddyLoid himself ahead of his performance at Neon District, where we discussed his history as a producer in the anime industry, as well as what we can expect to see from his performance at the event. The interview can be found in full below: This will be your second year as a guest of honor at Anime Expo, following your performance last year; what is it about the Los Angeles crowd that keeps drawing you back? I've always wanted to participate at Anime Expo, and last year I was given the enormous opportunity to do so. Even though I was the only DJ from Japan last year, there was a connection from the whole crowd that had them singing and shouting along to my music -- I feel like that really made the show incredible. There were a lot of people in attendance who were fans of my works, and that left me feeling really great. At the same time however, I couldn't help but feel a little bad; we ended up having more people than we could have ever predicted trying to come in, and staff had to eventually limit the amount of people that could enter. This year however, we've got a much larger venue, so I hope to see both new and returning faces! Your live sets are always an eclectic blend of electronic sounds sprinkled with your own originals; what can we expect to see during this year's performance? I'll be re-creating a wide roster of anime songs in a way that I know will rile up the entire audience. Oh, and I'll also definitely be playing "the song" that I'm sure you're all looking forward to, and I can't wait to see everyone in the crowd react! I hope you're all looking forward to it as much as I am! Your initial major international hit was Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt’s ‘Fly Away’, a song which still to this day defines the anime club scene. Following that was the release of ‘ME!ME!ME!’, which once again launched you into the global limelight. Has your musical style changed much since then? I began to realize that more and more people were listening to my music from all around the world, which was an incredibly surreal experience for me. When I first started the "TeddyLoid" project, I was quite conscious about wanting to perform internationally, so seeing that I could place as the 5th most-listened to Japanese artist on Spotify really helped give me courage to try a wide-variety of different approaches. What was the process for working on the ‘ME!ME!ME!’ music video? Did you have any creative input on that, or was it entirely created around a song you had already produced? Both the director Mr. Yoshizaki, as well as the animator Shuichi Iseki sent me through a constant stream of storyboards and rough animation clips, to which I would continue to create sounds around. I would try and line each and every sound up with whatever cut was currently happening within the video, while at the same time at their end they would also be lining everything up... It was kind of like a musical session. What surprised me the most within the whole process was our featured singer DAOKO. I sent her through the demo track, and she immediately wrote the lyrics, recorded them, and sent her demo back to me the next morning. Usually in the music production process, we would go through with recording after a demo is produced, but because of how up-lifting her initial piece was, we decided to roll with it and lightly edit it along the way. Is there anything you want to say to your fans in the US ahead of your performance at Anime Expo’s Neon District? I'm so proud to be playing Anime Expo for the second year in a row. It's because of all my listeners all around the world, and I can't thank you enough for all your support. I'm sincerely looking forward to seeing everyone at the show, so again, please do look forward to it!

11269|2017-06-26|08:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/kirara-fantasia-announcement/| News | N/A | "Kirara Fantasia" Brings Together a World of Moe Characters | Japanese manga magazine Manga Time Kirara has played host to many of the recent year's most popular moe anime and manga titles. |Japanese manga magazine Manga Time Kirara has played host to many of the recent year's most popular moe anime and manga titles. Are you a fan of Hidamari Sketch, Magic of Stella, New Game!, Yuyushiki, School-Live!, Kin-iro Mosaic, Urara Meirocho, or A Channel? Well here's a fun fact, each and every one of them appeared in one of five different version of the Manga Time Kirara magazine at some point. So when it was announced that characters from each property will be coming together for a big adventure of enormously cute proportions, I understandably couldn't help but get a little excited. The publisher for Manga Time Kirara, Houbunsha revealed the game during the enormous Manga Time Kirara Festa! 2017 event. Taking part in the celebrations were fans, staff, voice actors, and an endless bounty of enviable merchandise for what could have only been one of Japan's cutest conventions to date. The surprise bombshell adds yet another mobage-style RPG to our growing games folder, and sends some of the most popular characters out on an enormous adventure together. Check out the announcement video below for a good idea of what to expect: The free-to-play mobage, which is being developed in collaboration by Drecom and Meteorise, is being billed "Manga Time Kirara meets Fantasy RPG." Kin-iro Mosaic's Karen as a knight, New Game!'s Aoba as a mage - everyone together questing their way to the top? Sure, I'm sure I could spare a few yen for cosmetic purposes (only items will cost you that real-life gold). Noticeably missing from the lineup of titles and characters are the cast of Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? (Is the Order a Rabbit), easily one of the magazine's most popular franchises. I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say that the title will receive representation in Kirara Fantasia going forward however. For even more fun, you may want to check out the official 4-panel manga for the game leading up to its release. It is being drawn by Manga Time Kirara artist Arima, and can be found here. There is currently no concrete release date for the game outside of simply "2017," and there has been no announcement regarding a release outside of Japan. With how the way these things go sometimes however, I'd be readying that Japanese App Store or Google Play account if I were you. That being said however, we did just get Fate/Grand Order however, a game that the me of 2 years ago would have never seen coming. For further information, be sure to check out the games official website, here. It's also worth checking out the official Twitter account, where we're sure you'll be able to get a friendly dose of adorable characters posted into your feed, here.

11271|2017-06-25|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/galaxxxy-10th-anniversary/| News | N/A | Our 10 Favorite Galaxxxy Releases for Their 10th Anniversary | If you're somehow not at all familiar with the Shibuya-based fashion brand Galaxxxy, I hope you're ready for a real treat. |One of my all time favorite Japanese fashion brands are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year, and in celebration we'll be taking a look back at some of their all-time best designs. If you're not at all familiar with the Shibuya-based brand Galaxxxy, I hope you're ready for a real treat. They're one of the most stylistically diverse brands to ever grace the streets of Tokyo, and we're totally in love with them. Throughout their tremendous 10-year lifespan, they've collaborated with some of the biggest names in multiple industries; including Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Porter Robinson, Sushio (Studio TRIGGER), and a multitude of others. These collaborations, as well as their incredible line-up of original pieces have gone on to shape many views of the over-the-top styles that bless the streets of Harajuku, and it's such a treat to see them hit such a milestone. Before we get too into things however, let's take a look at the history of Galaxxxy as a company. Galaxxxy is a Japanese fashion brand, influenced by a scattered virtual world of past and future music, anime, street wear, and net culture. Originally launched in February 2007, the brand teamed up with numerous big-name classic anime such as Creamy Mami, Dragon Ball, and Sailor Moon. They were an instant hit, pulling at the strings of childhood nostalgia mixed with the vibrant colors of a pastel landscape. Putting on a piece of Galaxxxy clothing feels like a departure from the current decade, completing your look with a hyper-stylistic flare ripped straight from the '80s. More recently we've seen a push from them in international territories, with extensive appearances at conventions across North America, as well as international online stores for most regions. [%-iFOBJ:ADBLOCK:iFOBJ-%] In no particular order, let's get looking at the top 10 Galaxxxy pieces from their 10-year lifetime (Well, the top 10 pieces in my opinion): Galaxxxy x Dr. Slump Collaboration 2015 Summer Collection Starting off our list is the absolutely adorable Galaxxxy x Dr. Slump collaborative pieces that features the 'Arale' name, alongside an adorable pastel flurry of well, poop. The whole collection contained so many outstanding looks, but of them all, these pieces in particular stood out the most. Like most pre-2017 Galaxxxy pieces, these came exclusively in a 'one-size-fits-all' solution, making them a little less friendly to international fans. That being said, it's most definitely an amazing ode to an incredible series, and it without a doubt deserves its place on this top 10. Galaxxxy Band-Aid Parka 2014 Fall Collection There are so many things I can say about this entire collection, but holding me back is the knowledge deep down inside that I'll likely never be able to get my hands on one. The Galaxxxy Band-Aid Parka is one of the single greatest looks in the history of Harajuku/Shibuya fashion, period. There's so many things that it does right, which also makes it one of the most actively sought after pieces. Sigh. Galaxxxy Game Center Hoodie 2014 Winter Collection An absolute classic release in so many ways, the Galaxxxy Game Center Hoodie was a retro throwback to the distant arcades of ones childhood. It was an absolutely striking piece from all angles, and the additional bonbon on top totally completed the look. It's been a key-component to a lot of visually pleasing outfits, and it's because of that very reason that it's managed to find itself a cozy place in our top 10 collection. Galaxxxy 8 Words Wall Paint Jacket 2015 Autumn/Winter Collection You can't say Galaxxxy without the 8 Words jacket immediately popping into your mind. It's an absolutely incredible piece, and quite possibly one of my favorites to date (though I'm still struggling to pick one up on aftermarket auctions). Likely pulling inspiration from the graffiti lining the streets of Shibuya, we're presented with a all-over perfect piece that uses mayhem as it's basis. Originally released in 2015, things didn't get much warmer than this jacket. Galaxxxy x Sega Dreamcast Controller Backpack 2013 Summer Collection Quite possibly one of Galaxxxy's most known collaborations, the Sega Dreamcast bag is an absolutely gorgeous accessory to any outfit. On top of it being a fully functional backpack, it also touts major homage to what is viewed by many to be one of the best Sega consoles to date (and evidently their last). It was available in three colors, and was actually made available again earlier this year in a limited-edition rerun of the collection. Galaxxxy x Kyary Pamyu Pamyu Dino-chan Sweater 2012 Winter Collection Sometimes the best pieces are the simplest pieces, and that's most definitely the case with this collaboration between Galaxxxy and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. The sweaters, which feature Galaxxxy mascot Dino-chan, are an ever-adorable piece of history that compliment just about anything. Staying warm had never been this cute, and the well-constructed mix of pastels made this all the easier. Galaxxxy x Sushio (TRIGGER) Ginga Sushi T-Shirt 2017 Summer Collection One of the most recent releases from Galaxxxy, as well as a piece that's readily available internationally, I'm totally in love with this collaboration. Showcasing the talents of one of the animation industries most capable illustrators, Studio TRIGGER's own Sushio, we're given a look at an action-packed scenario jammed entirely onto a t-shirt. It's vibrant, it's colorful, and I totally love it. Galaxxxy x Gainax Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt Figures 2012 Spring Collection Perhaps one of the best collaborative pieces that Galaxxxy have ever done is surprisingly enough not a piece of clothing, but rather, these incredible Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt figures. Putting the signature Galaxxxy-spin on both Panty and Stocking, we're presented with these pieces of PVC eye-candy. These days you'll usually see these figures going online for roughly $150 USD, which isn't too bad given how collectible they are. I'm definitely keeping my eyes on them, but maybe I'll jump when I get a bigger desk. Galaxxxy Manga Blouson 2015/16 Winter Collection Made available in two colors, both black and white, then later re-released due to popularity, the manga blouson is a must-have for any fan of Galaxxxy who are looking to stay warm in the Winter months. It features an iconic design paired with visually appealing imagery. Much like any good manga panel, it feels like the whole thing just jumps out at you, and I simply can't get over how good of a piece it is. Galaxxxy x Porter Robinson Worlds T-Shirt 2015 Fall Collection We all knew it was coming, but there's absolutely no way we could discontinue just how great the Porter Robinson collaboration still is to this day. It's a simple long-cut t-shirt featuring various imagery from his debut album 'Worlds' that released a year prior. On the back you'll find both the musicians name, as well as the name of the album in both Japanese and English utilizing a really neat neon design. If there was any collaboration that made the Galaxxxy name known internationally, this would have to be it. Each and every one of these pieces are an accurate look into the world of Japan's incredible underground fashion scene. Taking cues from a variety of different places, Galaxxxy never fails to impress with their stylistically pleasing clothing. With this year being the brands 10th anniversary, they're going to be throwing an open-celebration at Anime Expo 2017, and we're extremely excited to see how it all plays out. Taking place in the VIP lounge at The Novo, attendees will be able to interact and hang out with the Galaxxxy team. Tickets are available for $10 each, and can be purchased online, here. Thank you Galaxxxy for keeping the streets colorful for the past ten years, and we wish you all the best for the next ten!|10th anniversary, Anime Expo, Creamy Mami, Dragon Ball, Galaxxxy, Inferno Cop, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Panty & Stocking, porter robinson, Studio TRIGGER, Sushio
11272|2017-06-25|09:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/hero-academia-second-cour/| News | N/A | "My Hero Academia" Is Getting Seriously Interesting | Uploaded onto TOHO Animation's official YouTube channel this week, we're given our first look at the new opening theme for "My Hero Academia". |With the start of each now season comes a whole roster of new anime, as well as a handful of noteworthy returning anime. It's a cycle that keeps us on our toes, and it also acts as the perfect opportunity for those returning shows to change things up a little. So with the summer season just around the corner, I don't think I could be any more prepared for the plus ultra second cour to one of this decades greatest anime, "My Hero Academia". Uploaded onto TOHO Animation's official YouTube channel this week, we're given our first look at the high-impact 'Field Training Arc', as well as our first look at the new opening theme. Taking on the massive responsibility will be the ever-mysterious artist amazarashi (Tokyo Ghoul √A, Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace) with his incredible new single "Sora ni Utaeba". It has also been previously announced that conducting the OP theme for the second cour will be LiSA (Sword Art Online, Nisekoi, Mekakucity Actors) which I'm personally extremely excited about. The PV also showcases some of the post-credit scenes from the latest episode, as well as some new unseen footage from the upcoming arc. It can be streamed in full below: It's been an honest while since I've been this excited for a new cour to start, but I'm not surprised that My Hero Academia would be the one to make me feel this way. If you're not at all familiar with the anime, it's an extremely wholesome, action-packed series about giving it your all, plus ultra! Possibly one of the freshest series to come from Shonen Jump in quite some time, it's left us all hanging on the edge of our seats with each and every closing sequence.

11273|2017-06-24|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/neon-district-ram-rider/| Interview | N/A | Welcome to the Neon District: Ram Rider | We sat down with Ram Rider ahead of his performance at Neon District, where we discussed what we can expect to see from his showcase at the event. |You’re tuning into OTAQUEST, and this, is ‘Welcome to the Neon District’. With North America’s biggest anime convention just around the corner, we’re going to be introducing you to the headline acts that will be taking over the Anime Expo 2017 main stage during the conventions all-new premiere event, Neon District. Coming from a diverse roster of musical backgrounds, the 2017 lineup consists of several veterans of the international musical scenes, all of whom are absolute masters of their craft. But before you see them live, it’s tremendously important you know the basics about them; so without further ado, let’s get started: As an artist, Ram Rider began his rapid rise to fame in the mid-90's after releasing a multitude of popular tracks through independent labels, ultimately leading to him remixing an entire catalog of major artists here in Japan. Making the most of his diverse talents in the fields of DJ'ing, producing and arranging, Ram Rider would quickly go on to carve his own niche within the music industry. Moving forward, you'll find Ram Rider working alongside some of Japan's biggest bands and idol groups, with noteworthy acts such as Tempura Kidz even reaching out to him for their greatest hits. Outside of his expansive catalog of 3 original albums, as well as several singles and official remixes, you'll often find Ram Rider's sets filled with a vibrant mix of anime and video game remixes, as well as the underground-defining sounds of Japan's electronic music scene. Setting the scene for Ram Rider's sets are his over-the-top laser and LED shows, following the theme of "Sound and Light". It's absolutely not something you'll want to be missing, and Neon District may just be your best place to check it all out. We had the unique opportunity to sit down with Ram Rider himself ahead of his performance at Neon District, where we discussed his history as a producer, as well as what we can expect to see from his performance at the event. The interview can be found in full below: You started your career as an independent electronic artist in the 90’s, where you rapidly rose to individual success. Do you believe the Japanese music landscape has changed much since then? The constant evolution of DJ gear between the '90s and 2000s was a major catalyst for populating the club music scene. In experiencing the shift between using vinyls to using CD's as a primary tool for playing out music, we were able to express ourselves a lot more through edits and remixes of music through this new simplified process. Rather than pressing vinyl, we simply had to burn a CD from our own computers. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I feel like there was a massive growth among the music producer community. Within this boom, there were a lot of individuals who were extremely conscious of international audiences, and would often cater towards them; sometimes even at the cost of ignoring their own domestic audiences. These days there's endless amounts of incredible production software that can simply be acquired online by anyone, and it's because of this we're witnessing a change in the flow of the industry. People are able to flourish in this environment, and anyone could become the next big name in the music world. It's definitely an extremely exciting era, but it's also quite a difficult one for those who have been in the game for quite some time. (laughs) It's the perfect era to be a young person. Recently you’ve been working closely with more and more external groups such as idols and bands; has this proven to be a challenge, or did it tend to be a natural progression as an electronic artist? There was this massive Electro House boom in the 2000s, and it was kind of a natural course of action for idols and solo artists to utilize these club sounds in their music. That's where I came into the picture, it made a whole lot of sense for me to produce for them, which is how I got involved in that side of the industry. These days, J-pop is going in a wide-variety of directions, it's no longer a simple recipe of creating an EDM or Dubstep track, rather, there has to be a lot more involvement for artists. It can be difficult, but it's also extremely exciting to create these new sounds for artists. Perhaps one of the things you’re most known for internationally is your beautifully constructed anime song remixes. Is there any particular song that stands out to you more than anything else? I've created remixes for NIRGILS' "Sakura", which was the OP for Eureka Seven, "smile again", which was a collaboration with studio 4℃, as well as worked on several anime soundtracks here in Japan. Whenever I'm DJ'ing overseas, I like to bring an iconic mix of various well-known video game and anime soundtracks including titles such as Zelda, Street Fighter 2, Metal Gear Solid, and a whole bunch more. I hope you can all look forward to this! Your live shows are often known for being a laser-filled visual feast for attendees, have you got anything special planned visually for this year’s Neon District show? I'm currently planning to operate a gorgeous laser performance using a giant cube screen in front of my stage. As far as I know, I'm the only one in the world who does this, and I truly believe it's an experience that I hope you can all enjoy. Unfortunately however, we're still trying to work out the logistics of bringing this to the United States, and if it's not possible, I offer my sincere apologies in advance and promise to give it my all in my actual DJ performance! Finally, Is there anything you want to say to your fans in the US ahead of your performance at Anime Expo’s Neon District? Last time I performed at Anime Expo was back in 2013, making this four years since my last performance. This year, I'll have Taku Takahashi, Teddyloid, and banvox sharing the stage with me throughout the night. These three in particular are artists who I often share the stage with here in Tokyo, which I am very excited about. I feel as though this is as close as we can get to a legitimate Tokyo nightlife environment, so I urge everyone to come along and have fun!

11276|2017-06-23|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/neon-district-taku-takahashi/| Interview | N/A | Welcome to the Neon District: Taku Takahashi | You're tuning into OTAQUEST, and this, is 'Welcome to the Neon District'. Today we sit down and chat with Taku Takahashi of m-flo and block.fm fame. |You're tuning into OTAQUEST, and this, is 'Welcome to the Neon District'. With North America's biggest anime convention just around the corner, we're going to be introducing you to the headline acts that will be taking over the Anime Expo 2017 main stage during the conventions all-new premiere event, Neon District. Coming from a diverse roster of musical backgrounds, the 2017 lineup consists of several veterans of the international musical scenes, all of whom are absolute masters of their craft. But before you see them live, it's tremendously important you know the basics about them; so without further ado, let's get started: Taku Takahashi is, without a doubt, one of the most influential artists to come from Japan's ever-expanding music industry in recent history. Beginning his career in 1998 as producer and DJ for the musical group m-flo, he rapidly rose to fame both domestically and internationally for his immense production ability. It didn't take long for Taku to then carve the pathway for his own solo works to flourish, where he would go on to remix several high-profile artists stemming from various backgrounds. Outside of the high-speed realm of the pop and dance music genres, Taku found himself a prominent fixture in the video game and anime industry as a producer for various soundtracks. His extensive backlog includes work with acclaimed studio Gainax's "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt", Shinichiro Watanabe's "Space Dandy", and Square Enix's own "Figureheads". These days you'll find Taku juggling various production jobs, on top of his highly-successful block.fm project, which was established as Japan's first and only Dance Music Radio Station. Pushing the limits of what's conceived to be possible, in late-2016 he began planning and working on OTAQUEST, a project aimed at introducing the underground of Japan's various pop culture circles to global English-speaking audiences. He's been listed as Japan's best DJ two years in a row, and this year you'll be able to catch him totally rocking the Neon District dance floor. Expect things to get a little weird, as Taku spins some of the best that Tokyo's diverse club scene has to offer. We had the unique opportunity to sit down with Taku Takahashi himself ahead of his performance at Neon District, where we discussed his history in the anime industry as a producer, as well as what we can expect to see from his performance at the event. The interview can be found in full below: Since roughly the turn of the century, you’ve played an extremely prominent role in the Japanese music industry through your work with your musical group m-flo, as well as block.fm, Japan’s first dance music internet radio platform and media. Branching away from that however, you conceived the OTAQUEST project towards the end of 2016. Can you tell us a little about why you started OTAQUEST? I originally started m-flo 19 years ago alongside VERBAL in an attempt to try to break the trends of mainstream J-pop. I wanted to introduce the diverse and incredible music being created around the world, and that’s why I started ‘block.fm’ five years ago. Both of these projects were a great success, which lead to me wanting to introduce various aspects of Japanese culture through OTAQUEST. Within my musical career, I’ve been heavily involved in the production of various anime soundtracks. I produced the soundtrack for Studio Gainax’ “Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt” under the alias TCY FORCE, and would later go on to produce music for Shinichiro Watanabe’s “Space Dandy”. It was through this role that I would go on to meet and befriend fellow creative Dai Sato, the main script writer for Eureka Seven. Together with Dai Sato, I intend to show you the real behind-the-scenes side of the anime industry, whilst also focusing on the various cultures surrounding the industry. In 2009 during record label Avex’s 20th anniversary, you featured in a prominent animated short featuring your musical trio ‘Ravex’ alongside Astro Boy, a prominent character that was animated by the legendary Osamu Tezuka. What was your involvement in this animated project? Even though Osamu Tezuka passed away decades ago, I still had the unique opportunity to meet his son. It was through us meeting that I got to learn many inspiring things about his father, and it was honestly such an incredible experience. We didn’t actually make music for the anime, rather, it was an animated project created for our music. We basically requested to have Tezuka’s all-star cast take part. As early as high-school it has been noted that you have been studying the English language. Has this in anyway benefited you as a musician? Would you consider this an important asset in your role as a creative, especially with the current importance of the internet? As I’m an artist, I don’t believe that being able to speak English is an “asset” to my creation, rather, I’d like to believe my asset is creativity that surpasses the need to speak multiple languages. Or at least, that’s what I’d like to believe. In many instances being able to speak the language has played a major role in me meeting a lot of different people, as well as connecting with others through the internet. It’s through those digital connections and friendships that I’ve grown to understand the views of foreigners consuming and enjoying Japan’s music and animation. I think we can both agree that events like Neon District are a prime example of this, but do you think that the internet-age has broken down the barriers between international audiences and Japanese music? Do you see this trend continuing to develop in the coming years? While the internet plays such an important role in breaking down these barriers, I still feel as though it isn’t enough. I firmly believe that it is more about people’s love and understanding than anything else. The internet is a powerful tool, but I still feel as though it’s more about the energy of human emotion. Everyone attending Neon District is going to give off a wide-variety of emotions throughout the night. Everyone there will be making history, and that’s what breaking barriers is all about. I feel it’s such a gift for me to have the opportunity to meet and discuss with like-minded individuals from other countries about the music I love. It’s now up to us to keep the fire burning. Finally, Is there anything you want to say to your fans in the US ahead of your performance at Anime Expo’s Neon District? It’s an enormous honor for me to be one of the headlining performers at Neon District. You can expect me to play an eclectic lineup of music including House, Drum ‘n’ Bass, Hardcore, Trap and so much more. It’s going to be a diverse mash of both new and old, and of course, you can expect a few m-flo tunes in-between. I look forward to seeing you, and can’t wait to make history together.

11278|2017-06-23|13:45|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/gainax-lawsuit/| News | N/A | Gainax to Pay Studio Khara 100 Million Yen in Royalties | It's bee announced that Gainax have been ordered to pay royalty fees to Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno's Studio Khara to the tune of 100 million yen. |In a long-drawn out legal battle that could possibly have quite a profound effect on the anime industry as a whole, anime studio Gainax have been ordered by the Tachikawa Tokyo District Court to pay royalty fees to Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno's Studio Khara, to the tune of 100 million yen. The lawsuit which began back in early 2016 saw former Gainax-founder Hideaki Anno claim that his previous studio owed upwards of 100 million yen (roughly $900,000 USD) in unpaid royalties. It's uncertain over what period of time this must be paid to Studio Khara, as well as where the studio currently stands in relation to Gainax. Hideaki Anno plays an important central role in this litigation. Since leaving Gainax to form Studio Khara, Anno had understandably left the rights of some of his biggest hits in the hands of the studio he founded with many of his university friends. Upon leaving, both the studio and Anno formed an agreement wherein any royalties that were earned from Anno's properties were to be paid to Studio Khara. However, as of July of 2014, these royalties had not yet been paid, leading to the uncomfortable situation which inevitably lead to this lawsuit. There were no comments from either party, and it's been reported that Gainax did not appeal the court ruling. It's yet to be seen what long-standing effect this will have on Gainax as a company, though we imagine only time can tell in this situation. It's worth noting that interestingly enough, Gainax had co-operated in the creation of Studio Khara's Rebuild of Evangelion films, so it's intriguing that such a rift was allowed to exist. Still, business is business I suppose. It remains to be seen what kind of broader effect this will ripple throughout the industry. Source: Yahoo!

The prominent coin zipper grab is likely our favorite touch.If you thought that you might be able to give your wallet a little break after that fantastic fashion collaboration between Nintendo and Uniqlo that recently took place, you may want to think again. Just announced today, this latest crossover between one of the world’s most beloved video game companies, alongside one of its most recognizable characters, will be taking place with long-running North American luggage company LeSportsac. The collaboration contains some seriously eye-catching flare to it, and I’ve totally fallen head over heals for it as an enthusiast of all things “gaming fashion”. I mean, just take a look at this collection, it’s absolutely incredible: Featuring the exclusive “Power-up Burst” design, the backpack is the series’ main entry. Carry the “Power-up Burst” design at your side with this cool-looking tote bag. The prominent coin zipper grab is likely our favorite touch. This cross-body bag mixes it up with another exclusive design. Are you ready for an odyssey? This bag is adorned with internationally-inspired Mario luggage tags, passport stamps and postcards. If you’re going for a more traditional look, this purse is sure to fit the ticket. Some of the Mario series most dynamic power-ups are displayed front and center on this cosmetics bag. Your look is sure to fire whenever you pop this one out! Though not featuring one of the collaboration-exclusive designs, this Game Boy pouch may well just be that essential piece of gear you need to display your fandom to the utmost. The prominence given to the power ups on the backpack and the tote bag prove to be definitive eye-catchers in my own personal taste. It’s hard to recommend too many fashion brands that effectively combine the passion with the looks, so I’m happy to see such attention given towards making this a visage that works. Coming straight from the official announcement, you can see why the two companies are eager to provide such a loud, yet still-wearable look: The collaboration features two unique designs created exclusively for the LeSportsac X Nintendo collection. Power-Up Burst is a colorful homage to Mario’s iconic power-up items and classic foes, including Fire Flowers, Super Mushrooms, 1-Up Mushrooms, Super Stars, coins, Goombas and Koopas.

Well, if you’re anything like me, you’re probably planning on spending a good portion of it indoors. I mean, that backlog of anime and video games isn’t going to catch up on itself, right? Perhaps somewhere on the backlog of series sits Akira Toriyama’s mega-hit franchise Dragon Ball Super, and that’s where I’ve got good news for you. What if I told you that there’s an insane new event taking place here in Japan, which will have you racing with other fans of one of Japan’s most famous series’ of all time? Behold, Dragon Ball Run, a totally wild-looking “fun run” style event that was just announced by Fuji TV and Toei Animation. If the apt event title didn’t quite give you enough information as for what to expect, just take a peek at the teaser video below: 【発表】世界初のドラゴンボールラン東京・愛知で開催決定！ 9/10(sun)東京エリア@幕張海浜公園 9/23(sat)愛知エリア@りんくうビーチ 詳細 https://t.co/3KI882HuID ドラゴンボールの世界観を体感できるファンランイベントに乞うご期待 pic.twitter.com/1TZzDlaHSj — DRAGONBALL RUN (@dragonball_run) June 20, 2017 If you are at all familiar with the way that more traditional fun runs are handled, the teaser clip above manages to give us a pretty good idea of what to expect. Imagine yourself surrounded by what could be thousands of fellow Dragon Ball fans, donning the esteemed kame garment, all whilst running together in the name of fun. On top of that, just think of the cosplay opportunities! The official announcement for the event gives us a pretty good idea of what to expect, promising the ability to take augmented reality selfies with your favorite characters along the path, as well as exclusive goods and a free t-shirt for all. It’s even mentioned that there will be even appearances from the voice cast themselves. If that all sounds great to you, then make sure you are in Japan either on Sunday, September 10 or Saturday, September 23. Even if you happen to be traveling around, you may not be as far away from one of the events as you may think, as two Japanese cities will host the run. Here are the official details: Tokyo Area: 9/10/2017 (Sunday) Location: Chiba Prefecture Makuhari Seaside Park Nagoya Area: 9/23/2017 (Saturday) Location: Aichi Rinku Beach Ticket Prices: Adult – 6800 yen (~$60.93 USD) Kids – 3800 yen ($34.05 USD) Adult & Kid combo ticket – 9800 yen ($87.80 USD) Tickets will go on sale starting July 3 at 12:00 pm JST. An event like this seems like it could truly be a one-of-a-kind experience, but only if the situation avoids turning into another Planet Namek.

We’ve all seen the pictures – in the past, Japanese airlines have been no strangers to collaborating with popular characters from Hello Kitty to Pokemon. This may be the first time I’ve seen such a focused appeal straight to the hearts of anime and game otaku, though. 鮮やかな機体カラーも素敵なLCC、【Peach】さんとのコラボによる「艦これ」ジェット旅客機【A320】、CAmodeの二航戦「飛龍」「蒼龍」、そしてLCC搭乗modeの「吹雪」が、無事大空に飛び立ちました。提督の皆さん、どうぞよろしくお願い致します！#艦これ#Peach仕様 pic.twitter.com/MwCB8IeWAL — 「艦これ」開発/運営 (@KanColle_STAFF) May 26, 2017 Chances are I might just have to find an excuse to fly from Osaka to Fukuoka, the very route that flight MM157 soars on. Gracing the left side of the plane is Destroyer Fubuki, complete with a Peach shopping bag. Looking at the other side, we can see Aircraft Carriers Souryuu and Hiryuu, who also happen to be sister ships in the original fleet. In what may be my favorite touch, the two are wearing the very same scarves that Peach flight attendants sport inside the planes. Both aircraft and Kancolle fans were eager to snap-photos of the vessel in action, and they offer some great close-up views.

While I suppose cruise ships and ferry boats may have fit the bill a little more snugly, the plane at least features two aircraft carriers to provide suitability. In a country like Japan where the domestic transportation options are plentiful, this is just one of many right moves companies can take to get dedicated customer base flowing their way. We’ve seen it with cafes and we’ve seen it with zoos – otaku money may just be the difference between financial ruin and profitability; or maybe having cute anime girls on your plane is what distinguishes you between being just another airline and the ultimate social media talking point. Now, if you can hook me up with a replica figure of the craft, I’d call this mission a success. Kantai Collection, or KanColle for short, started off as a web browser based strategy game that put you in the position of admiral over a fleet of historical naval vessels, only with one important twist – all those boats are now “kanmusu,” or “ship daughters.” And thus, another gijinka smash-hit was born. The game would go on to inspire loads of fanworks, official manga and anime adaptations, and even a theatrical film. This was the next logical step, really.

The wildly talented idol-duo find themselves carving their own hyper-colorful niche into the industry, utilizing high-paced vibrant imagery in conjunction with their playful and often out-there styles. From the busy streets of Shibuya all the way to the bustling city of Los Angeles, you can expect to see Namakopuri give it their all in both live art and musical performances. The musical duo first came to my attention back in mid-2016 following the release of their oddly-club centric single ‘Sushi Party’ which was produced by trackmaker Masayoshi Iimori. It was by far one of the most hype-inducing, question-raising tracks I had ever heard, and I loved every bit of it. The duo are currently signed to OIRAN MUSIC, a Shibuya-based label that focuses on a variety of different club music genres. Storming onto the scene in mid-2014 with their scary-cute single namakopuri’s trap, the duo continue to churn out hyper-energetic tunes and gorgeous art. It won’t take long after checking out the attached video to see just what we mean when we say scary-cute. But you know what? That’s all part of the illustrious Namakopuri charm we’ve come to know and love. Outside of the realm of music, you’ll often find the girls in either cosplay or a painters gown, and sometimes even both. We’re extremely excited to have them join us at our booth during Anime Expo 2017, and we’re sure you’ll love the quirkiness they bring to the human world. For those of you that had the chance to visit our booth during Anime Central, you’ll definitely remember the charm that unit member Makopuri brought to the booth. If you’re interested in checking out more of Namakopuri’s works, it’s definitely worth heading over to their SoundCloud and Twitter.

It’s this wondrous land of opportunity for those who strive for it, and there’s nobody who envisions this belief more so than Tokyo-based producer Ujico*Snail’s House. Flipping a musical production hobby into a full-time practice is never easy, but by breaking down various barriers that stood in his way, the now 20-year old Ujico managed to secure his position as one of Japan’s fastest rising producers. When I first met Ujico face-to-face, the still young bedroom producer saw himself sitting atop a 20,000 strong following. He was an individual filled with compassion, finding music as an ideal escape and method of self-expression. Throughout the span of a year, he’s managed to earn almost 75,000 SoundCloud followers, as well as having a backlog of multi-million viewed songs on YouTube. This is where his ‘Ordinary Songs’ series comes into play, what was in essence originally a file-dump went on to grow into one of the artists most successful releases. Ordinary Songs 3 builds off the enormous momentum started by the original two releases, and then introduces us to so much more. It’s an illustrious five-track example of just what Ujico is capable of, flawlessly painting on the canvas of your imagination. I’m profoundly in love with each and every track on the release, with each song tugging at the strings of their own unique emotion. Songs like ‘Lullaby’ paint a picture-perfect landscape of a setting sun, as the realm of nighttime infectiously begins to take over the latter half of ones day. On the flip side, songs like ‘Aloha’ sound very much like they could be the soundtrack to ones adventures through the city. With Ujico’s scheduled performance in Los Angeles early next month at conXion during Anime Expo, you can definitely expect to hear a few of these tracks ringing through the hallways. We’re super excited to see him there, with all of his performances captivating the same ecstatic energy that he fills his songs with. If you’re in the area, we definitely urge you to check him out, as talent like his doesn’t come along too often. If you’re interested in supporting Ujico’s latest release, it’s available at a ‘name your price’ exchange on Bandcamp, here. He’s also on both Twitter and Soundcloud, where he keeps fans up-to-date on upcoming releases and happenings. We’ve also conducted an interview with the rising-artist in the past, which is available here.|Anime Expo, conXion, Ordinary Songs 3, Snail's House, Ujico

I’ve mentioned in the past that I’m a massive fan of the quirky collaborations Sanrio operates, and this is absolutely no exception. In their own respects, both characters are extremely relevant icons, and it makes sense that we’d see the two join forces, even if just for a short line of merchandise. It’s the first time that Sanrio has ever found itself working with a Western-made comic book series, and I’m sure we can all agree that there’s no better place to start. With the recent international success of Wonder Woman, the heroine has been finding herself all over the place as of late. For those who pre-purchase tickets for the late-August film screenings here in Japan, they’ll receive both a rubber key-holder featuring the collaborative Hello Kitty, as well as a reprint of the original comic in which Wonder Woman was originally introduced. Advance tickets will go on sale June 17, so for those interested you’ll want to get in fast. If you’re interested in checking our further information, you’ll be able to find it on the official website for the upcoming film, here. |Collaboration, HELLO KITTY, Sanrio, Wonder Woman
11218|2017-06-15|00:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/anime-expo-2017-must/| News | N/A | Here’s What We’re Most Excited For at Anime Expo 2017 | We’re just over two weeks out from Anime Expo 2017, and we couldn’t be more excited. We’ve been kept on edge for months now leading up to the grand event, being fed only snippets of information regarding guests and panels. This all … |We’re just over two weeks out from Anime Expo 2017, and we couldn’t be more excited. We’ve been kept on edge for months now leading up to the grand event, being fed only snippets of information regarding guests and panels. This all changed recently however, as the floodgates were finally opened to the general public — and boy is there a whole lot to go through. Chances are, if you’re anything like me, you’ll be attending the convention for the entire four-day duration. So if that’s the case, you’re probably furiously trying to figure out what is worth checking out, especially during short period of time. Lucky for you, it’s kinda my job to do that. Conventions are hard, and planning your schedule around personal and friend interests is even harder. So today we’re going to break down the things that we’re most excited for at Anime Expo in the hopes it’ll alleviate a little bit of the convention related stress. So without further ado, let’s take a look at what we’re most excited for at this years convention (in no particular order): 1. FLCL 2 & 3 Panel (July 2, 3:00pm – 4:00pm) Does this really need any explanation? In March of 2016 it was announced via Toonami’s official Facebook page that we’d be seeing a second and third season of FLCL co-produced by them an Production I.G. respectively. It’s been mostly silence since then, with little word other than an official synopsis and a late 2017/early 2018 release timeframe. If you’re a fan of the FLCL series, this is most definitely not something you’re going to want to miss. We’ve included the official synopsis below, just incase you needed a kicker to get excited again: In the new season of FLCL, many years have passed since Naota and Haruhara Haruko shared their adventure together. Meanwhile, the war between the two entities known as Medical Mechanica and Fraternity rages across the galaxy. Enter Hidomi, a young teenaged girl who believes there is nothing amazing to expect from her average life, until one day when a new teacher named Haruko arrives at her school. Soon enough, Medical Mechanica is attacking her town and Hidomi discovers a secret within her that could save everyone, a secret that only Haruko can unlock. But why did Haruko return to Earth? What happened to her Rickenbacker 4001 she left with Naota? And where did the human-type robot ‘Canti’ go? The official panel description also states that we’ll get our first look at some form of trailer, giveaways, as well as production announcements. If you’re interested in checking it out, the panel will be taking place in ‘Live Programming 2’ at the JW Marriott. Further information can be found on the official website, here. 2. studio TRIGGER panel (July 2, 4:30pm – 6:00pm) Following the recent announcement made by the Studio TRIGGER regarding ‘Inferno Cop 2‘ at AnimeNEXT, we’ve got extremely high hopes for the teams Anime Expo panel. The Los-Angeles-based convention has always been a major hub for the studio, with films such as ‘Little Witch Academia 2’ making their world debut at Anime Expo. The panel is slated to be operating for an hour and a half, meaning that there’s bound to be a whole lot of exclusive content crammed in. It’s definitely not something you’ll want to miss. If you’re not familiar with Studio TRIGGER, they’re the creative geniuses behind beloved series’ such as ‘Kill la Kill’, ‘Little Witch Academia’, ‘Kiznaiver’, Inferno Cop, and a plethora of other entries. The team is mostly comprised of former GAINAX employees, with each of them bringing their own level of creativity to the table. If you’re attending the aforementioned FLCL panel, getting to this one won’t be a problem. It takes place just 30-minutes later, inside the same hall, ‘Live Programming 2’. Further information can be found on the official website, here. 3. ‘Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card Prologue’ World Premiere (July 1, 4:00pm – 5:00pm) Unless you’ve been sleeping under a rock for the past few months, you should know how excited we all are for the world premiere of ‘Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card Prologue’— and you should be too. It’s the continuation of one of the anime industries most iconic magical girl series, and the team at Kodansha Comics are teaming up with Anime Expo to make sure we all get to see it first. On top of the opportunity to be the first people in the world to see the prologue OVA, you’ll also get the unique opportunity to partake in a Q&A session with the anime producer. There will also be exclusive giveaways done at the event; it’s truly not something that you’ll want to miss. If you’re interested in checking this out, you’ll want to head over to ‘LACC Main Events Hall B’ early. Further information can be found on the official website, here. 4. conXion presented by Attack the Music (July 1, 8:00pm – 1:00am) These next two are for my fellow late-night party fans, and boy are they something to get excited about. If you’ve ever actually enjoyed yourself at an anime convention rave, chances are the team at Attack the Music were behind it. They’re a multi-talented group of individuals who have helped pioneer meaningful relations between the Japanese music scene and conventions all across North America. During Anime Expo 2017, they’ll be operating their first ever North American label showcase, featuring some of their best international and domestic talent for a non-stop night of fun. You can expect to see artists such as Ujico*/Snail’s House, K03, Voia, Mitomoro, and so many more taking to the stage for what’s bound to be an unmissable event. From 8:00pm until 10:00pm anyone with a badge over the age of 16 will be able to enter, and then from 10:00pm onwards it’ll be switching to an 18+ event. It’ll be taking place at ‘AXDance 150+151’ in the Los Angeles Convention Center, and chances are you’ll want to be there early. Further information can be found on the official website, here. 5. Neon District (July 3, 8:00pm – 2:00am) I know it’s kinda cheesy to pull a “I saved the best for last” in 2017, but well, I simply couldn’t help it. There’s so much to be excited about leading up to Anime Expo’s flagship ‘Neon District’ event that I have to take a moment to collect my thoughts. Let me paint a picture for you really quick; you’re nearing the end of the convention, and things have been busy — really busy. You’re looking for a way to unwind, when suddenly you hear the thumping sounds of some of the best-known Japanese club sounds in the distance. You head over to ‘Main Events Hall B’, and there’s an entire room full of people who are finding themselves lost in the eclectic sounds that have defined Tokyo’s underground music scene for years. This is Neon District, or at least what it’s painting itself to be. I could wax poetry for hours about how excited I am for this lineup, but I’ll let you do that yourself. Headlining the event are a wide-roster of talented individuals, including Taku Takahashi, Ram Rider, Teddyloid, Pa’s Lam System, and so many others. It’s going to undoubtedly be a massive night for everyone involved, and we can’t wait to experience it ourselves. Further information can be found on the official website, here. What are you looking forward to at Anime Expo 2017? There’s so much more set to be going on, but these are definitely our essential five.

Announcements are being made left and right with little room to even stop and breathe, and we’re totally loving it. One of the things we’re possibly most excited about however is the announcement that major Shibuya/Harajuku brands Galaxxxy, Listen Flavor and Baby Doll Tokyo will all be making their way to the convention for the annual fashion show. These brands are undeniably pioneers of the Harajuku fashion scene, and have all played an essential role in shaping global perceptions of Tokyo’s fashion-driven backstreets. From Galaxxxy’s neo-80’s driven aesthetics to Listen Flavors pastel flare, then all the way to Baby Doll Tokyo’s vintage charm, these are brands you’ve most definitely seen snapped a million times within the realm of Takeshita Street. What makes this years fashion show so important is a legitimate representation of Harajuku outside of Japan, allowing for a more realistic understanding of what’s actually going on here. This years fashion show will be taking place on July 2 from 4:00pm – 6:30pm at LACC\Live Programming (Petree Hall). You’ll need an Anime Expo badge valid on that day to get in, but it’s guaranteed to be a seriously enjoyable evening based on those names. Personally, I probably have at least 10 or more Galaxxxy pieces in my closet, and the team have absolutely been killing it this year with their latest looks and pieces. If their performance, as well as everyone else’s performance is anything to go by, we’ve got a lot to look forward to this year.

Released Tuesday, the unit made true to their recent crowdfunding campaign that saw them raise almost 5 million yen over a 30-day period from some 492 diehard fans and dropped ‘Kakushe-mu’. Released through the ICIGOSTYLE Official YouTube channel, the Yunomi-produced Ichigo Rinahamu-written track has already amassed almost 10,000 plays. Never failing to outshine themselves, their latest music video for ‘Kakushe-mu’ is a quirky blend of the groups high-paced visual and musical brilliance. Following hot on the heel of their debut music video ‘te to te’, we see yet another prime example of just what the current neo-idol scene is capable of. The music video, which runs for about three and a half minutes total positions the group riding clouds through the skies and enjoying a shared meal. And everything else that happens too, I guess. The song is an absolute treat, and it’s definitely going to be on repeat over here for a lifetime. Blending the hard-hitting sounds of Japan’s diverse club scene with a unique take on the rapidly-aging idol industry, CY8ER and their associated groups are a breath of fresh air amongst the bunch. With a massive set of shows about to take place, there’s a whole lot going on in the world of CY8ER, and I’m super excited to be able to watch it all unfold. If you’re interested in checking out some of our previous write-ups about the unit, you’ll find the full archive here.

Much like everywhere else on Earth, stock has been less than favorable here in Japan, with resellers basically ruling the market with their jacked up prices. I can’t tell whether I’m trying to pick up a limited-edition pair of sneakers or a Nintendo console at this point, it’s kind of insane. This week has been difficult, and I feel like last night was the final nail in the coffin following Nintendo’s E3 conference. If you didn’t happen to see it, Nintendo went all in last night on their ever-apparent first-party titles for the Switch and 3DS respectively. Showcasing everything they’ve got lined up for the Switch’s first year, we got to see titles such as Kirby, Yoshi, and even a sneak peak at Metroid Prime 4. But more important than all else, we got another look at the world of Super Mario Odyssey and it’s expansive universe. Set to release October 27, you can check out the full trailer below: Of all the rose-tinted games of my childhood, none defined my interests more than Super Mario Sunshine. Like many others, I’ve been desperately clawing at the idea of enjoying it on my (eventual) Switch since rumors about the handheld console hybrid first started circulating. Perhaps that desperation can finally be put aside, even if just for a little bit, with the hype that the latest Super Mario Odyssey trailer has built up for me. Through the E3-releaese ‘Game Trailer’, as well as the slew of gameplay footage released, things are looking really, really good for the upcoming title. Best of all, we won’t have to wait long to enjoy it given the release date being a short four months away. Across it’s action packed two and a half minute runtime, we’re treated to the visual fiesta that is Odyssey. Spanning multiple worlds, we see Mario take the form of Koopa’s, Bullet Bill’s, and even a T-Rex all in his quest to protect Princess Peach from being forcefully wedded away to Bowser. The game is a colorful throwback to some of my absolute favorite tropes from the previous 3D entries into the series, and I can’t wait to see where the full game takes us. One thing I do know however is getting my Switch sure isn’t going to be easy, especially if Nintendo keeps this onslaught of games up.

Breaking away from the ice cold world of Kachi Kochi, Doraemon’s latest adventure finds itself inspired by ‘Treasure Island’, the 1883 novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. It’s set to be a seriously enjoyable high-sea adventure, and we can’t wait to see how it pans out, regardless of the almost year long wait ahead of us. It’s set to have a seriously star-studded lineup of industry veterans working on it, including novelist Genki Kawamura who produced both ‘The Boy and the Beast’, as well as the record-breaking ‘your name.’ penning the script. On top of this, directing the film will be one of the original episode directors from the 2005 anime series, Kazuaki Imai. This will be his debut directorial work within the Doraemon film universe. While not much else has been detailed outside of a sampling of the involved staff, as well as the above visual, there’s a lot to be excited for building off the success of the previous film. More recently, we’ve seen a lot of really creative collaborations take place within the Doraemon universe. One of my favorites in recent memory is most definitely the franchise collaboration with established sneaker brand Puma for a sweet limited-edition line of shoes.

11287|2017-06-13|16:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/monster-hunter-world/| News | N/A | "Monster Hunter" Goes Multi-Platform in Upcoming Releas | "Monster Hunter" Goes Multi-Platform in It's Upcoming Release |Believe it or not, there was once a time when Japanese gaming monolith Monster Hunter wasn't a Nintendo exclusive series. It's been an enduring six years since then, with almost every kid in Japan needing to pick up their own 3DS just to play. Today however, things are about to change, at least if the announcement from Sony's E3 conference mean anything. Officially announced today, we got our first look at the upcoming Monster Hunter World which will be coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC early 2018. If you're not familiar with the Monster Hunter franchise, I couldn't blame you. It's a series that's undeservingly largely been overlooked by international audiences since it's early days. That isn't so much the case here in Japan however, with the series often being a deciding factor for many as to which console they would go on to buy. The latest entry into the series, Monster Hunter XX, managed to push over 1.3 million units within Japan alone in it's opening month. Those are some serious numbers, especially for a Japan-only 3DS title. I might be getting ahead of myself a little in saying this, but the game is looking absolutely incredible.Defying the conventions of it's predecessors, Monster Hunter World appears to show a heavy focus on exploration and free-movement within it's vast and open world. It has been detailed by Capcom that the game will also feature drop-in multiplayer functionality, allowing players from all around the world to embark in four-player co-op questing. Bridging the gap between Japan and the West appears to be a key-point for Capcom, and Monster Hunter World aims to work towards it. The full release from Capcom can be seen below, in which they delve further into the specific details of the game: Monster Hunter: World introduces a living, breathing ecosystem in which players take on the role of a hunter that seeks and slays ferocious beasts in heart-pounding battles that unfold across the vast ever-changing terrain. ... Retaining the series’ skill based progression and robust crafting system, players gear up to venture on quests to seek and slay monsters, progressively improving their skills to become the ultimate hunter. Loot collected from fallen foes can be used to create new equipment and armor upgrades styled after the monsters they’ve slain, allowing hunters to survive the elements and defeat the tougher opponents that await them. Monster Hunter: World delivers a seamless gameplay experience allowing players to move freely across map areas that comprise the living ecosystems and dynamically transition from day to night. The landscape and its diverse inhabitants play a critical role in each quest as players strategically use the surrounding environment including terrain, vegetation and wildlife to their advantage in battle or become hindered by the hazards they present. Hunters must use their cunning and abilities to track and maneuver their targets throughout the intense, evolving battles. With flexible online multiplayer options and an accessible quest structure, players can tackle challenges alone or join up to three other hunters online for cooperative play. For the first time in the Monster Hunter™ series, players from Japan and the west can play together online, providing an expanded base of cooperative hunting companions. With the new online drop-in functionality, solo players can hail for assistance from the worldwide group during quests when their opponents are too daunting to take on single-handedly.

In a somewhat shocking announcement from Studio Trigger that took place at AnimeNEXT in New Jersey, it was announced that Inferno Cop would be receiving a second series. What is possibly one of the greatest animated shorts, which happens to be by one of my favorite anime studios, will be making it's triumphant return in the name of justice. Inferno Cop 2 will likely follow that same degree of insanity that the first series defined itself by, making for one wild adventure through hell and back. While not much is currently known as of right now, it has been reported that Yoh Yoshinari (FLCL, Gurren Lagann, Neon Genesis Evangelion) will be directing the second series' first episode.

Almost five years since the label initially joined the dojin market following the release of 'S2TB Files 2: Activate', we're finally seeing the end of an era. Across it's tremendous lifespan, S2TB Recording became home to over 17 releases, using the Japanese hardcore sound as it's backbone, whilst taking a chance across all genres. If you're not quite familiar with Kors K, or his work with S2TB Recording, the label was initially conceived as a creative outlet for expression outside of his regular musical career. With the bi-annual Comiket set as it's home, the label would go on to defy all odds selling out almost every release. As an independent label, it was a force to be reckoned with, even in spite of it's young age. Calling on a diverse international roster of talent, we saw artists such as Akira Complex build an entire career through these independent releases, but at times this would prove difficult for everyone. It's almost five years since my first Comic Market release ''S2TB Files2: Activate''. I think the dojin scene is a wonderful place where anyone can express their creativity. It's a place where producers can set their work aside and enjoy music purely as a hobby; at least that's what it's really supposed to be. In recent years, it hasn't been easy for me to find the time between projects to prepare for the summer and winter Comic Market releases. I've been having to push myself hard, both physically and mentally, to be able to put out my recent Dojin releases. The number of releases has been increasing tremendously, and I feel it has become overwhelming for both the producers and consumers. The value of music has been depreciating, and I have started feeling that I unwittingly took part in accelerating the depreciation. Kors K is of course talking about the obscene difficulty of pushing out so much content between each Comiket, with each event seeing the release of a handful of albums and compilations. What was once viewed as no more than a creative hobby had rapidly grown larger than anyone could have imagined. In Kors K' eyes, this growth would go on to create an unmaintainable demand, and thus a decline in each releases quality. It was because of this that it was deemed necessary to enter this indefinite hiatus, solidifying the positive memories of the label within everyones mind. Outside of their extraordinary musical releases, S2TB Recording was perhaps best known for their major events thrown each year. Both 'S2TB Gathering' and 'S2TBTANO*C' would prove to be arena-packing shows, with each of the labels artists giving it their all. Every year the shows grew bigger and bigger, switching from the clubs of Shibuya to major live venues across Japan. One last time we'll have the opportunity to witness these events, and one last time we'll give it our all. Going out with a bang, it was announced that 'S2TBTANO*C' will set the stage for the labels grand finale. Taking place September 18, fans will be given a final chance to give their thanks to one of Japan's greatest independent labels. The event will be operating a crowdfunding campaign in the near future, with planning currently underway. Kors K adds that this isn't the end of his individual music career, and that we can expect a whole lot to come from him, even if it's separate from the label that he once called home. Thank you, S2TB Recording and best of luck, Kors K. |Hardcore, Hiatus, kors k, S2TB, TANO*C

It’s because of this that playlist.004// will be paying tribute not just to the names we knew and loved, but also to the emotions such news bring forward. This week we look to turn the heat up on otherwise temperate nights, keeping the spirit alive through uplifting sounds. Pulling a large amount of inspiration from the ‘club sounds’ that have defined my past week, we see a mostly new lineup of names, with some returning artists sprinkled within. From Ujico*/Snail’s House’ sugar-coated ‘Bouquet’, all the way to the hyperactive hardcore remix of m-flo’s own ‘Tripod Baby’, this week is going to have you jumping all day long. Towards the end of the playlist I’ve also opted to include a 2013 release, which even though it is slightly dated compared to the rest of the included tracks, happens to be one of the most important S2TB releases to me personally.

He's the creative mind behind some of the worlds best looking sneakers; as well as the visual designer behind some of our all-time favorite art-pieces. When it comes to Tokyo-based designers, I'd even argue that not many come close to his prowess, but that's just my opinion. From his work with musicians such as Tofubeats, all the way to big name brands such as Puma, GraphersRock' work defines the very subcultures that define us. Pairing up with fellow Tokyo-based creative and designer 'Nukeme', the duo have managed to reinvent some of the worlds most iconic street fashion brands. In their joint exhibit which begins today at the Shinjuku GANKA Gallery, the pair have glitched and stitched brands Supreme and COMME des GARÇONS, entirely in the name of art. After growing tired of the recent culture surrounding Supreme, GraphersRock reached out to Nukeme to slightly alter his collection of bogo hats in an effort to differentiate, whilst still paying tribute to the brand he loves. Nukeme is a specialist in glitch arts, and you can definitely see this in the slightly off-tempo styles that he defines this latest exhibit with. It's beauty in the little details, and we're with it the whole way. If you're interested in checking out the full collection, as well as the exhibit, you'll find it at the below location with the times attached: Dear Supreme, Dear PLAY Nukeme & GraphersRock 〒160-0022 東京都新宿区新宿5-18-11 June 9 - June 14, 2017 12:00pm - 8:00pm https://www.gankagarou.com/ It's super exciting to see where this exhibit lands the two Tokyo-based creatives, especially as we begin to see them appearing in more and more places.

While the former may have it’s negative side-effects (hair loss, for one), the latter has proven to be nothing but positive. From One-Punch Man to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and even series like Naruto: Shippuuden and Gurren Lagann, Shingo Natsume has played an important role in them all. So when the opportunity arose to personally sit down with Natsume himself, it wasn’t something we were going to turn down. In part one of our video interview series, Natsume Shingo discusses his role in the industry, and just what helped shape him as a person. Originally entering the industry as an illustrator and animator, Shingo Natsume had a dream of crafting traditional anime into film. With humble beginnings, it was Natsume’s goal to eventually direct his own project. Starting in the field of production, it wasn’t long before he had worked his way up into his first directorial role, the 2012 OVA Horimiya. From there, Natsume would go on to work as director for series such as Space Dandy, One-Punch Man and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. From a young age Natsume knew that an ordinary office job wasn’t fit for him, claiming that he always wanted to create something. Pulling influence from a wide-range of sources including Studio Ghibli’s classic animated film Princess Mononoke, as well as the 1996 cult classic Neon Genesis Evangelion, he set to work in the industry trying to find his calling. If you’re interested in checking it out, Shingo Natsume’s latest directorial work, ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. can be streamed on Crunchyroll, here. |Director, Fullmetal Alchemist, Gurren Lagann, interview, Naruto, One Punch Man, Shingo Natsume, Video
11438|2017-06-08|14:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/usj-super-nintendo-world/| News | Games | Universal Studios Japan "Super Nintendo World" Teaser Video | 'Super Nintendo World' is set to join the already expansive theme park just in time for the 2020 Olympics taking place here in Tokyo. |In what could quite possibly be one of the greatest moves of all time, Universal Studios Japan has today revealed further details on their long-planned collaboration with Nintendo. 'Super Nintendo World' is set to join the already expansive theme park just in time for the 2020 olympics taking place here in Tokyo. The area will feature two areas based on Nintendo's most successful series, including an all-immersive 'Mario Kart' section. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to switch from the console experience to the real-deal. It all began following an announcement made in 2015 by both Nintendo and Universal Studios Japan, stating that they were in the planning stages of a 300 million dollar collaborative project. It didn't take long for it to be announced that North America would also be getting it's own themed-world. Today however, after much personal anticipation, we were finally given some (animated) footage as to what we can expect from the project. Running for a total of 32 seconds, the video can be streamed below: For those of you that are anything like me, you're probably more than excited to finally head over to Osaka and experience the wonders of Mario's world brought to life. While there's still a three year launch window, just consider this; if you think the wait for the park to launch is bad, imagine the wait in line for each attraction. It's going to be busy, but it's going to be a lot of fun, and that'll especially hold up if the teaser trailer is anything to go by. The official website for 'Super Nintendo World' states that it will be split up into two main areas, one dedicated to the world of 'Mario Kart', and another themed area dedicated to shopping, restaurants, and other related attractions. We'll be sure to keep you updated as more information is revealed to the world. Are you excited for 'Super Nintendo World'? We're personally ecstatic towards the whole idea of it, and can't wait to check it out.

11437|2017-06-08|07:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/swimmer-closing/| News | N/A | Harajuku Set to Lose One of Its Most Iconic Brands "SWIMMER" | Today we received word that we'd be losing one of Harajuku's greatest small brands, SWIMMER. |In a tragic post that went live on Twitter today, we discovered that staple Harajuku brand SWIMMER will be closing down all of it's locations, as well as it's sister brand chocoholic, after 30 years of operation. If you have ever had the opportunity to visit any of SWIMMER's locations, you'd understand what I mean when I say that they were an absolute essential for any budding fashionista or kawaii enthusiast. Operated by a bubbly team of staff, they offered low-priced accessories and goods for just about any look years on end. In a letter sent out to all their shoppers and fans, they expressed deep regret in their closure and eternal gratitude for the support they had received. They also explained that manufacturing had simply gotten too expensive for the independent stores, and they simply weren't able to continue to operate under such conditions. From January 2018 all locations will be closed down, and it will be in December 2017 that the online store will cease to exist. For those of you that haven't seen the tweet sent out, I've gone ahead and embedded it below: 【ブランド終了のお知らせ】 この度2018年1月末をもちまして SWIMMER、chocoholic を終了する運びとなりました。 これまで長きにわたりご愛顧頂きましたこと、深く感謝申し上げます。https://t.co/qxeI5jlr6h pic.twitter.com/YbRTdhGVno — SWIMMER Press (@SWIMMER_Press) 8 June 2017 I've been seeing a lot of reports on the death of Harajuku culture throughout the last year, and whilst I've been keeping my distance from contributing to that trend, this latest blow certainly doesn't help at all. It'll be interesting to see where the gentrification and growth of Harajuku leads the fashion capital, especially leading into the 2020 olympics that are just around the corner. With little else to contribute than my unwavering thanks to the entire team at SWIMMER for their commitment over the years, I'd like to remind everyone to support the smaller brands that shape the subcultures we all know and love. There's so many situations where this can be difficult, especially when it comes to price, but your choices are what keeps these cultures alive, especially leading into such uncharted waters. If you're interested in supporting SWIMMER throughout these difficult next two years, you can support them through their online store or at one of their many locations across Japan. Thank you, Swimmer. |Accessories, fashion, harajuku, Independent, Lolita, SWIMMER, chocoholic

From the big reveal yesterday that we'd be able to check out the world premiere of the Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card Arc prologue, all the way to the already exhilarating announcements of events such as Neon District, you'd think things couldn't get much better, right? Well how about we throw in news that Attack the Music will be throwing their debut US label showcase in Los Angeles at Anime Expo, and they'll be bringing over label talent such as Ujico*/Snail's House, KO3, kiraku, while also utilizing their incredible roster of domestic talent. How's that sound? In news that was broken by the team at Attack the Music earlier today, the independent label will be hosting their first ever 'conXion' showcase. Thrown in collaboration with Anime Expo, the showcase aims to demonstrate the labels diverse roster of talent stemming from both Japan and North America. It'll be going down on July 1st at 8pm in the the LACC Concourse Hall F, and will require attendees to already be holding an Anime Expo badge valid on that day, but as long as you have that you're all good to attend. Headlining the electric lineup is the multi-talented Ujico*/Snail's House, who has been a longtime member of the Attack the Music label. If you're not familiar with his work, definitely check out our discussions.001// interview where we sat down and spoke all things Ujico. Also storming the stage will be voia, who recently made waves following the release of his debut album, as well as collaborative works with m-flo's own Taku Takahashi and anime megastar Teddyloid. Coming all the way from Japan will be the hardcore-prodigy KO3, as well as Japan-based synthhead kiraku. Finishing off the lineup are the insanely talented North American backbones of the label, bansheebeat, Hikeii, James Landino, and Mitomoro. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that this show is going to destroy the dance floor, and I can't wait to check it out.

Tasked with blending the culture of Tokyo's high-paced street life and the sports technology involved in PUMA's 'Ignite Disc' series, four designers were given the opportunity to express their creative prowess. Channeling creatives GraphersRock, Mikitype, George Ichikawa, and Hiroki Tsukuda, we're offered what could possibly be some of the best looking sneakers to drop this year. Set to release June 17 here in Japan, the 'Turn on Tokyo' series of sneakers are by far some of the best designed sneakers I've seen in a long time, with the GraphersRock collaboration in particular catching my attention. They represent so many different aspects of Tokyo's thriving street and underground cultures, whilst presenting themselves as entirely functional sneakers at the same time. Using the 'Ignite Disc' signature wire-tightening system, it allows for the sleek design to maintain focus without worrying about laces or straps. While not much news has been released, it has been detailed that we can expect to get our hands on these later this month starting June 17. It's absolutely worth stressing that these likely wont last long, so it's especially important to stay tuned for further information. Each and every design totally stands on their own, and it'll be interesting to see these in person in the coming weeks.

11441|2017-06-06|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/new-pokemon-switch/| News | Games | There Are 3 New "Pokémon" Titles Coming Later This Year | Nintendo has been absolutely killing it lately - their new Switch console-handheld hybrid powerhouse has been flying off the shelves. |Nintendo has been absolutely killing it lately - their new Switch console-handheld hybrid powerhouse has been flying off the shelves. Games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and even recently new IP Arms have been highly-praised experiences, while the hype for the likes of Splatoon 2 and Monster Hunter XX will undoubtedly prolong the drastic hardware shortage all over the world. "How then, can we propel the demand into the stratosphere?" a Nintendo market researcher likely asked themselves. "Pokémon!" the people yelled, largely unprompted. After all, the Switch is practically a super-powered handheld that just so happens to convert to a TV console, right? Finally moving mainline Pokémon over to the TV has long been clamored for, and what better time then now? And hey, there have been plenty of leaks and even job postings over at Game Freak which honestly seemed to indicate as much. More Pokémon can never be a bad thing though, no matter the circumstances, right? Just today at 9 am EST, Nintendo broadcasted one of their popular live video news updates in the form of a Pokémon Direct. Included in the approximately 8-minute long broadcast were announcements for a Nintendo Switch version of 2015's surprise Pokémon 3D fighting game 'Pokken Tournament', 2 new entries in the Pokémon mainline series on the Nintendo 3DS known as 'Ultra Sun' and 'Ultra Moon', and finally Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console releases of both 'Pokémon Gold Version' and 'Pokémon Silver Version'. You can check out the full Direct stream below: Taking up most of the stream spotlight was the Switch re-release of 'Pokkén Tournament DX', with the "DX" standing for "Deluxe". And that would make sense, considering the game is an enhanced version of the original 2015 WiiU release. The game adds new fighters -- all of the characters from the arcade version of the game, plus Decidueye, Popplio and Litten from 'Sun' and 'Moon'. It will also feature a new 3v3 mode and an improved online experience. The game is slated for release on September 22. Next, we got an ultra sneak peek at two ultra divisive games -- 'Pokémon Ultra Sun' and 'Ultra Moon' for the Nintendo 3DS. All that was mentioned after the new footage rolled was that the games will contain an "alternate story" set in the 'Sun' and 'Moon' region of Alola. Oh, and definitely expect some new Pokémon as well. More information is set to be revealed soon. Lastly, on the same day that 'Pokken Tournament DX' goes live for the Switch, Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console versions of 'Pokémon Gold Version' and 'Pokémon Silver Version' will become available for all my fellow nostalgia players out there. I know many who consider it to be the absolute best generation, so this sounds like a definite win to me. As a nice bonus, the titles will also be compatible with the Pokémon Bank app, a cloud storage service for all your Pocket Monsters, which is admittedly a technology I would have never expected to become as prominent as it has. So yes, we did technically get a Nintendo Switch Pokémon game, but it wasn't the shiny high definition version of Sun and Moon that most folks were expecting -- that world is still reserved for the 3DS for the time being. The fans have endearingly even given such a possible title a hypothetical name: Stars. As you may be able to surmise, not everyone is thrilled: People who want Pokemon Stars be like pic.twitter.com/LfRE4tXUen — Akfamilyhome (@akfamilyhomeak) 6 June 2017 Given everything we've seen up to this point however, never give up hope I say. After all, E3 is just around the corner. Be sure to keep an eye on the official Pokémon site here for more information as it becomes available, and we'll keep our fingers crossed that eventually it updates to include some of that Switch goodness.|DX, Nintendo, Nintendo 3DS, Switch, Pokemon, Pokken, Tournament, Ultra Moon, Ultra Sun

News broke today that distributor Kodansha Comics would be bringing the world premiere of the 'Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card Arc Prologue' to Anime Expo in Los Angeles, exclusively on July 1. That's no small deal, especially given the global presence the series maintains. The event will feature anime producer Chiyo Kawazoe for Q&A and giveaway sessions, only available during the premiere event. This is amongst an already massively star-studded lineup for the convention, including the world premiere of the live-action 'Tokyo Ghoul' film that is set to screen in Japan almost a month later. It comes as no surprise that the convention is giving it their all this year, especially with it being the 25th anniversary of Anime Expo. After the conflict with Eriol at the Tokyo Tower, Sakura attained the final Clow Cards: The Dark and The Light. Since then, everything’s gone back to normal––but only briefly. While Eriol has decided to move back to England, Syaoran suddenly confesses his true feeling for Sakura and tells her he is moving back to Hong Kong. What will Sakura do? Although she’s unsure of her own feelings, her best friend Tomoyo tells Sakura that the true answer already lies within her. That is when Sakura decides to make something for her dear friend. While the prologue OVA isn't set to release in Japan until September 2017, you'll be able to get a world-first glimpse exclusively at Anime Expo on July 1.

We're seriously excited for what's to come, and so should you be! |It's official, everyone's favorite dysfunctional sextuplets are coming back beginning October 2017! In an announcement shared today by Avex, we were finally given a timeframe for the continuation to one of our all-time favorite animated series, Osomatsu-san (Mr. Osomatsu). The revelation comes just a couple of short months after we originally detailed that the second season was on it's way. This might just be one of the best years for anime we've had for quite some time, if I dare say so myself. Set to air in Japan via TV Tokyo beginning some time in October, we've got a whole lot to look forward to leading up to the second season screening. Osomatsu-san is most definitely a series that never left the public spotlight, and that was especially true over here in Japan where the franchise has been a staple since it's original conception in 1962 through Fujio Akatsuka's Osomatsu-kun. It's 2015 animated revival spawned a plethora of collaborations and events surpassing anything we've ever seen before. Two years on and the hype still remains at unheard of levels, with the series constantly topping polls and even spawning it's own museum. Alongside the announcement, we were also offered a brand new teaser visual that showcases the sextuplets usual outlandish activities, this time showing them falling from outer-space. Building off the finale of the shows first season, we're seriously excited and can't wait to see what happens throughout the second season. If you're not familiar with the Osomatsu-san series, it's by far one of my personal all-time favorite animated series. It carelessly follows the day by day lives of six twin brothers who through thick and thin, do their absolute best to survive the unemployed lifestyle they lead. Even though they share the same faces, they couldn't be any more different, and that makes their daily adventures all the more exciting. If you're interested in checking out the first season of Osomatsu-san, you can stream it online via Crunchyroll and check out our other related news, here.

The mid-80's anime revolves around a post-apocalyptic, hyper-masculine world where as far as most people can tell, a bunch of buff dads duke it out in the sandpit. In all seriousness though, the anime is a lot of fun, and as such it's PlayStation One game was fittingly just as interesting. When you take that Bruce Lee gone Mad Max style and toss it into the realm of in-game rendered PlayStation One titles, then blend in a plethora of pre-update glitches, you're in for one hell of a ride. This isn't the first time we've seen the late-2000 game freak out, and we can only pray it won't be the last time. During the opening sequence to the game, in which the theme song 'Ai o Torimodose!!' can be heard playing valiantly in the background, Twitter user @JonathanTiddies has shared the beauty that unfolded: PLEASE WATCH THE CORRUPTED OPENING OF THE FIST OF THE NORTH STAR PS1 GAME pic.twitter.com/KQJYec1ErH — Big Wife (@JonathanTiddies) 29 May 2017 The opening scene which would usually play out as heroically as the series, instead finds itself warped into an absolute hot mess. Between the arms flailing and the 360 degree body spinning action, there's a whole lot going on here, and I love every single second of it. I'd even go as far as to debate this being the real opening theme, which I'm sure not many people could argue with. If you haven't treated yourself to watching the original anime series, I strongly suggest this changes sometime soon. Though you may be disappointed by the lack of flying characters, you'll definitely enjoy the adventure along the way. The animated series is available for streaming in full on Crunchyroll, and there's absolutely no better time than the present to check it out.|Fist of the North Star, Glitch, Hokuto no Ken, one, Playstation

It's a series filled with twists and turns which completely flips the traditional conventions of it's genre upside down. There's really not much else that compares to it at the moment, and I've been all ears in-between episodes looking out for updates. So when it was today detailed on the official website for the My Hero Academia series just what we'd be up against as the series antagonist, we were wide-eyed and attentive. This season has been absolutely filled with tear-jerking action, and whilst it hasn't been all laughs for everyone, we're still yet to see any real antagonist development. Scattered throughout episodes we're served an occasional dose of teasers as to what's to come, but we're still largely left on our toes in anticipation. It would appear that wait is over however, as we're finally given our first look at what to expect, starting with the upcoming episode on June 10: If you tuned into the final episode of the first season, you might have noticed a briefly screened character in the last few seconds of the post-credits scene. Whilst we are yet to see him appear again, it would appear this is our antagonist of the season, Chizome Akaguro; perhaps better known as 'Hero Killer Stain'. His character is set to be voiced by Go Inoue, and will become a mainstay for most of the series moving forward. Whilst not much else was detailed, we'll be able to find out even more information about Hero Killer Stain following the upcoming episode on June 10.

11447|2017-06-04|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/playlist-003-sunny/| News | Music | playlist.003// Dreaming of Sunny Days | For the third entry into our playlist.// series, we channeled the electric sounds of Tokyo to bring forth the will to fight through this weeks weather. |This week in Tokyo is largely set to be defined by the wide-spread weather possibilities; spotty weather forecasted for Monday, Tuesday and Friday, with a windy Wednesday and rainy Thursday splashed in-between. It's a rollercoaster that will largely be broken down into two moods -- the desire to relax and the desire to move. Whilst the rain here in Tokyo may at time leave us all tired and wanting to rest, it also makes us long for the freedom to walk about and dance. In playlist.003//, we'll be focusing on these very emotions, pulling a large-array of inspiration from the electric sounds of Tokyo and beyond. Featuring artists such as Maltine Records' own yuigot and Hercelot, all the way to the hardcore sounds of artists such as DJ Shimamura, there's a lot lined up for the week ahead. So without further ado, let's get into things: Sunny Day Service - Blue Tank If there's anything that screams Summer more than Sunny Day Service's 'Blue Tank', you'll definitely need to let me know. It's a kick-back track blended with a quirky music video that defines the Summer vibes, colorful yet non-intrusive. I've definitely been seeing the group pop up in my feed more and more, especially following the June 2 release of their latest album 'Popcorn Ballads'. Frederic - Oddloop This is by no means a new song, but it is most definitely a track that's found itself a place back on repeat these last few days. Originally introduced unto the world back in late-2014, what is quite possibly Frederic's breakthrough song 'Oddloop' never fails to charm me. There's massive bonus points being thrown at it too given that, since I last checked, there's been official English subtitles added to the music video. Yuigot - MAGIC MAGIC (Hercelot little mix) Released through my all-time favorite label, Maltine Records, the multi-talented yuigot calls on fellow track maker Hercelot to remix his EP title-song 'MAGIC MAGIC'. Blending the EP's thematic candy-laced pop sound with Hercelot's youthful charm, we're given an absolute beautiful track that's been on repeat for weeks. Prism Paradise - Love Friend Style (DJ Shimamura's Hardcore Rave Remix) Calling on the all-stars of Tokyo's underground club scene, Prism Paradise is inviting us on a journey across multiple genres in it's latest compilation release. Of all the remixes on the release, by far the most standout to me was DJ Shimamura's hardcore rave remix of 'Love Friend Style' which plays on his signature sound tinted with a night at Akihabara's own Mogra. It's not the sort of song I'd normally be jamming to, with it stemming from an idol arcade series, but I'm an absolute sucker for DJ Shimamura's sounds, and that makes it all the more worth listening to. Hakushi Hasegawa - Nyuubi Yuge Hakushi Hasegawa isn't necessarily an artist that I've been following for an extended period of time, but that's all about to change. Their track 'Nyuubi Yuge' is a totally captivating adventure, and perfectly matches the current Tokyo landscape at this time of the year. It's an uptempo sound that has me equal parts relaxed and bouncing about, and I love every moment of it's almost 3 minutes 30 second duration. If you’re interested in checking out prior entries into our ongoing playlist.// series, you’ll find them here.|DJ Shimamura, Fredric, Hakushi Hasegawa, Hercelot, Maltine Records, Nyuubi Yuge, playlist.//, Prism Paradise, Sunny Day Service, yuigot
11448|2017-06-02|14:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/bitsummit-2017/| News | Games | BitSummit17 Exposes a Flourishing Japanese Indie Game Scene | BitSummit 2017 stood as an introduction to Japan's flourishing indie game scene which has been hidden away for much too long. |Recently, the world has been absolutely awash in amazing video games from Japanese developers across a magnitude of different genres. The windfall of fantastic games, seemingly starting with late 2016’s Final Fantasy XV and spanning titles like Nier: Automata, Nioh, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Persona 5 have been keeping our thumbs twitching. As a result, I’ve been hearing it all to often: “Japan is back. Japanese developers have found their magic touch once more.” I don't really buy into the sentiment, which honestly seems to assume a bit too much. In my eyes, the world of Japanese video games never actually lost its lustre; to the rest of the world, it simply fell out of focus as other trends and business decisions emerged from western markets and publishers. Remaining hyper-focused on the content we loved, myself and many other gamers found plenty to love from those same studios and talent who gave us some of our most fantastical experiences along the way. There was even room for new and unconventional games from young and budding talent. Imagine my sheer excitement then, if you will, when I discovered BitSummit - an annual showcase of some of the best games not only from Japan's own underground scene, but also from creative minds the world over who hope to spread their own concepts of fun across international barriers. From university students building their very first virtual reality games to industry veterans who have decided to chart their own paths with new production studios, BitSummit is a microcosm that allows the freshest ideas from one of our favorite hobbies to flourish and grow. This year's event, officially known as "A 5th of BitSummit," was held in Kyoto, Japan, at the Miyako Messe exhibition hall on Saturday, May 20 and Sunday, May 21. Organized by a host of big industry players alongside some individuals passionate about indie gaming, BitSummit is proud to be one of the largest independent games events in Japan, with 6435 attendees in 2016 alone. Throughout this years event, I was fortunate enough to get hands-on time with 10 games in total. Bridging various genres and niched ideas, we're going to take a look at just what defined my BitSummit weekend: People Panic People Panic was a game that would be extremely hard to miss as you entered the exhibit hall. As opposed to the gentle glow of all the TV screens and computer monitors dotting the dimly-lit hall, this light appeared to be popping out of the floor. As I approached to take a closer look, I was handed a long fishing rod-type pole, and noticed what appeared to be a classic flying saucer UFO hanging off the end. The goal of the game is to work with your teammates to abduct as many people, animals, and eventually objects as possible. Of course, as the image is not actually coming from the floor, an overhead projector works in tandem with the UFOs to determine where they are located on the playing field, thus allowing you to abduct anything below your own UFO. After 2 minutes or so of sucking up us much of the map as possible, everyone receives the total score, and a new round begins almost immediately. Of course, being quite an unconventional installation for a video game, it will be interesting to see how developer Coconoe brings the game to a wider audience. Official Site: 9ye.jp Strange Telephone Strange Telephone was, stylistically, one of my favorite games at the show. From the snap I captured above you can see main character Jill standing in front of this ominous looking door. As it would turn out, Jill is now trapped in this dark and mysterious world, and the only way to get out is to rely on her mysterious floating pal named Graham. Graham resembles a telephone, and Jill must use the hovering horn to dial up one a plethora of worlds via 6-digit numbers. It's a beautiful point-and-click adventure in a pixel art style, complete with retro scanlines and all. As you navigate the worlds, there are also a number of items that you can pick up to help you along the way. These include a lantern which light up those darker worlds, and a hatchet letting you cut through obstacles. I chatted with game's developer, Yuta, about his concept: Strange Telephone is a big game with 5 endings. In order to get them all, I encourage players to share their world numbers with friends to help them out. In this way, it is also a sort of social game, but you have to find a way to do this outside of the app. Strange Telephone is available now on both Android and iOS devices, in both Japanese and English. Also on display at the booth was a PC version, which is planned for release later this year. Official Site: magniflop.com Samurai Inferno Castle Now this one was just oozing with style and fresh ideas. The best way to describe Samurai Inferno Castle would have to be a blend between classic Japanese "yanki" biker gangs and Fire Emblem. On their turn, players are able to move their characters on gridded maps, and can chose from the standard options such as "Attack," "Item," and "Wait." The action is a fair bit more fast-paced than your typical SRPG, and taking down huge bosses requires you to be more inventive than approaching the enemy square and pressing "Attack." In the demo, I found myself facing a gigantic demon with two oversized arms. It was only after you incapacitated the arms that its head would emerge from behind the castle roof. In order to have myself in an advantageous position to strike the head, I had to move about placing bombs to damage the arms. If the rest of the game has you thinking on your feet in a similar style, I sense a real winner on our hands. Oh, and did I also mention there's an insanely fun multiplayer mode? Official Site: Kyoto x Unity Rising Arch: Raika kawaseshi shiren no tou Rising Arch is part-action, part-puzzle, and complete-fun. The game has two options when it comes to input; you can either take advantage of a touch screen monitor, or you can opt for a more traditional mouse and click scheme. It's clear which method the developers had in mind for the game however, as you are tasked with ascending a tower full of puzzles by hovering at precise points in midair, all while taking aim with your oversized magic bow to shoot down enemies. Tap once to warp, hold your finger to hover, and drag your finger back to aim and shoot your bow; easy. Just don't let go in the wrong spots, or else you may find yourself falling onto the spikes below. Featuring a host of characters, gorgeous pixel graphics and screen-engulfing effects, Rising Arch is sure to please fans of great 2D romps. The developers were selling special BitSummit emblazoned cards with download codes for trial versions of the game, and they detailed that the full version of the game is due out by year's end. I would urge you to keep an eye on their site and Twitter page for more info. Official Site: Banraku-Hatenkou va-ll hall-a (PlayStation Vita Version) va-ll hall-a, while perhaps not a new game for many, is receiving an official release in Japan complete with translation. So of course the indie darling should have a presence at Japan's biggest indie games show, right? Oh, and what's this? A PlayStation Vita release too? Sign me up! I played a good portion of their demo, and the game is just as sharply-written and witty in Japanese as it is English. Haven't given it a try yet? If you are a fan of incredibly detailed pixel graphics, brilliant writing and a general cyberpunk aesthetic, this game will be right up your alley. Oh, and props to the team for blaring the game's OST throughout the exhibition hall over a killer retro boombox. Official Site: Sukeban Games Save Me Mr. Tako! Did someone put a Game Boy on the big screen? You wouldn't be faulted for thinking so as you walked past this booth, as that's just the feeling that developer Christophe Galati wishes to evoke. Save Me Mr. Tako puts you in the tentacle-filled shoes of a little octopus soldier. Yes, these octopi are at war - with humans! The beginning of the demo had you attacking a human ship in the middle of a storm. One of the passengers of the ship falls into the sea, and through a cutscene your octopus jumps in after to save her. From here, the story unfolds as you guide the little rebel through some retro-inspired, hybrid platformer and RPG action. One of the best parts of the whole experience? You can swap the game's color palette on the fly with the press of a button, just as if you were playing an original Game Boy game on a Game Boy Advance, but with just a few more options. Save Me Mr. Tako will be available soon, with PC and WiiU releases planned. Official IndieDB Page: Save Me Mr. Tako Battle Sports Mekuru Perhaps even more joyous than playing the game itself was the official Battle Sports Mekuru tournament that BitSummit held on the main stage. With a brand-new Nintendo Switch up for grabs, teams of event ticket holders duked it out against some pretty big-name industry veterans. Featuring a star-studded lineup including Castlevania's own Koji Igarashi, it was hard not to root for the gamers from the audience who were competing against them. Battle Sports Mekuru is a Nintendo Switch-exclusive title developed by new Japanese studio Over Fence. The goal of the game is to run around a grid-like board, ground pounding the tiles to claim them as your own. With each pound, you flip a number of tiles in a cross-shaped pattern extending in all directions. Power-ups that you collect can have an effect on how many tiles you flip, and the pattern in which they flip as well. As you can imagine, this all makes for some pretty hectic action, and is the perfect game for a party-like setting. Just as many of BitSummit's presentations and stage events were streamed over Twitch, so too was the tournament. Players young and old, industry vets and gaming newcomers alike made this game a blast to watch, and it was even more enjoyable to try it out myself. It's currently available on the Japanese Nintendo Switch eShop, and I'm sure a worldwide release isn't too far off. Official Site: Battle Sports Mekuru Momodora V (Working Title) The game Momodora V may not see a final release under that same name, but what I played of it was a genuinely eye-catching example of stylized 3D action in it's purest form. Originally introduced as a direct sequel to the first four titles in the series, it quickly branched off instilling a series-first 3D approach to a once pixelated series. As I guided my character through a serene castle environment, I was met with tight controls and physics perhaps similar to an entry into the Dark Souls series. If anything says successful leap into 3D gaming, my guess is that would be a pretty good indicator. Since the game was revealed at the event, the developer has expressed intention in proceeding with this project separate from the Momodora series itself. Official Website: Bombservice God Breath You As we've already seen with titles like People Panic, BitSummit, as well as indie games scene itself is definitely not afraid to venture outside the realm of the usual with their games. God Breath You is a prime example of a game that can be just as fun, if not even more so, without any traditional input device like a controller. There are two aspects to the game: one player dons a VR helmet and finds themselves on a boat, while up to 4 other players squeeze little syringes attached to mini Roman-style busts in order to blow gusts of air at a small wooden model of aforementioned boat with a sensor attached to it. The player on the boat is essentially the captain, and must shout out directions such as "Left," Right," and Straight Ahead" in order to get the wind gods to steer the boat to safety. It was tons of fun, and I cannot wait to see what the team at 1->10drive bring to the table next. Official Developer Site: 1->10drive God of Money As I walked past this booth, it was admittedly not the game or the VR helmet that attracted me. Rather, it was a person standing nearby. That person just happened to be acclaimed developer of cult hit Deadly Premonition and D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die Swery65, or Mr. Hidetaka Suehiro. Of course, I just had to approach him for a chat, and during the course of our conversation I became insanely curious about this game he appeared to be monitoring. As it would turn out, it wasn't exactly his game per se, but he did have a hand in it. Thus, at the urging of Swery65, I was prompted to try out my very first (believe it or not) full VR game. God of Money is a project created by students at Osaka Electro-Communication University under Swery65's mentoring. He told me that VR was a prime space for young developers to bring their innovative ideas to fruition. After the Occulus Rift helmet was carefully attached to my head, the developers handed me the Occulus controllers, and explained the rules of the game. I only needed to grip one button, and it was as simple as throwing anything I might choose to toss in the real world. As a benevolent God of Wealth, you simply need to toss wads of cash to the masses scrambling about your perch. The physics were spot on, and I walked away a believer in our VR future. The next generation of creators are clearly in good hands. Official Facebook Page: VR Media Research Project Giga Wrecker You would honestly believe that a new title by the acclaimed studio Game Freak, the very same developers behind the best-selling Pokémon games, would be headline news, right? Well apparently I've either been under a rock, or this just slipped under everyones radar, as I was completely unaware of their latest title Giga Wrecker prior to BitSummit, which has been available in Japan since February 6, 2017. If there's anything I walked away knowing, it's that you need to head over to Steam pronto and pick up this gem, which just recently released with English-language support. Featuring a gorgeous art style reflective of the game's gritty nature, Giga Wrecker is described as a "debris action" game. The moniker totally fits, as it was a total blast to maneuver around the world, throwing junk around at will and bashing enemies with impromptu swords, spears and drills. Official Site: Giga Wrecker And so much more... Even though I dedicated almost an entire weekend at BitSummit, playing far more games than I could have at larger events such as E3 or Tokyo Game Show, I earnestly feel like I barely even scratched the surface. While there were some familiar faces from larger events such as Nintendo and PlayStation, this was very much a show for the little guys. But the presence of those larger companies undeniably shows their dedication to the scene, and that's always a good thing. Attached below is a series of photos from the showroom floor including the aforementioned booths from Nintendo and PlayStation: If you are interested in BitSummit and any future events that may be held, be sure to keep an eye on their official website here.|BitSummit, Games, indie, Nintendo, sony, Video Games
11452|2017-06-01|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/stuido-ghibli-theme-park/| News | Anime | There's a Studio Ghibli Theme Park Coming to Japan | There's an all-new Studio Ghibli theme park coming to Japan, and it's giving us a never before seen look into the world of My Neighbor Totoro. |Chances are that if you've been to Japan, you've probably made the sacred journey to the Ghibli Museum located in Mitaka, Tokyo. It's been the go-to destination for Ghibli fans since 2001, but we all knew that there was potential for so much more. That's why when it was announced by studio producer Toshio Suzuki that Studio Ghibli would be receiving it's own theme park located in Nagoya, we had every reason to be excited. That's where things got a little interesting however, especially when it comes to accessibility. For those who aren't familiar with the geographical layout of Japan, Nagoya is about 4 hours driving distance from Tokyo, and about an hour flight or bullet train ride. The park is being built on the former site of Expo Park, the location used during EXPO 2005, spanning roughly 185 acres. The park is going to be based around the world of childhood classic My Neighbor Totoro, with no word on some of our other favorites like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. Set to open around 2020, just in time for the Olympic tourism boom, we'll finally be receiving the theme park we've been waiting for since our first trip to Disneyland. There's a lot of potential for what it could become, but we'll have to wait a little bit longer before finding out more details. In the meantime though, let's take a look at some of the fan-made creations that could very-well go on to shape the theme park in the future: The image which was originally shared in early 2015 quite possibly gave us our first look at just what was possible in the realm of Ghibli theme parks. We've still got about 3 years until we'll finally be able to enjoy the park, but until then, we've got a whole lot to be excited about. What is it that you'd like to see at a Studio Ghibli theme park? Let us know in the comments below.|2020, Expo Park, Ghibli, Japan, My Neighbor Totoro, Nagoya, Studio Ghibli, Theme Park
11455|2017-05-31|10:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/fhana-live-report/| News | Music | report.// fhána - Looking for the World Atlas Tour 2017 | We attended the final leg of fhána's emotional rollercoaster 'Looking for the World Atlas Tour 2017' at Zepp Diver City here in Tokyo, Japan. |I've expressed it before and I'll express it again, anime music is getting really good. It feels like there's a fresh wave of talent paving their own paths in new and exciting ways. One of those talents in particular is fhána, a four-piece outfit that you've undeniably stumbled across at some point in your life. Perhaps best known for their recent 'Rhaspody of Blue Sky', the opening song to last seasons surprise-hit anime 'Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid', the band continues to innovate and excite with each new release. There wasn't an arcade in Tokyo that I could go to without hearing the stimulating theme, and I absolutely loved every moment of it. So when the opportunity to attend the final-leg of their 'Looking for the World Atlas Tour' at Zepp Diver City came up, there was no way I was going to let it pass. Taking place on May 12, 2017, the event was to be the conclusion to the bands nation-wide tour taking them from Hokkaido all the way to Fukuoka and back for a total of five live shows. It was obvious before even entering the venue that this was going to be a packed show, with lines wrapping all the way around the corner of the venue. This was unsurprising however, given just how popular the band has gotten as of late, with 'Rhaspody of Blue Sky' raking in over 8.6 million views. That's no small feat for any band. The air in the hall was dynamic, with fans curiously awaiting the bands on-stage appearance. Speculation all around, with concertgoers pondering just how the band planned to open their performance. That's when the lights dimmed, as the entire crowd around me burst out in excitement. Enter band member kevin mitsunaga; each step he takes onto stage rings, as the entire audience is fixated on his very presence. The vibrant chatter ceased, replaced with an eery silence questioning what was to come next. Without hesitation he stood behind his midi controller setup, setting off a chain reaction for what would be an incredible night. Much to everyones surprise, the band opted to not open with their most successful song, 'Rhaspody of Blue Sky', instead choosing to start with a powerful solo electronic performance from kevin mitsunaga. It was this sporadicalness that would go onto define the night, and would also be what would set them apart from every other live performance. The night was unlike any other, with each member of fhána maintaining a powerful onstage presence throughout the entire performance. The band flawlessly blended emotionally powerful interludes with energy-driven performances to create an exciting night for everyone involved. I've never seen a more dedicated crowd, crying for an encore not just once or twice, but a total of three times. Tears were shed and laughter was had, especially in the final moments of the performance where lead vocalist towana expressed her gratitude to everyone that helped them get to where they are now. Towards the end of the night, fhána would go on to announce their third studio album, as well as their latest music video for 'Relief' from their second album 'What a Wonderful World Line'. The concert as a whole was a powerful experience, and the bands dedication to their passion was prevalent throughout the whole performance. If you get the chance to check out the band live, I absolutely recommend you take the opportunity. I've gone ahead and embedded their latest music video below, so take the time to check it out: If you're interested in checking out more information on fhána, be sure to check out their official Facebook page, here.|2017, Diver City, fhana, Lantis, Looking for the World Atlas, Relief, Rhapsody of Blue Sky, UMAA, zepp, Maid Dragon

The all-metal DJ machine was a special guest at the mainstay “Synergy” event, which celebrated it’s 10-year anniversary by plucking an especially star-studded lineup straight out of Japan. Taking to the decks for roughly 20 minutes, DJ Domo’s on-stage presence was a force to be reckoned with. Spinning a set worthy of his programming, the crowd chanted his name in unison before he even got to the stage. If you’re not at all familiar with DJ Domo or his backstory, let’s fill you in a little. This rigorously built master of his craft is nothing to smirk at, regardless of his oversize body. When the acclaimed Dr.DJmachine assembled him to be a teacher in the art of DJ’ing, even he likely couldn’t have imagined just what he was unleashing on the world. Now you’ll find DJ Domo behind the decks, bringing the sounds of Japan’s club scene around the world faster than his batteries can run out. You can check out his full back-story below, courtesy of the team at NHK World: One day, Domo happens to pick up a record player in a forest and brings it back home, where his roommate Mr. Usaji has a wide collection of vinyls. Domo starts playing Mr. Usaji’s vinyls and slowly aspires to be a DJ. To make his dream come true, Domo visits a nightclub owner, but seeing Domo’s poor skill, the owner turns him down. Dr.DJmachine happens to see the disappointed Domo and ends up making a bipedal walking type robot that is “DJ Domo”, a great master of DJ, who becomes a great teacher of Domo. Tugging on the strings of childhood nostalgia, DJ Domo shines as a super quirky performance that truly blends some of the best aspects of Japan’s music scene with the sheer insanity of a giant Domo being behind the decks. Though his set only lasted some 20 minutes, the message the whole time was loud and clear. He knew exactly what he was doing, and it truly resonated in the reactions of the crowd. Starting his set with a prominent tribal sound, reminiscent of Japanese breakbeat duo Hifana, it didn’t take long before we were getting into the club sounds that had been blessing the hall all night long. It wasn’t until later on in the night that we would see DJ Domo again, as he graced the stage with his presence once more during Taku Takahashi’s powerful set. Dancing to the rhythm and the beat, it was a whole lot of fun for everyone involved. Later on in the convention, we were also fortunate enough to have DJ Domo conduct photograph sessions with convention attendees at the OTAQUEST booth, at least until his batteries ran dry. If you’re interested in checking out what DJ Domo will be up to next, be sure to check out his official website, here. |Acen 2017, Anime Central, DJ Domo, Domo, NHK World, Synergy, taku takahashi

She’s quite possibly one of the fastest growing independent artists to stem from the underground music scene, and represents a new wave of talent that has been gracing our online feeds for quite some time now. After spending a handful of her teenage years studying abroad, the aspiring artist returned to Japan more ready than ever for the path she was setting herself on. YUC’e is quite possibly unlike anyone else you’ve listened to in the past. Her vibrant style rings in each and every one of her releases, and I can’t help but feel an unwavering admiration for her ability to get herself out there. Fresh off the release of her sold out ‘macaron moon’ EP, as well as her recent international performance, I had the unique opportunity to sit down and have a brief chat with YUC’e for the third installment into our discussions.// series. So without further ado, let’s get to it: Before we get too into things, can you introduce the concept of YUC’e to us all? If I had to explain the concept of YUC’e, it would undeniably be an outlet for myself to express the things I love. It’s the alias in which I took on to share the sounds I have been enjoying. When I started, I was simply doing vocal covers of various pre-existing songs, and eventually started doing vocals for other artists music. This wasn’t enough though, and I knew that I could be doing so much more. So how was it you went from a cover artist to a producer? I was constantly inspired by those all around me, and I honestly just wanted to contribute something of my own to the music scene. I would listen to all the music I enjoyed and would spend hours on end teaching myself online how to create those sounds. This was definitely the starting point for me, as I then went on to create my own music. The big turning point for me was the release of my song Future Candy, which ended up bringing me to the attention of a lot of musicians. What was it about Future Candy that helped you get so recognized? When I first released Future Candy, I was totally overwhelmed by the support from artists here in Japan. Some of my idols like Kors K went as far as to share it as well, which was such an incredible feeling. The fact that I made remix stems and my vocals available for other producers too definitely helped a bunch. It’s was my favorite song, at least until ‘macaron moon’ came along. Where is it that you pull your inspiration from when making music? I pull a lot of inspiration from the people and friends all around me. I also listen to a lot of music online, and one of my favorite things to do is listen to one genre and think to myself “What would this genre sound good mashed up with?”. That’s how ‘macaron moon’ was made, I thought to myself that Jazz would go really well with glitch hop. Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of music production? If I’m not producing, I’m usually sleeping… I like anime and games a bunch, but I don’t really have any time to enjoy them properly. My absolute favorite anime would have to be Cardcaptor Sakura though, and I’m really excited for the new series that is starting next year! You mentioned that you have lived overseas before, tell us a little bit about that. I actually went to a boarding school in the United States for three years! It was in the middle of nowhere though, and there really wasn’t anything to do, so I just spent all of that time studying. Before that though I went to a language school in Australia, and then I went to another language school in Washington, D.C. You’ve recently played at Anime Central earlier this month, how was it? I had a whole lot of fun! I got to play with a lot of my musical idols, and all of their sets were super amazing. Chicago was super fun — I even got to eat deep dish pizza! The crowds were super friendly and receptive, and I can’t wait to go back to the US in the future! Finally, what can we expect to see next from you musically? I think I want my next release to have a more club-like feel to it, though I want it to be very melody driven at the same time. I want to see people jump and get excited on the dance floor while they’re listening to my music. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you!

11457|2017-05-29|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/cy8er-crowdfunding/| News | Music | CY8ER Raises Almost 4.5 Million Yen for Japan Live Shows | As the idol industry slowly begins it's generational transformation, units such as 'CY8ER' pave the way for a much brighter future. |I've never been a big fan of the Japanese idol industry, and that's just how things have been for quite some time. Though there's a few exceptions such as Dempagumi.inc, I just don't get the same kick out of them that I do a lot of other musicians over here. On the flip side however, I've always been a vocal fan of the Japanese club music scene, especially as of the last few years. So when I started to see the apparent merging of the two genres, I really wasn't sure what to think of it. That was of course, until groups such as BPM 15Q and CY8ER started to show up. CY8ER are an extremely unique case in the idol industry, and represent a new wave of talent that have been gracing our music feeds as of late. They helped usher in the "new idol sound", combining the hard-hitting sounds of the Tokyo club scene with curious lyrics and playful vocals. They're self-managed, and work closely with fellow Tokyo-based producer Yunomi to carefully craft their way to the top. But a large part of being an independent musical group is independently raising your own money, and that's where CY8ER turned to their fans for help. Earlier this month a campaign appeared on popular Japanese crowdfunding site Campfire from the group, calling on their fans for help. In a bid to conduct a series of shows across Japan, the group petitioned to raise two million yen. Of course, fans of the group weren't going to let it stop there, as the campaign now sits at a little under 4.5 million yen at the time of writing, with a full 24-hours remaining. Without overdoing it too much, this is such a refreshing thing to see, especially when it comes to the format in which the group approached this. As a result of the campaigns success, there were also some pretty sweet incentives unlocked too. From a new single and music video titled 'Kakushe-mu', a seemingly playful tribute to their former group BPM-15Q's 'Hakuchu-mu', all the way to their songs being included as background music at Family Mart. Of course, there's still some time until the campaign ends, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see even more announcements from the unit. I'm super excited to see what comes next from the group, and if you're interested in following their crowdfunding journey, you can check out the official webpage here.|BPM15Q, Campfire, crowdfunding, CY8ER, Idol, Live Show, tokyo, Yunomi
11458|2017-05-29|11:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/playlist-002-humidity/| News | Music | playlist.002// Rain, Humidity, and Uptempo Beats | For the second entry into our ongoing playlist.// series, we've channeled the sounds of Japan's eclectic music scene to fit the ever-changing landscapes. |If there's any two things that the Tokyo Summer season brings, it's rain and humidity. The season's quite honestly a hot mess, and it's got few redeeming factors outside of the incredible music that it brings forth. I don't know, I'm sure something about the blistering heat is enough to inspire anyone to stay inside and produce, right? This week, we'll be taking a look at a few tracks that have been on repeat for a while, and also happen to perfectly fit this weeks forecast. You see, there's no one label that could describe this week better than frantic, and our second entry into the playlist.// series aims to reflect that. Joining the playlist this week are six new acts, all crossing the borders into a variety of genres. From the math rock sounds of Kyoto's own tricot all the way to the sugar sweet sounds of Tomggg and Antenna Girl, this week has a lot going for it. So without further ado, let's look into this weeks playlist.//: Wednesday Campanella - Unico (UMA) Quite possibly one of Japan's quirkiest musical acts as of right now, the talented beyond belief three-piece electronic group Wednesday Campanella take this weeks crown. Their hit-track 'Unico', stemming from the groups 2016 album UMA, has finally received it's own music video, thus thrusting it back into the limelight. The actual song, which kicks in at about the 45 second mark, is accompanied by an entrancing video of group member KOM_I running about the streets totally enchanted by the rhythm. The song on it's own already made for an alluring adventure, but coupled with it's music video this is only amplified. tricot - Melon Soda (3) Quite possibly one of Japan's fastest growing acts internationally, tricot are an emotionally powerful math rock trio stemming from Kyoto, Japan. Released May 17, the band's 3rd album carefully builds on the three members visual and lyrical identity. This is especially prevalent in the closing track 'Melon Soda', accompanied by it's gorgeously executed music video directed by Mani Kato. Though it's probably not for everyone, there's absolutely no denying the talent of tricot as they continue to reach new heights both domestically and internationally. fhána - Relief If you checked out last seasons surprise hit Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, you've definitely heard of Japanese outfit fhána. The group were responsible for the anime's over-the-top opening theme song, 'Rhaspody of Blue Sky', and have since gone on to do a nationwide tour of Japan and announce a third album. It really does seem like there's no stopping them, and their latest music video for 'Relief' only further solidifies this fact. Utilizing completely English lyrics, the song stands as proof of the bands diverse talent pool. Happy Kuru Kuru - Magical Girl Let's talk about Happy Kuru Kuru for a little, with a special focus on their latest track 'Magical Girl'. Much like last weeks CY8ER, Happy Kuru Kuru is a Yunomi-produced idol unit stemming from Tokyo, Japan. What makes this unit so different however is the duo's much harder-hitting production and increasingly more eccentric vocals. Each of their releases packs a massive punch, and Magical Girl is absolutely no exception. It's bouncy-theme will have you moving up and down for the whole day, with a guarantee that the track is going to get stuck in your head. Tomggg - SUPERSTAR (feat. Antenna Girl) Quite possibly the perfect accompaniment to the upcoming rainy days, Tomggg has teamed up with fellow artist Antenna Girl for their latest release, 'SUPERSTAR'. The best way to describe both musicians sounds would be the search for beauty in delicacy. Coupling Antenna Girl's soft vocals with Tomggg's carefree production, we're presented with a calming journey that embodies both creatives unique and compelling styles. YOANI 1年C組 - Ojisan (Yunomi Remix) Speaking of all these Yunomi-produced idol units, it's probably about time we actually present one of his own works, or at least one of the many remixes he's created. Ojisan is the debut single from emerging idol group YOANI 1年C組 which was totally flipped on it's head in this Yunomi remix. By combining his frantic production style with the somewhat hilarious lyrics of the original track, we're graced with this incredible piece of art.

11460|2017-05-26|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/investigation-002-anime-america/| News | Anime | investigation.002// Looking Into Anime in North America | Taking a glance back, I can say with confidence that the anime industry has come a long way since it's initial Western popularization in the early 90's. |Taking a glance back, I can say with confidence that the anime industry has come a long way since it's initial Western popularization in the early 90's. Gone are the days of VHS collecting and irregular release schedules, replaced instead by the highly efficient streaming structure that we have now adopted. In almost realtime, we as fans are able to log online and watch our favorite anime just moments after Japanese release, something that could have only been dreamed about some 15 years ago. For the second installation into our investigation.// series, we'll be looking at the current state of anime in North America as of the Spring season. Prompted by the recent infographics shared by Crunchyroll, we're able to see just what fans are enjoying on a state by state basis. Furthermore, we'll be investigating just what this could mean for the industry as it continues to press forward as a global entertainment mainstay. If you haven't yet had a chance to check out the infographics recently released by the team at Crunchyroll, they were designed to outline just what series each area in the US have been enjoying the most from the current season. Split into two infographics, the images give us a deeper insight into just how the medium is currently being consumed in the US. The first visual breaks down a state by state outline of what shows are performing the best this season, and well, the results are pretty much what you'd expect them to be: It comes as no surprise that the mammoth second season of Attack on Titan would be the most streamed anime, followed only by Boruto and My Hero Academia. Both in Japan and internationally, Attack on Titan has been an absolute wrecking force, building upwards from the momentous hype created by it's first season. Boruto on the other hand finds itself as a familiar face in a new territory, working off the success of it's predecessor Naruto without actually sharing it's name. Looking at this map however, there's one fatal issue -- everything is a sequel of a pre-existing anime. This is where the second visual swoops in to save the day, offering us an insight as to what new anime have been performing best in each state. Now this is a little better. If you're anything like me, you probably like to see a little diversity in your anime rankings. While I knew series like Attack on Titan will be taking first place, I'm more interested in the new series that have been taking North America by storm. Coming in at a total of seventeen states, Akashic Records has managed to strike through as this seasons most watched, non-sequel anime. This is where I was a little surprised however, seeing Granblue Fantasy hit such a high note amongst international audiences. The mobile game gone anime has been the topic of much discussion amongst myself and many others here in Japan, so I was excited to see it place on the map. So what does this all actually mean? Well, it informs us that the United States has an unwavering appreciation for the series it already knows and loves. Outside of that however, it shows that we're starting to see a broader range of acknowledgement spreading across all genres. This all of course stems back to the topic of accessibility, and with the progress that is being made in that department, more and more individuals are able to find the series that most suits them. It's through this accessibility that we're seeing some pretty major strides forward globally, and it's legitimately exciting to see what comes next for the industry. The biggest part of the growth of anime on a global scale will always come down to how easy it is to access. If there's several different series that several different groups will appreciate, it's important that all of them can be viewed. This is very much starting to become the case, especially as of the last few years, and if anything, we have the legal streaming services that make this all possible to thank. Without them it's highly unlikely that anime would ever be anywhere near the size it is today outside of Japan, as hordes of fans tune in to witness series such as Attack on Titan and Akashic Record.

11461|2017-05-24|10:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/discussions-002-kiato/| Interview | N/A | discussions.002// From Sketchbook to Reality With Kiato | We sit down with budding Tokyo-based illustrator 'Kiato' as she sketches her way to the top of the underground Japanese illustration scene. |If you've at any point been following my monthly 'Twitter Illustrator' series, then you've definitely seen the name Kiato pop up once or twice before. She's the creative mind behind some of Tokyo's most vibrant illustrations, and today I had the unique opportunity to sit down with her for the second installment of our discussions.// series. Kiato is an illustrator who was introduced to me as somewhat of a package deal. I originally discovered her illustrations around the year 2015, which was the same time I discovered budding producer Yunomi. The two are totally inseparable, and have been long time collaborators through their art. I've been a long time fan of Kiato's illustrations, but regardless of what language you search in, it's quite difficult to find out too much about her as an individual. Every creative has a story, and I was insistent on learning hers. Sitting down, we discussed her interests outside of art, where she came from, as well as some of her favorite things to do in the Tokyo area. So without further ado, here's discussions.002//: To start things off, can you tell me a little bit about who Kiato is? Well, Kiato is me. It’s a project that I guess I’ve been unknowingly working on since I was a kid, but that’s far removed from where I’m at now. I’m an illustrator who frequently collaborates with various musicians such as Yunomi, Happy Kuru Kuru, and a long-list of others. It was around the age of 18 that I started taking art seriously, which lead me to my current position where I’m doing it full-time. What are some of your interests outside of the realm of illustrating? I’m a big fan of films, especially horror and dark fantasy films. I like a lot of foreign films as well, and also Disney/Ghibli films. Some of my all-time favorites would have to be “Pan’s Labyrinth”, “Girl, Interrupted”, and “Ai no Mukidashi”. I listen to a lot of music, and I also like exploring the Harajuku area. Some of my favorite spots there would have to be Laforet, Park Harajuku, and anywhere that sells pancakes. I also like playing a lot of video games and watching anime. On that topic, what are some your favorite anime and video games? Lately I’ve been playing a lot of Mario Kart 8 on the Nintendo Switch, but one of my all-time favorites is definitely a Japanese game called Euphoria. It's a little dark, and definitely not for kids, but I really like it. Other than that I'm a big fan of the Pokémon series. My favorite Pokémon are definitely Togepi, Mew and Pikachu. For anime, I’m a really big fan of series like Sailor Moon and Digimon. Though if I had to choose between Digimon or Pokémon, I think Pokémon would win. Where is it that you pull inspiration from when working on illustrations? I get a lot of my inspiration from the things going on all around me. I’m a big fan of Harajuku fashion, so a lot of my drawings pull inspiration from brands like Chloma, as well as anyone else putting out clothing I find cute. In terms of illustrators that inspire me, there’s a few I can name off the top of my head. Hiroyuki Takei, the creator of Shaman King is a major inspiration, as well as Watanabe Akio who designed the Monogatari characters. Can you tell me a little bit about the area you came from? I’m originally from Fukoka, which is about 13 hours drive from Tokyo. It was a nice area, but I found that there wasn’t much opportunity there for what I wanted to do. So I began job hunting, and eventually found work in Tokyo where I could truly flourish. It was at that point in which I moved to Tokyo. As for your illustration process, how do you go about creating each piece of art? I draw each illustration with pen and paper, and then later process it through photoshop for editing. That’s how I’ve done all my pieces, it’s a process we call “analog to digital” here in Japan. What would you like to do in the future as an illustrator? I’d love to create a music video sometime in the future. I don’t want it to be one that’s 2D superimposed onto the real world, rather, I want it to be a purely animated music video. Something in the style of an ORESAMA music video is what I want to create. If I did make anything though, it would likely be for one of Yunomi’s songs. I’d also like to make a doujin to sell somewhere like Comiket at some point too. Thank you for your time! Thank you very much. With little more than a pen and textbook at her side, as well as the support of countless fans, we're excited to see where Kiato takes herself next. We're also very excited to share the special self-illustration she drew for the interview, which can be found below. If you're interested in checking out more of Kiato's incredible illustrations, you can find her on both Twitter and Tumblr. |discussions.//, illustrator, interview, kiato, Yunomi
11464|2017-05-23|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/dragon-quest-eye-drops/| News | Games | There's Now "Dragon Quest" Slime Eye Drops. Because Why Not. | We recently received our first look at the joint project between Japanese eye drop brand 'Z! Pro' and popular video game series 'Dragon Quest'. |There's a lot of weird collaborations that go on over here in Japan, and contrary to popular belief, there's also a lot of normal ones too. Leaning more towards the former this time however, we get our first look at the joint project between Japanese eye drop brand Z! Pro and popular video game series Dragon Quest. I can't say I've ever personally had to use eye drops, but I'm sure for those of you who do, you like them to remind you of your favorite video game series... right? Perhaps one of the most recognizable characters in the Dragon Quest universe, the "Slime" has appeared in every mainline entry into the video game franchise. Slime has always been instantly distinguishable, characterized by it's signature blue body and wide, goofy smile. A low-level character designed to commonly appear throughout the game, it's guaranteed that if you've ever picked up the series you've encountered one during your journeys. Tugging right at the strings of my childhood nostalgia, I absolutely love this concept. To give some background to the whole collaboration, Dragon Quest is currently celebrating it's 30th anniversary. So of course, who else would a video game series choose to collaborate with other than one of Japan's largest eye drop brands. If you're not familiar with Rohto, the company that creates the Z! Pro series of eye drops, you may have even seen some of their North American products in places like CVS and Walmart. That being said, I'm absolutely certain you won't be seeing these in said North American stores any time soon. These are set to be releasing in Japan come May 27, and will feature a redesigned casing for the eye drops in the form of a Slime's body. The adorable blue friend will be coming in at around $5 USD, as the product presents itself as a quirky alternative to traditional eye drops. The packaging on the inside will also feature a major throwback to the original games UI, further driving home the uniqueness of this product. Available at most pharmacies across Japan, you can find out further information via the official website.|30th Anniversary, Collaboration, Dragon Quest, Little Friend, Rohto, Slime, Z! Pro
11462|2017-05-23|11:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/osomatsu-birthday/| News | Anime | The Osomatsu-san Birthday Video is a Sugary Sweet Treat | Today we gather around to celebrate one of the most important days of the year, the Osomatsu-san sextuplets birthday celebration! |Today is a very important day; possibly even the most important day. It's a day which only comes once a year, and usually means total chaos for everyone involved. If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking of course about the Matsuno sextuplets birthday! That's not just one or two birthdays, that's five very important birthdays, and one lesser important birthday (though we'll leave that latter comment to your own imagination). An essential part of any birthday is the all-important birthday cake, and that's where today's video comes into play. Uploaded onto YouTube today by Avex Pictures, we received a special celebratory video centered around the creation of a sugar sweet Osomatsu-san birthday cake. In what is almost a yearly tradition at this point, especially following last years 'SIX SAME FACES ~TONIGHT IS THE BEST!!!!!!~ -BIRTHDAY REMIX-', we gather around our devices and celebrate. The birthday video, which utilizes stop motion animation techniques, is a collaborative project with Japanese animation studio dwarf. The studio is perhaps best known for their previous works with characters such as Domo-kun and Rilakkuma. Running for roughly 45 seconds in duration, the birthday film was shot over a total of 1,000 individual cuts. Accompanying the clip is a revamped version of last years birthday anthem, aptly titled 'SIX SAME BIRTHDAY 2017 ~BIRTHDAYS ARE THE BEST~¡¡¡¡¡¡'. The concept behind the six upside down exclamation points represents six candles, according to Avex. On April 6 it was announced that the series would be receiving a second season, to which there is yet to be any further news announced. There's honestly few animated series right now that have me as excited as Osomatsu-san, so any emerging news is always welcome to me. If you're interested in checking out more from the Osomatsu-san series, I recommend picking it up for streaming on Crunchyroll ahead of the release of the second season, here.|avex, Birthday, dwarf, Fujio Akatsuka, May 24, Osomatsu-san, Osomatsu, Mr. Osomatsu
11463|2017-05-23|08:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/new-non-non-biyori/| News | Anime | A New 'Non Non Biyori' Anime Project Has Been Announced | The newly-released 11th volume of Atto's Non Non Biyori manga came packaged with a wrap-around sleeve announcing that a new anime project is in the works. |In much the same carefree way in which the characters of Non Non Biyori go about their lives in the Japanese countryside, Kadokawa have announced a brand-new anime project in the beloved feel-good series. The newly-released 11th volume of Atto's Non Non Biyori manga came packaged with a wrap-around sleeve announcing that a new anime project is in the works. It remains to be seen whether this means a new TV-length 3rd cour, or perhaps a film project. The anime which played an essential part in my 2013 Winter follows the life of Hotaru as she transitions from her big-city lifestyle to her new small-town setting due to her fathers work. The full synopsis of the series can be found below: When Hotaru transfers from a school in bustling Tokyo to a tiny school in a quiet country village, she’s in for a big adjustment. Although her new school only has five students, there's something about the laidback lifestyle that makes her feel right at home. It's a big change from the big city, but there are still plenty of new adventures to look forward to with her quirky new friends as Hotaru learns that “home” really is where the heart is. The official Twitter account posted the following tweet this morning: ビッグニュースなん！な、なんと新作アニメ制作決定なのん！やったのーん！！今後の情報をぜひ期待してほしいんなー！うちも楽しみなのん！ #なのん pic.twitter.com/om8qFyo2hl — 「のんのんびより」公式PRツイッター (@nonnontv) 23 May 2017 Big news-nan!

11465|2017-05-22|17:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/galaxxxy-us-sizes/| News | N/A | Shibuya-based Fashion Brand 'Galaxxxy' is Testing US Sizes | In an announcement that went live on social media, Galaxxxy shared that they'd be testing limited runs for US sizing on a select few articles of clothing. |I think I speak for a lot of people when I say there's a certain level of dissapointment when you see an incredible article of 'one-size' clothing from a Japanese brand, only to have it be too small. It's generally not a good feeling, but nothing outweighs the dissapointment of not being able to walk out of the store in that new top. That's where Shibuya-based fashion brand 'Galaxxxy' is stepping in. In a recent announcement that went live on their social media accounts, they shared that they'd be testing limited runs for US sizing on a select few articles of clothing. This is pretty major news, especially with Galaxxxy being one of my all-time favorite brands. The two articles of clothing that are currently being tested are the brands signature 'Gala-chan' shirts, as well as the 'Sexy Cat Girl' mascot shirts. It's likely that based on the performance of these two, the brand may look at making future releases available in US sizing as well. This is massive news, especially for those of us who have been following the brand for any period of time. Lately the brand has been commanding a large presence at North American conventions, so any steps taken to accommodate their international followers are always appreciated. To date the brand has largely operated on a 'one-size' system, which is considered standard amongst smaller brands within Japan. As Galaxxxy looked towards international releases however, it was obvious that this wasn't going to work for long. The news comes closely in time with the brands 10th anniversary, having originally been founded in 2007. Throughout those 10 years, the brand has collaborated with properties such as Adventure Time, Dragon Ball Z, Ultraman, and even international artists such as Porter Robinson. It's been a wild ride for the company, and this announcement gives me some serious hope for their international presence in the years to come.

11466|2017-05-22|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/sanrio-collaborations/| News | Anime | The Colorful World of Sanrio Anime Collaborations | In a successful bid to remain culturally relevant, Sanrio often finds itself working alongside popular animated series for collaborative merchandise. |While I can't necessarily say that the Sanrio craze is at an all time high, I can definitely say that the company has been pulling some really big moves in the last few years. Whether you're familiar with Sanrio as a company or not, you're most definitely familiar with their characters. From Hello Kitty to Gudetama and even the adorable Little Twin Stars, I'm not kidding when I say they're a pretty big deal. This is especially prevalent here in Japan where the company still commands a dedicated nationwide following. In a successful bid to remain culturally relevant in Japan's ever-evolving society, Sanrio often finds itself working alongside popular animated series for collaborative merchandise. One of my favorite examples of this is the Osomatsu-san collaboration that took place in Japan at the start of 2017. For this project, the company worked closely with the anime series to capture each of the 'Matsu brothers personalities within a Sanrio character. The collaboration even fabricated it's own story, which followed each brothers desperate ploy to find a girlfriend. After they witness the impressive sway of the Sanrio characters, they approach Prof. Dekapan begging him to craft a transformative potion allowing them to become the embodiment of Sanrio characters. It's a super cute addition to the already great story of Osomatsu-san, and is exactly the kind of thing I like to see. I've gone ahead and embedded the video below: Now I'm not saying that Twitter holds the same value as something like an official financial report, but if the official Yuri!!! on ICE Twitter is anything to go by, then there's a strong chance Sanrio has found it's next big collaboration. Pairing up with the popular animated series, the initial collaboration announcement tweet would go on to reach over 21,000 favorites and almost 18,000 retweets without any details actually being shared. That's an undeniably impressive feat for both parties involved. This also coincides with the announcement of the upcoming Yuri!!! on ICE film that series creator Sayo Yamamoto is currently hard at work on. 「ユーリ!!! on ICE × サンリオキャラクターズ」のコラボが決定！！どのサンリオキャラとコラボするのか乞うご期待です #yurionice pic.twitter.com/nJX8CYC5TJ — TVアニメ「ユーリ!!! on ICE」 (@yurionice_PR) 10 May 2017 So what comes next for the beloved, now almost 57 year old company is a mystery. Over the past weekend I took the opportunity to visit a few of their character stores in Harajuku, where the flow of both locals and tourists was consistently busy. The little things such as Facebook and Line stickers are certainly helping revitalize and develop the companies international following, though it would certainly be great to see a few more collaborative projects make it overseas. If you're ever in Japan and get the opportunity, be sure to check out what's happening in the world of Sanrio, as there's a strong chance that there will be a collaborative event going on.

11469|2017-05-22|09:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/playlist-001-tokyo-summer-heat/| News | Music | playlist.001// Introduction to the Tokyo Summer Heat | It's getting hot here in Tokyo, and I'm not just talking about the emerging Summer heat. |It's getting hot here in Tokyo, and I'm not just talking about the emerging Summer heat. Beyond the fact that last Sunday was the hottest recorded day of the year for my area, this new season has a whole lot going for it. There were a lot of different reasons that I initially moved to Tokyo, but if I'm completely honest, it was the music scene that trumped all else. Tokyo is this incredible melting pot of talent, and much like the countries seasons, it's constantly changing. Our new weekly playlist.// series will be your curated source for some of Japan's greatest emerging musical talent, as well as a few established artists splashed in-between. Every Monday we'll be starting your week off with a bang, introducing you to a handful of new and returning music that aims to shape the soundtrack for your week. Bridging a wide-variety of genres and sub-cultures, we aim to introduce domestic talent that will increase awareness of the diverse skillset of Japan's music scene. So without further ado, here's your first weekly playlist.//: tofubeats - BABY (Fantasy Club) I've said it before, I've said it again, and now I'm going to say it once more; if you haven't listened to Kobe-based producer and creative tofubeats, this seriously needs to change. Not too long ago I wrote about the release of the music video for 'BABY', a track which has certainly evolved from it's original form that was uploaded on SoundCloud some two years ago. Taken from tofubeats forthcoming album Fantasy Club, 'BABY' places itself as a serious contender for one of the artists greatest tracks. CY8ER - 手と手 After recently making headlines for wearing hazmat suits to their own fan meet-and-greet session, chances are you've heard of CY8ER. Don't let that fool you however, as they're so much more than a headline grabbing gimmick. The Yunomi-produced idol group combines high-energy vocals with eclectic production value to craft their debut music video, 'Te to Te'. If this is a sign of what's to come from CY8ER, we've most definitely got a lot to be excited about. ORESAMA - オオカミハート (F.O ver.) As passionate as I am about the Japanese music scene, often there's some legitimate talent that slides under my radar for an extended period of time, and Tokyo-based duo ORESAMA are a perfect example of this. Combining gorgeous animations with equally appealing vocals and instrumentals, ORESAMA craft an immersive Summertime landscape through their music. YUC'e - Night Club Junkie (macaron moon EP) Chances are if you were able to make your way to the Synergy 10th Anniversary Party at Anime Central this last week, you're probably still reeling in from this track. YUC'e is an incredibly talented producer and vocalist who absolutely knows how to get the crowd moving. Her latest track 'Night Club Junkie' is no exception, combining lush vocals with high production quality to ensure that whether you're in the club or at your day job, you'll be grooving along. Ujico*/Snail's House - Lullaby (Ordinary Songs 3) In our recent interview with Ujico*/Snail's House, he went on to share how he considered 'Lullaby' to be one of his all time greatest tracks. The adorable composition makes for the perfect accompaniment to any Summer time nap, and that's why it was an essential inclusion for this list. Stemming from Ujico's upcoming Ordinary Songs 3, the third-installment into his largely popular Ordinary Songs series, there's a whole lot to look forward to in the coming months. ClariS - ヒトリゴト (you Remix Short Ver.) If you've been tuning into Eromanga Sensei at all this season, you're absolutely familiar with it's ridiculously catchy OP song from ClariS. The anime has been a guilty pleasure of mine, with each episodes airing time being a sacred ritual amongst myself and the friends that I live with. Of course, it was only a matter of time before the J-core community got their hands on the track, working their magic and flipping it into an absolute essential for both clubs and commutes alike.|ClariS, CY8ER, ORESAMA, playlist.//, Snail's House, tofubeats, tokyo, Ujico, you, YUC'e
11470|2017-05-19|07:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/investigation-001-itano-circus/| News | Anime | investigation.001// The Madhouse of the "Itano Circus" | For our first installment of 'investigation.//', we look into the visually eccentric world of Ichiro Itano, and the use of his 'Itano Circus' technique. |Welcome to investigation.//, a new weekly text-based series scheduled for every Friday that aims to dig into various aspects of Japan's numerous niche cultures and trends. Starting off with a bang, we'll be investigating the little-known, widely-used phenomenon that is the 'Macross Missile Massacre', more correctly known as the 'Itano Circus'. What was once a humble animation technique used by pioneer Ichiro Itano, has rapidly transformed into a mainstay of modern animation, even branching out into various aspects of Western filmmaking. The 'Itano Circus' is a specialized animation technique originally used by Ichiro Itano during his work on the 1980 anime series 'Space Runaway Ideon'. It was a stylistic and visually pleasing approach to the traditional single-projectile fight sequence, totally revolutionizing what fans would come to expect from the anime industry. Characterized by the dynamic flight patterns of its projectiles, as well as the overall sheer ridiculousness of the attack, the visual overload quickly caught on within the animation world and beyond. Introduced at a time where fight scenes were still presented utilizing sudden cuts and slow-paced movements, Itano's high-speed action scenes were a welcome addition to a slowly evolving industry. With all this being said, what exactly is the 'Itano Circus'? Put simply, it's an all-out missile attack that pays no mind to contemporary rules. By launching an unconventional volley of missiles, rather than a single unit, it not only enables for an initial visual flurry of smoke and metal, but also enables intense 3D movement scenarios from the unit being attacked. A powerful example of this would be the 2001 'Cowboy Bebop: The Movie' where Spike is being chased down by a multitude of missiles in the Swordfish II. Not only is he tasked with maneuvering his ship through each and every missile, but he must also work through his surrounding terrain. The end result is a gripping It comes as no surprise of course that this scene in particular worked so well, especially with Itano himself maintaining the role of key animator for the film. Pulling from the top of my head I could easily name a handful of titles who have gone on to utilize the technique over the years. From the Evangelion rebuilds in which Ichiro Itano himself worked on, all the way to less-likely series such as Pokémon, the untold influence Itano has had on the industry is truly remarkable. A great example of the techniques influence on the West is in the early stages of Marvel's first Iron Man film in which Tony Stark is demonstrating his new 'Jericho Missile'. Pulling away from its animated roots, the scene introduces a devastating horde of missiles launching out of a single unit, something once only seen in series such as Macross some 25 years prior. To date, Ichiro Itano is still credited as one of the greatest animators within his own field. Analyzing what was available to him, and what he could do with it, Itano would go on to reinvent a decade old formula allowing for genuine, long-lasting progress to be made. Passing his legacy along, Itano would go on to inspire fellow creatives such as Yasuhi Muraki and Hirofumi Masuda. What the now 58 year old creatives next move will be, only time can tell. With more and more experimentation going on in the industry now than ever before, perhaps it won't be long before the next 'Itano Circus' is discovered. So what are your thoughts, are you a fan of the high-paced animation technique?|investigation.//, investigation, Itano Circus, Ichiro Itano, Macross Missile Massacre, Mecha, Missiles
11358|2017-05-17|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/tower-records-dai-sato/| News | N/A | Record Shopping at Tower Records With Dai Sato | Yesterday, I had the unique opportunity to go record shopping at the famed Shibuya Tower Records alongside Dai Sato, divulging our musical interests. |It's been a very busy week for the whole team at OTAQUEST, especially with Anime Central just around the corner in the city of Chicago. But just because things are busy, doesn't mean there's no room for some downtime. Yesterday, I had the unique opportunity to go record shopping at the famed Shibuya flagship Tower Records alongside Dai Sato, divulging our musical interests and tastes. He's a fan of many genres, pulling particular inspiration from both shoegaze and electronic genres respectively. Unafraid to experiment with new sounds, he dove head first into some of my suggestions, and the results proved quite interesting. If you're not familiar with Dai Sato as a creative, you're most definitely familiar with his works. Dai is the person behind some of the greatest anime of the last century, including series such as Eureka Seven, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. Each and every one of these animated series, while being known for their intricate stories, are especially known for their beautifully constructed soundtracks. So when it comes to music, I'm definitely all ears towards Dai's tastes. Making our way from the 6th floor downwards, we browsed through a selection of jazz and hip hop, both old and new. The theme of todays trip was "Summertime vibes", so we wanted something that would fit the moods of the changing seasons here in Tokyo. The first thing that caught my eye was the 2016 "Awaken, My Love!" from Childish Gambino. I painted an image of the album for Dai, additionally mentioning Donald Glovers upcoming role as Lando Calrissian. This is where it clicked for him, being a long time star wars fan, as he put the album in his cart. Moving forward, we headed down to the stores fifth floor which was populated by a diverse mix of new age artists with a splash of club music. It would be this floor that we arguably spent most of our time, looking through the various releases from the last decade. As the former owner of his own electronic label, Frogman Records, Dai has a distinct and somewhat specific taste when it comes to music of the genre. Before that however, there was a large-scale display for a few recent new age releases from artists that Dai was quite fond of. From Hoops, a four-piece band stemming from Bloomington, Indiana, all the way to the ecstatic pop sounds of Petite Meller, there was a lot to discuss. Towards the back of the floor I introduced Dai to some of my favorite club sounds stemming from Tokyo. I'm not the type of person you'd generally find in a club, regardless of my musical interests. Unless it's on the odd occasion where I'm supporting a friend, I find a lot more joy listening to club sounds from the comfort of my own room. That's where In The Blue Shirt comes into play. The Kyoto-based producer has worked closely with Japanese net-labels such as Maltine Records and Trekkie Trax, crafting his own unique sound filled with dreamy vocal chops and an entrancing beat. Closing out the trip was the recently released 'The Days We Had', the debut album from Day Wave. The Oakland, California-based band consisting of a single member are currently on tour throughout both Europe and North America. Their 80's-influenced, synthesizer and guitar driven tracks had caught the attention of Dai, making this an easy purchase for this trip. I've gone ahead and broken down the full list of purchases below: Childish Gambino - "Awaken, My Love!" || December 2016, Glassnote Records. || Stream/Purchase Hoops - Routines || May 2017, Fat Possum Records || Stream/Purchase Petite Meller - Lil Empire || September 2016, Island Records || Stream/Purchase In The Blue Shirt - Sensation Of Blueness || October 2016, Trekkie Trax || Stream/Purchase Day Wave - The Days We Had || May 2017, Harvest Records || Stream/Purchase Kashif - BlueSongs || May 2017, Billboard Records || Stream/Purchase |Dai Sato, Eureka Seven, tower records, Childish Gambino, Hoops, Petite Meller, In The Blue Shirt, Day Wave, Kashif
11353|2017-05-17|12:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/eureka-seven-release-date/| News | N/A | Eureka Seven: Hi-Revolution Voice Actors & Release Revealed | Officially set to release in Japanese theaters on September 16, 2017, we're finally given our first look at Eureka Seven's voice actors. |It's been five years now since Eureka Seven last graced our screens in the form of Eureka Seven: AO. It wouldn't be until earlier this year that we'd hear anything of the series, as Studio Bones went on to announce a trilogy of films retelling the original animated series. We were given a timeframe of each films release, spreading from 2017 through until 2019 with a release slated for each year. I was ecstatic when that news was announced and I'm equally ecstatic now, as we're finally given a solid release date for the first entry into the trilogy 'Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution'. Slated for a September 16, 2017 release, the first entry into the trilogy will be set 10 years after the 'Summer of Love' catastrophe. Following the story of Renton Thurston, it will detail his encounter with Eureka as they begin their interstellar journey together. Accompanying the news of the films release date, we also got our first look at the voice actors for the trilogy. I've gone ahead and shared them below: Returning to voice protagonist Renton Thurston is Yuuko Sanpei. Outside of her work with the Eureka Seven series, she's best known for being the voice of characters such as Boruto Uzumaki from 'Boruto -Naruto Next Generations-' and Nozomi Yumehara from 'Yes! Precure 5'. Her comment regarding the film can be found below: Thanks to all of your love towards the Eureka series, this trilogy could be made. I really can't express my gratitude. I'm excited to take on the role of Renton once more, as I fall in love with Eureka once more. So to all my fellow Renton's in the world, let's fall in love once again. Also returning to take on the role of Eureka once more is Kaori Nazuka. It would seem that since originally appearing in Eureka Seven in 2005, that Kaori Nazuka has gone on to tackle a multitude of major roles in the anime industry. From My Hero Academia all the way to Space Dandy, it truly feels as if anything she touches is destined for greatness. You can find her comment regarding the upcoming film below: Thank you so much for supporting me over all these years. I'm so glad that I can work on Eureka Seven alongside my favorite team of people. This is all thanks to those who have continued to support the series since the beginning! I'll be working my absolute hardest, and I'd be pleased if fans see the trilogy through to the end. Returning for the first time since the original animated series, Kouji Tsujitani will once again take on the role of former lieutenant Dewey Novak. Outside of his work with the Eureka Seven series, he is best known for his roles in animated classics such as Mobile Suit Gundam 0080 and Mobile Suit Gundam F91. His comment can be found below: After more than 10 years, I've finally come to realize the importance of my involvement in this work. The fact that this project is being made into a film is purely because it is so loved by its fans. Because the film will be made into a trilogy, we will continue to devote ourselves and go beyond expectations! Joining the team for the first time will be Toshiyuki Morikawa, who recently voiced Kira Yoshikage in the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable animated series. He'll be taking on the role of Gekkostate leader Holland Novak throughout the trilogy of films. His comments can be found below: Eureka Seven is without a doubt a popular, and even historical series. I'm throughly aware of this, especially with my role as Holland Novak. It's a film fans are looking forward to very much, so I've spent a lot of time going over previous works. I warmly welcome everyone that I'll be working with, and I appreciate being able to record in such a nice atmosphere. Holland's intense personality was ultimately a large attraction for me when looking at this work, and I'm convinced I'll be able to re-discover his charm throughout the three films. I look forward to watching Eureka Seven evolve with you. Returning once again to voice pilot Talho Yuuki is the ever-talented Michiko Neya. From Fullmetal Alchemist to Initial D, Michiko is truly a voice actor that has done it all. You can find her comment regarding the film below: Not just for the sake of nostalgia, but I'm truly looking forward to these new Eureka Seven films. Because of it's nature as a trilogy, let's look forward to each installment together. Another returning patron to the series, Juurouta Kosugi will be tackling the role of Charles Beams head on. Best known for his roles in the original JoJo's Bizarre Adventures OVA's, as well as the Mobile Suit Gundam series, Juurouta knows how to pick his characters. His comment can be found below: To be honest, I'd like to be a man like Charles. Both Charles and I are the real deal, I think. Love and faith... Let's just meet in the theater! You better bring another handkerchief too!! Everyones favorite mom is back! Returning to voice Ray Beams is Aya Hisakawa. With the experience of series such as Dragon Ball Z and Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 behind her back, it'll be exciting to see what she brings to the trilogy. Her comment can be found below: Though the setting has changed ever so slightly, the personality of the ideal mother who loves Charles and loves Renton like her own son is the same as always. I was extremely glad to be playing Ray again after all this time. Last but absolutely not least is the incredibly talented Toru Furuya, or you may know him as Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon. Taking on the prestigious role of Adroc Thurston, the esteemed father of Renton Thurston, this will be Toru Furuya's first time working with the series. His comment can be found below: I became engrossed in Adroc's personality, and my regular thought circuits didn't operate properly for about two days. It's a symptom that only ever appears when I'm perfectly combined with a role. I felt a pleasant pressure during the voice over sessions, but at times it was quite challenging. I'm proud I could act as a centerpiece to the series' story, and I believe I truly created something legendary. Set to release September 16 across Japan, the first entry into the Eureka Seven trilogy is looking like it's something not to be missed.

11376|2017-05-17|10:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/discussions-001-ujico/| Interview | N/A | discussions.001// Tokyo-Based Producer Ujico*/Snail’s House | We sit down and chat with budding producer Ujico/Snail's House regarding the massive plans he has leading into the end of the year. |Today I had the unique opportunity to sit down and chat with one of Japan's most creative young minds, Ujico*/Snail's House. The now 20-year old producer is currently working on a collaborative piece with French producer Moe Shop at the time of our talking; discussing inside his recently moved-into first apartment. To say that Ujico is a prodigy would be an understatement. Within just three years, the creative has managed to release well over 100 tracks bridging both physical and digital formats. On top of this, he's worked closely with popular arcade series' Beatmania IIDX and Taiko no Tatsujin to include his music in their latest entries. Apart from an English-language interview he conducted with Red Bull Radio some couple of months ago, there's always been an air of mystery surrounding the producer. Besides an active Twitter account run by Ujico himself, there's few platforms to truly learn about him. We've gone ahead and attempted to bridge that information gap, especially as the producer gears up for an extremely busy 2017: Before we get too into things, can you tell me a little bit about how your Ujico*/Snail's House project started? It's been about three years since I started at this point, back in 2014. I was listening to a Japanese jazz musician called Hiromi Uehara, and I was shocked by the skill in which she could play keys. I never considered myself a piano player, more-so just a hobbyist. But when I heard that Hiromi was performing in places like New York with her incredible music, I couldn't help but give it a go. Her song 'Spiral’ in particular made me want to try out the piano. The name 'Ujico' was actually a childhood nickname that I'm not quite sure why I received. One day my friend decided to call me it, and it just kind of stuck with me. You've got a whole lot on your plate right now, between hitting the 70,000 follower milestone on SoundCloud, and a multitude of your tracks breaking the 1,000,000 play-count on YouTube, what's going on in the world of Ujico lately? It's actually kind of crazy, there's a lot of my tracks that are getting so much more than a million plays now. There's one that's recently broken 2,000,000 and another that's over 3,000,000. As for what I've been doing, not much has changed since I first started. My music has certainly helped me reach new heights, but I've always been comfortable doing what I've been doing. I enjoy the pace that I can operate at, and I think that's really important. If someone was to tell the Ujico of three years ago that he would have a following of 70,000+ on SoundCloud alone, as well as that you'd have played internationally, would you believe it? I mean, I still kinda don't believe it. Even now I'm still very much at the point where if someone was to come back in time and tell me of my success in the future, I wouldn't be able to wrap my head around it. I'm extremely humbled by how far I've gotten, but I'd be lying if I said that I understood the success. I make music that I enjoy, and I'm happy that other people can come to enjoy it too. Just over a year ago you were sitting at 20,000 followers, would you say there was any one song that you would attribute your success to? Honestly, there's probably about four songs that I would truly consider my reason for growth. The first would be a release I did on Trekkie Trax called 'Nyan Nyan Angel!'. It got a lot of support in Japan from artists like DJ Wildparty and Masayoshi Iimori, which helped grow my following in Japan a lot. But I think my biggest breakthrough moment would be when I released a song called 'Ma Chouchoute' through Tasty Network. I originally uploaded it to my SoundCloud and reached out to a friend of mine who had a following of about 10,000 to repost it. Following that, it went viral within it's first week. This is where I started to reach a more international audience. Three weeks later I re-released the song through Tasty Network where it would then go on to spawn a few viral meme videos. Other than those two, my biggest successes would have to be 'Grape Soda', and 'Ramune', which I still consider to be one of my greatest works. So what can we expect to see next from Ujico? Have you got any big plans for the rest of this year? I've got three physical releases this year, as well as 'Ordinary Songs 3' coming out soon. I can't go into too much detail about the physical releases, but there's a lot I'm very excited about. As for 'Ordinary Songs 3', I've worked very hard on it to ensure that it's as good as it's predecessors. The first release was simply an archive of free music for fans, but it contained some real gems. I'm pretty happy with the progress of the third installment though, and I believe it contains one of my best songs ever, 'Lullaby'. Where is it that you pull inspiration from? Or rather, what is it that inspires you to make music? I derive a lot of inspiration from images, especially animated ones. Illustrations of views have been the basis for so many of my works, so it's something I'm always looking for. When I look at an image, I like to imagine what's going on within that world, and then try and make music that would accompany everything that is going on inside of it. That's probably where I pull most of my inspiration from. How would you describe your music to someone who hasn't heard it before? I like to make the kind of music that I would listen to myself, and lately I've been spending a lot of time working in my bedroom. So I guess that's the kind of vibe it's got, almost like the kind of music you would listen to from within your bedroom. I used to go to the clubs a lot, but more recently I've grown tired of that, so maybe there's been an evolution in my sound. In the past you worked with the team at Attack the Music to perform in North America for your first ever international live performance. Would you look at performing internationally again in the future? Absolutely, I'm always looking forward to opportunities like that. I enjoy meeting fans from overseas, and always appreciate the chance to get booked in a foreign country. I have a very global audience, so being able to perform for all of them is extremely special to me. Thank you for your time! Thank you. If you're interested in checking out more of Ujico's works, he's recently begun uploading to his YouTube channel, as well as his always-active SoundCloud account. He can also be found on Twitter where you'll often find him interacting with fans from all around the globe.|Ujico, Snail's House, electronic, Music, Discussions, Moe Shop, Tasty Network, Trekkie Trax

It's a goal that was first, in part, realized when Universal Studios Japan unveiled their Evangelion XR Ride. This ride would place guests on a high-speed rollercoaster whilst wearing a virtual reality helmet, plunging them headfirst into the midst of a fight between both an EVA unit and angel. But while this was cool, there was most definitely something missing from it; and this upcoming collaboration with Bandai Namco aims to fix this. I've been a long-time fan of the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise, and I've always been equally as excited about the potentials of VR technology. So whenever news like this gets revealed, it's always such an exhilarating feeling of overwhelming excitement. The upcoming collaborative project between Bandai Namco and the Evangelion franchise will be titled "Evangelion VR: The Throne of Souls", and is going to be made available at Bandai Namco's VR Zone in Shinjuku. I'm already super sold on the whole concept, especially after going through some of the details on the official website. You're pitted up against the 10th angel as it attempts to destroy Tokyo-3. Joining you at your side are two companions in the accompanying EVA units. Within your virtual reality confines, you're placed into the EVA entry plug as you undergo LCL immersion, A10 nerve synchronization, and sync ratio measurement as if you were truly about to go up against the 10th angel. In the past, Bandai Namco have also conducted virtual reality experiences featuring franchises such as Doraemon. I've gone ahead and shared that above, as it's definitely worth checking out just what you'll be getting yourself into. The upcoming "Evangelion VR: The Throne of Souls" is set to become available during Summer, exclusively at VR Zone.

It's been a little over 2 months since then, and that's over 60 days worth of content from both new and returning favorites. I'm absolutely in love with a lot of the new emerging artistic styles I've been seeing lately, and it's always great to be able to share them with everyone. These are the online illustrators that represent the next generation of creatives. Going against the norms set by their peers, they continue to innovate and push forward, carving their own niche through their following. I've done my best to select a few diverse styles, but ultimately what I'm sharing is the art that I've been enjoying the most as of late. So without further ado, here are some of my absolute favorite Twitter illustrations from the last couple of months: 帰る時間 pic.twitter.com/timsYb4wml — のり熊 (@kumainori) 11 May 2017 @kumainori 「帰る時間」 If you weren't already familiar with the artistic talents of kumainori, they're a creative who presents themselves through their stylish fixation on pale color palettes. Shaping an entire world around these shades, the illustrator often blends ecstatic, high-activity backgrounds with relatively simple characters. Don't let that fool you though, as these characters are far from bland, standing on their own as unique and gorgeous illustrations. Originally creating their Twitter account on April of 2017, the artist rapidly amassed a following of just under 5,000 active users.

This illustration in particular is a perfect example of their style, almost seeming as if it had been pinched straight out of a well drawn manga series. Their use of striking colors when working on their characters always largely-drawn eyes makes for such a unique and graceful style. I'm completely and totally obsessed with their illustrations, and it's always exciting to see what comes next from them. Originally creating their Twitter account on January of 2014, the artist commands a dedicated following of just under 6,000 users.

But, you know I'm gonna give one anyway. pippi913 is an illustrator who perfectly creates an all-immersive universe within the confines of their artworks. Largely focused on the Pokémon franchise, pippi913 flawlessly illustrates carefully detailed backgrounds accompanied by equally detailed characters stemming from one of the most recognized game series' of all time. Originally creating their Twitter account on May of 2013, the artist maintains an ever-growing following of just over 25,000.

Her latest artwork is a cover jacket for emerging idol group 'Happy Kuru Kuru' featuring her distinct style coupled with a magical girl theme. Her vibrant mix of fantasy and escapism is especially prevalent in this work, flawlessly blending various locations and colors without a single issue. Synonymous with the music it accompanies, kiato's works are always a visual treat to look forward to. Originally creating their Twitter account in December of 2009, kiato maintains an ever-growing following of over 7,000.

This piece is especially interesting, as it's embedded into a thread of tweets extending back all the way to May, 2016 with an entry added every month until now. It represents the ever-changing art-style that nomuuuuuuro is capable of, and shows a developmental growth in ability over 12 short months.

11490|2017-05-11|08:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-escape/| News | Anime , Manga | There's a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Escape Room Event Coming | There's a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable escape room coming to both Tokyo and Osaka in the coming months, and we're seriously excited. |During my research today, there were two equally interesting things I discovered; Firstly, there's a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable escape room event coming to both Tokyo and Osaka. Secondly, the famed Tokyo Dome City where the event is actually being held used to be called 'Big Egg City', which is outright hilarious -- more on that later. I've been a long-time fan of the JoJo series, so seeing events like this is always such a treat, especially on the 30th anniversary of the series. Based on the series' fourth part, 'Diamond is Unbreakable, the escape game pits players in a scenario where they must defeat antagonist Kira Yoshikage. In fighting through the relentless attacks of his stands Sheer Heart Attack and Killer Queen, only then will players true "stand" unlock. It's a game filled with mystery and excitement that I can only hope lives up to the level of excitement I have for it. If you're not familiar with escape the room, it's a genre of games popularized by this neat little browser game called 'Crimson Room' that released in 2004. The mechanics are simple; players get tasked with finding various items, as well as clues, to eventually escape from a mysterious room they find themselves trapped in. The genre became so widely popularized online that it eventually found it's way into real-life scenarios.

11491|2017-05-09|14:30|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/toho-animation-op-youtube/| News | Anime | TOHO Makes Its Airing Anime OP's Available on YouTube | For just a minute at a time, I feel like I can truly express the excitement that built up over the span of that week-long duration between episodes. |Anime songs are getting good -- like, really undeniably good. That's not saying they were ever bad; but I feel like there's been a lot of truly high quality songs accompanying anime throughout the last decade. For just a minute and a half at a time, I feel like I can truly express the excitement that built up over the span of that week-long duration between episodes. But sometimes I don't want to wait an entire week to scream along to these series-defining songs. Until recently, the idea of going online and finding an official stream of any series OP or ED was such a wild concept. But it looks like TOHO Animation over the last year has been taking the first steps to change this. If you're at all familiar with the hype-inducing breakthrough series 'My Hero Academia', you're most definitely familiar with it's equally exciting OP track. It's a series that has me emotionally hooked on a multitude of levels, and that all kicks off with Kenshi Yonezu's 'Peace Sign'. And with the song coupled with gorgeous animation from the talented team at Studio Bones, there's so many reasons to get excited. So you know what? The fact that I can simply go onto YouTube and visit TOHO Animation's account to hear it whenever I feel like doing so is super overwhelming. While it appears to currently be limited to TOHO Animation, it would be a massive stride forward to see other Japanese publishers jump on board utilizing their own channels. The ability to stream TrySails hyperactive ED 'adrenaline!!!', coupled with the imagery of Sagiri dancing around the laundry room, would be on repeat through my speakers indefinitely. That's if Aniplex would make it available, of course. What also makes part of TOHO's approach so great is their lack of region-restriction on video content. Making the clips available to everyone in the world, regardless of geographic location. The same can't be said for global fans trying to officially stream something like 'adrenaline!!!' through Sony Music Japan's official channel. There's a lot of invisible borders up between the Japanese animation industry and the rest of the world right now, and I only hope to see this change in the near future. The industry will thrive off accessibility, and it's important that we continue to move forward in doing so. I can't wait to see more publishers and content creators jump on board with this trend, as it's these little things that brings global fans together even more.

The one where the AI would develop its own opinions and feelings based on its interactions with various online users? The one that ended with an innocent "teenage girl" expressing some of the most vulgar aspects of the internet? Well, it looks like Ayase Aragaki from 'Oreimo' will be getting her own self-learning AI chatbot that works in a similar way. And with how well experiments like this have gone in the past, what could go wrong? Announced at the stage event for Tsukasa Fushimi's latest light novel series 'Eromanga Sensei', the 'Ayase Interactive AI-Raising Project' invites fans to submit and vote on various questions and replies they believe appropriate for the character. From there the AI will develop its own personality based on what was submitted. For example, if there's an onslaught of people who find peace in Ayase's joyful side, interactions will be light-hearted and enjoyable. But if people feel the need to, perhaps, bring out her less-friendly side, there's most definitely going to be some problems; and that's absolutely terrifying. Also announced at the event was a light novel adaptation of Ayase's route from the 2011 PlayStation Portable title 'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai Portable'. The novel will feature revised scenarios and dialogue, as well as additional scenes. It was also added that, if popularity calls for it, the series will continue onwards. Whilst no further information has been detailed, interested fans can keep an eye on Tsukasa Fushimi's Blog for future updates. What are your thoughts, do you think things will run smoothly for this AI experiment? Or do you think this is a total disaster waiting to happen?

11493|2017-05-08|11:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/fate-grand-order-discussion/| News | Anime , Games | 'Fate/Grand Order' is an Unstoppable Force | When it comes to mobile games in Japan, there's few more popular right now than 'Fate/Grand Order', which is soon to receive an English release. |When it comes to mobile games in Japan, there's few more popular right now than 'Fate/Grand Order'. The Aniplex-released fantasy role-playing game has been the subject of countless discussions amongst myself and colleagues. That being said however, I'd be lying if I said I've dropped any extensive amount of time into it. This largely came down to a few language barrier issues and the disappointing lack of official mobile game translation support. That's why when Aniplex announced that they would be publishing the title in North America, in English, I couldn't help but get excited. 'Fate/Grand Order' is a series perhaps best known for putting a unique spin on historical figures, and presenting them in a manner previously unheard of; all while preserving their documented real-life personalities... to an extent. From over the top characters such as Thomas Edison, all the way to the likes of Joan of Arc Part, the game never fails to amuse. But that's not the main reason that people are so infatuated with the game. If you're somehow not familiar with the wildly popular 'Fate/stay night' universe, it's been widely regarded as one of the best visual novels of all time; while also being consistently listed as a fan favorite anime. It's an all-enticing universe that delves in intricacy and detail unlike anything else of its kind. If you're in for one part of the franchise, you're in for it all. So when it was announced mid-last month at Sakura-Con that the title would be receiving an official English release, fans of the franchise were understandably ecstatic. What was for many a tap and pray experience, could now become a very legitimate experience for players. Especially with consistent updates and native language support. In an ideal world, I see it performing similarly, if not better than Nintendo's 2017 smartphone release 'Fire Emblem Heroes' that transformed the series from questionably niche to a first day-earning $2.9 million property. As it stands right now, the title has little competition in the English market of its genre, making it an easy push for Aniplex of America (Now if only they could bring the new 'Madoka Magica' side-story 'Magia Record' over with English support too). Set to release in the Summer of 2017, the game will feature the original Japanese voice overs, with full English subtitles. The game will be receiving simultaneous releases on both iOS and Android, with content available all the way up to chapter 2 on launch. Originally launched in Summer 2015, the title has been downloaded over 8 million times on mobile devices, and commands an active fanbase. It has been reported that players will be unable to transfer save data from Japanese accounts to English accounts, though they will be able to play simultaneously on both. The 'Fate' franchise has been a sizable property in English-speaking markets for the last decade. Since the release of the 2006 animated series 'Fate/stay night', an adaptation of the visual novel of the same name, it's consistently peaked as a major contender amongst many anime communities outside of Japan. In 2016, spinoff entry 'Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star' received a localized release on PlayStation 4, with a Nintendo Switch release on its way. Similarly, we can only hope that the upcoming 'Fate/stay night Heavens Feel' trilogy of films sees an official English release too.

It was probably around the time iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls came out that I started thinking less about the franchise. That being said, I'm not one to shy away from news pertaining to the franchise, and when I saw that there was a new Korean live-action iDOLM@STER series, I was quick to investigate. If you're anything like me, iDOLM@STER.KR probably slipped under your radar. It's an Amazon original series that is simulcasted exclusively on their Amazon Prime Video service whilst it's being aired in South Korea on SBS Plus, SBS funE, and SBS MTV. Set in the Korean idol industry, the show follows the story of eleven hopeful girls pursuing their dreams of becoming idols, similarly to it's animated and video game counterpart. It's being made into a full-24 episode series, with episodes being aired weekly. You can check out Amazon's synopsis for the show below: THE IDOLM@STER.KR, set in the world of Korean entertainment production, stars Korean idols of course, as well as other Japanese and Thai hopefuls. Like the original game, the drama follows a group of young women as they embark on a career in the entertainment industry, and depicts their sweat and tears, their hopes and dreams. The series is being made available globally for members of Amazon Prime Video with subtitles in multiple languages including English and Japanese. Each of the characters in the show will be original, and it's reported that characters from the original game franchise will not be making an appearance.

If you didn't know about it beforehand, you definitely knew about it during -- Japanese television network NHK were listing their top 100 anime of all time. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of Japanese animation, the network took it upon themselves to share their favorite shows of all time. Social media were ablaze with the hashtag #NHKanime100, as thousands upon thousands of viewers shared their thoughts and discussions in real time. The lists were broken down and split into three categories: 'Top 10 Anime Amongst Males', 'Top 10 Anime Amongst Females' and 'Top 10 Anime Overall'. The poll was open to anime fans all across Japan, with some 600,000 votes being received between January 8 to March 31. There were approximately 10,000 anime available for selection spanning the 100 year animation legacy. We've gone ahead and shared the polls below, so let us know what you think about the results: Top 10 Anime Overall: Tiger & Bunny (2011) Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising- (2014) Puella Magi Madoka Magica (2011) Love Live! School idol project - Season One (2013) Love Live! School idol project - Season Two (2014) Tiger & Bunny the Movie: The Beginning (2012) Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006) Card Captor Sakura (1998) Love Live! The School Idol Movie (2015) Osomatsu-san (2015) Top 10 Anime Amongst Males Puella Magi Madoka Magica (2011) Love Live! School idol project - Season One (2013) Love Live! School idol project - Season Two (2014) Love Live! The School Idol Movie (2015) Is the order a rabbit? (2014) The Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988) Girls und Panzer (2012) Mobile Suit Gundam (1979) Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006) Top 10 Anime Amongst Females: Tiger & Bunny (2011) Tiger & Bunny The Movie -The Rising- (2014) Tiger & Bunny the Movie: The Beginning (2012) Osomatsu-san (2015) Joker Game (2016) Gintama (2006) Card Captor Sakura (1998) Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006) Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 (2008) Haikyu!! (2014) It's extremely odd to me that the decision was made to allow multiple entries of the same series in the top 10, but it gives you in-depth look as to what Japanese anime fans are enjoying nonetheless. There's a clear enjoyment of the Tiger & Bunny franchise, especially amongst women, who obviously outnumbered the males in voting numbers. Madoka Magica was the clear favorite amongst males, with Code Geass being the only animated series to cross over into both the male and female top 10 lists. So what are your thoughts, do you agree with this top 10 list or did some of your favorites not quite make the cut?

Set to be animation studio drop's first major entry into the ever-expanding anime market, the studio previously produced the music video for popular Japanese pop group Perfume's 'Mirai no Museum' single. What makes this series in particular so unique, however, is it's peculiar choice of staff for the project. Naoya Ishikawa, put simply, is a one-man studio. Taking pride in hand crafting his own works in full, Naoya has been found serving the roles of director, script-writer, animator and theme-song lyric composer for OVA projects such as Magical Chocolate. After finding modest success in the project, Ishikawa went on to found his own studio under the official moniker: Ishikawa Pro. The trailer below was recently uploaded by the official Clione no Akari YouTube Channel, and features the project's theme song by the same name, performed by former idol group SKE48 member aki. Clione no Akari is the story of a sickly girl named Minori who finds herself seized by constant bouts of school bullying. As her parents had passed away when she was very young, Minori never possessed much money and was always targeted for being poorer than everybody else. The events of the anime will begin on a certain rainy day, two months after Minori was admitted to a hospital in a far off town. Shortly after, Takashi and Kyoko, two of her close school friends, receive a mysterious email with no sender, alerting them of a Summer festival scheduled to take place in a nearby town. This story is based on an original internet novel which began publication in 2004. Author Natural-Rain participated in a unique self-publishing practice in Japan which found aspiring writers circulating their works either on personal websites, or through specially-crafted web novel aggregate sites in order to find an audience of savvy web users, and even cell phone users in a time predating smartphones. Clione no Akari has gone on to become one of Natural-Rain's most popular works, with it's own full story voice-over and an accompanying image song album. In 2007, the novel was an official pick on Yahoo! JAPAN's list of 'Web Novel Masterpieces Sure to Make You Cry'. Finally, the novel was published in print form in 2012 by publisher East Press. The anime is set to begin airing on Tokyo MX and other broadcast stations in Japan beginning July.

11500|2017-04-30|13:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/dempagumi-inc-intro/| News | Music | A Brief Introduction to Japanese Idol Unit 'Dempagumi.inc' | We look into the hyper-energetic world of Akihabara resident idol group 'Dempagumi.inc', as they continue on their quest for worldwide domination. |Let me paint a scene for you real quick; you're in an arena, engulfed in a sea of thousands of likeminded individuals -- suddenly, a colorful bolt of lightning flashes across the stage. Screams of excitement emit from all around you as the crowd rapidly begins to lose their minds. It's at this point six vibrantly dressed idols run onto the stage, completely lighting up the entire arena with their presence. This is, put simply, the Dempagumi.inc concert experience; an experience that I myself can't even begin to express. In my lifetime I've had the absolute pleasure of attending two of Dempagumi.inc's live concerts here in Tokyo, but I'm constantly waiting for an opportunity to attend more. While trying to keep it simple, Dempagumi.inc is an Akihabara-based idol group that consists of six members stemming from various otaku backgrounds. They unify under their shared enjoyment for the hobbies they love, and act as a mainstream voice for the otaku subculture as a whole. Member Nemu Yumemi for example is an outspoken DJ and former resident of Club Mogra, while Mirin Furukawa is an extremely skilled rhythm game player, mostly specializing in Beatmania IIDX. Their interests stem from a wide-range of sources, but put together it presents itself as a hyper-energetic force that is Dempagumi. Roughly 9 years since they first debuted, the group finds themselves commanding sold out arena shows all over Japan. Their unique combination of hyperactive visuals paired with the group's signature vocal flare took very little time to generate an extremely dedicated fanbase. In the last few years, the group has even begun to find international success, performing in locations such as Los Angeles, London, and Paris. With 5 major albums under their name, as well as 16 singles, Dempagumi.inc are a powerhouse that shows little sign of slowing down. In recent years, they have worked closely with numerous big-name Japanese creatives such as the writer and illustrator of Oyasumi Punpun, Inio Asano, and established Harajuku fashion brand Spinns. Pulling inspiration from the fast-paced lifestyles they live, as well as their diverse and eclectic backgrounds, the group always manages to put on a memorable and entrancing performance, regardless of whether it's on or off stage. The group have also worked with animated projects such as Punchline!, Phantom of the Kill and The Disastrous Life of Saiki K to provide both opening songs and ending themes. The groups first album, 'Ne Kite? Uchuu wo Suku no wa, Kitto Osushi... de wa Naku, Dempagumi.inc!' debuted at #132 on the Oricon Weekly Album Chart back in late 2011. Some 5 years later their fourth and fifth albums would go on to rank #3 and #4 respectively. Charting in the first place is an incredible achievement, let alone ranking in the top 5 for three of your five album releases. While the idol industry in Japan is often seen as largely saturated, especially in recent years, Dempagumi.inc continue to stand proud as a testament to the still-present talent in the industry. Proving their creative value time and time again, the group stays on top of their game through the use of unconventional methods and alluring internet-age appeal. It's difficult to predict what the groups next big move will be, but whatever it is, I'm looking forward to it with starry eyes.

There's an extremely distinct feeling to his nostalgia-tinged creation process that I had always longed for; and with the direction his third major album 'Fantasy Club' has been heading, it would seem that the decade of Tofubeats is a long way from ending. So when I saw that Warner Music Japan had begun streaming the music video for his latest track from the album, WHAT YOU GOT, I was understandably excited. The music video which runs for roughly six minutes in duration plays on Tofubeats' signature sitcom style that begun with STAKEHOLDER. Utilizing what we can only imagine is stock footage, the video depicts a series of business employees celebrating, for absolutely no reason. Humorously straying away from the meticulously planned out videos that accompanied tracks such as Suisei and STAKEHOLDER, his latest WHAT YOU GOT playfully matches his internet-centric aesthetic in a manner fitting of such an artist. You've kinda gotta see to understand what we mean though, so the video is embedded below: His forthcoming album Fantasy Club is set to release both physically and digitally on May 24, and will feature a total of 13 tracks. Releasing through Warner Music Japan's sub-label Unborde, the same label that artists such as Kyary Pamyu Pamyu call home, the album will feature guest vocals from YOUNG JUJU and Sugar Me. For those interested in checking out Fantasy Club, it's available for streaming on all major streaming services.

11503|2017-04-28|10:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/new-2ds-xl/| News | Games | The 'New 2DS XL' System Is Nintendo's Best Looking Device | Nintendo's 'New 2DS XL' is the companies best looking console to date, but this far into the console's lifecycle, is it still worth picking up? |I'm gonna come right out and say it -- the recently announced Nintendo New 2DS XL system is Nintendo's best looking device to date. I thought I was sold on the Switch, I really did, but there's something about the color palette and trim to these devices that has me in awe. In what was likely a bid to show Nintendo's commitment to the DS lineup of consoles following the launch of the Switch, it was today announced that the 2DS console would be getting some major touchups. This of course included my favorite change of them all, the total visual redesign. At launch the console will be available in two color combinations -- a striking blue and black mix or an orange on white variant. The consoles will be paired with similarly colored buttons and a gorgeous upper display. It's set to release on July 28 which aligns perfectly with the release of Hey Pikmin and Miitopia for the console. It'll be priced at $150 in North America, and will feature an 82% larger screen than the previous 2DS. Nintendo have released a reveal trailer for the portable console which can be viewed below: As someone who already owns a Nintendo 3DS, I'm definitely not the target audience for the console. But there's a few questions raised as to, well, who that audience is. When the original Nintendo 2DS was announced, a major selling point for it was it's sturdy single-frame build and cheaper price point, making it ideal for younger audiences. The New 2DS XL however features that same dual-frame design that was standardized with the 3DS, raising questions about whether parents are likely to consider this a viable option for their children. For those of you who are fans of gorgeous designs and cheaper prices however, and don't already own a New 3DS console, this could be just the right choice for you.

The series which spanned over 50 episodes, detailed the adventures of Renton Thurston. |It's been 12 years since the original release of Eureka Seven in Japan. The series which spanned over 50 episodes, detailed the interplanetary adventures of Renton Thurston and Eureka as they fought to protect the world. Originally created by Studio Bones and co-produced by Bandai Entertainment in 2005, the series was praised globally for it's stylistic themes and setting. Just last month we received word that the series would be remade in a trilogy of films spanning over the next three years, but that wasn't all Studio Bones had to share. In 2009 there was a super-limited release of Eureka Seven on both Blu-Ray and DVD, sparking interest worldwide. Not only was it extremely difficult to acquire however, it was also extremely expensive. For the last several years it's been somewhat of a illustrious collectors item due to this rarity, but word has today broken that the series will be receiving a commercially available, less-expensive physical re-release. The re-release is going to be made available in two parts, with the first set to release on August 29, 2017 containing the first 26 episodes; while part two will be available on September 27 containing the final 24 episodes. For the blu-ray release you can expect to pay 18,000 yen each, and the DVD release will be similarly priced at 17,000 yen each. Each volume will feature an original character illustration by Kenichi Yoshida. Included in the first volume will be the series OP and ED without credits, including episode 26's sequences. Volume two will include sequences from episodes 33 and 50 without credits, as well as footage from the 2006 Sony Music Anime Festival in Tokyo. The re-release date for the blu-ray falls closely inline with the announcement of the films upcoming trilogy, which is set to screen in Japanese theaters later this year.

11498|2017-04-10|15:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/nico-nico-chokaigi-2017/| News | N/A | 'Nico Nico Chokaigi' Festival Blurs Internet With Reality | 'Nico Nico Chokaigi' is a free-for-all madhouse of internet culture, with prevalent web humor being the selling-point of it all. |This year marked a landmark occasion for online Japanese streaming website 'Nico Nico Douga,' as it celebrated it's 10 year anniversary. As such, it comes as no surprise that the website would go all in on it's yearly 'Nico Nico Chokaigi' festival -- an event that aims to bridge both internet culture and reality into one giant two-day fiesta. The cultural hub operates in a very similar fashion to it's Western counterpart, YouTube, in it's ability to spawn a wide variety of groundbreaking viral content. Unlike YouTube however, whose largest event, VidCon, pulls in some 26,000 fans, the yearly Nico Nico Chokaigi brings in over 150,000 physically present attendees, and almost six million digital attendees. It's a free-for-all madhouse of internet culture, with prevalent web humor being the selling-point of it all. Chances are that if you're not surrounded by muscle men, you're most definitely wading through an endless sea of Touhou cosplayers. All the while, headline events such as the vocaloid dance party call on some of the platform's most creative talents to perform in front of thousands, whilst millions of fans tune in online. It's an absolute frenzy, and truly something that couldn't be experienced anywhere else. For the 10th anniversary festival, we saw major companies such as Nintendo join in on the madness, offering attendees early access to titles such as 'Arms' for the Nintendo Switch. Enormous cosplay shows had starry-eyed attendees running for the stage in the hopes of having their hard work recognized. Hatsune Miku even gave her own Kabuki performance alongside acclaimed Japanese performer Nakamura Shidou, ushering in a unique spin on a century old stage show. The program, which was titled 'Kuruwa Kotoba Awase Kagami', portrayed the love story between both Shidou and Miku. I mean, seriously, it doesn't get much more 'internet' than that. The yearly event which is held in the Chiba prefecture of Japan -- roughly 30 minutes from Tokyo -- continues to grow as a staple part of Japanese net culture year by year. Taken straight from the official website, the event page describes itself by stating "Chokaigi is the melting pot of Japan’s internet culture, where people of all ages can get together in real life and enjoy face-to-face communication." By breaking down the barriers between 'internet' and 'real life' cultures, Nico Nico Chokaigi offers it's whole as a social event, rather than a more traditional event focused on promotion, and I think that's why it performs so well on a global scale.

Back in July 2015, Zekk uploaded a doujin remix of Gurren Lagann OP 'SoraIro Days' to SoundCloud. Since then it's received almost 20,000 plays from fans all over the world, flawlessly blending elements of J-core with Shoko Nakagawa's powerful lyrics. So when I saw that Zekk had uploaded a 2017 revision of this remix to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Gurren Lagann, I was quick to grab my headphones and take a listen. Almost instantly I was overwhelmed with an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia -- a longing for ten years prior where I found myself captivated in the often chaotic universe Gainax had offered me. What Zekk manages to do within the constraints of 5 minutes 15 seconds is incredible, as a slew of emotions breaks down into the desire to frantically move along to the songs hyper-active pace. This is a remix that could be enjoyed by those who never experienced the original series and long-time fans alike, and that's part of what makes this track so great. In light of this, I reached out to Zekk to get a few words about this remix; his comments can be found below: During my childhood, I was totally captivated in the world of Gurren Lagann. I've always been a fan of Studio Gainax's works, but Gurren Lagann in particular has been a major inspiration. I think it weighed in greatly on the value I hold for my music in general too. I'm so glad that the series has reached it's 10th anniversary, and because of this I wanted to share the same joy I feel with other fans of the series around the world. That's why I chose to remix 'SoraIro Days', and I really hope you guys enjoy it. Thank you, Gainax. Originally released on April 1, 2007, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann stood as the entry-point for an entire generation of anime fans. Taking viewers on a 27 episode whirlwind journey throughout the galaxy, the show was met with critical acclaim upon release both domestically and internationally. It was awarded an 'Excellence Prize' at the 2007 Japan Media Arts Festival, and the following year was awarded 'Best Television Production' and 'Best Character Design' at the Tokyo Anime Awards.

The first entry into the trilogy, Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution, is set to release in 2017 across Japan. In light of this, we reached out to Dai Sato to briefly discuss his thoughts on the trilogy, as well as what he has been working on over the last 12 years. Best known for his work on series such as Cowboy Bebop, Eureka Seven and Ghost in the Shell: SAC, Dai Sato has played a lasting role in the animation industry. In 2006 he was awarded 'best screenplay' at the Tokyo International Anime Fair for his substantial work on Eureka Seven. The following year in 2007 Dai Sato went on to establish his own company, Storyriders. It's been 12 years now since the original Eureka Seven series ended. What projects have you been involved in since then? I've been working with various video game-related releases such as 'Resident Evil: Revelations 1 & 2', 'Halo: Legends' and 'Tekken: Blood Vengeance', as well as animated series' such as 'Space Dandy' and 'Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine'. I was also responsible for various animated kids shows such as 'Battle Spirits', 'Puzzle & Dragon Cross' and 'JOKER'. What kind of changes can we expect to see in the trilogy? A lot has happened in the last 12 years, do you think your thought process when working on anime has changed at all? When I originally worked on this series 12 years ago, anime was still very much 'counter-culture'. These days though, it's almost become a part of every day life for society. Because of this, we're really looking at what we can do with the series. Shortly after the announcement of the rebooted trilogy, 'Eureka Seven' was at the top of the trending terms on Twitter. What kind of an impact are you hoping to leave on the animation scene with these films? While I was pleasantly surprised by the positive reaction fans of 'Eureka Seven' gave to the announcement, I also want to build that much excitement amongst people who will be watching the series for the first time too. I want to leave a strong impact on those new people, just as I want to for the original fans. The upcoming trilogy, which will act as a retelling of the original 50 episode series, will include remade animation and audio, as well as additional scenes. The trilogy is set to build on the 'Summer of Love' anomaly that occurred 10 years prior to the original story, offering viewers a healthy dose of fresh content mixed in with the story they know and love. The team working on the trilogy will consist largely of the series’ original staff, including script-writer and OTAQUEST co-founder Dai Sato, alongside chief director Tomoki Kyoda. Also working on the upcoming trilogy are Kenichi Yoshida, Shoji Kawamori, Kazutaka Miyatake, and Shingo Takeba, amongst a team of returning and fresh talent. Originally aired in North America through Adult Swim, the series was met with wide-spread approval. Following the story of protagonist Renton Thurston, audiences were invited on a 50-episode journey through the skies as Renton’s entirely boring life got turned upside-down.

11356|2017-03-18|10:00|Lachlan Johnston|http://otaquest.com/eureka-seven-cultural-references/| Interview | N/A | Dai Sato Discusses Eureka Seven Cultural References and Film | OTAQUEST Co-Founder and Eureka Seven script-writer Dai Sato recently sat down with block.FM to discuss the counter-cultural views of the animated series. |In a recent interview with Japanese radio station block.FM, OTAQUEST Co-Founder Dai Sato sat down and discussed the various themes and references of the Eureka Seven series. The interview, which was in light of the recent announcement that the series would be receiving three feature-length films spanning the next three years, was largely focused on the often counter-cultural Japanese viewpoints presented in the original 2005 animated series. The interview which was conducted in Japanese has been translated to English for Western-audiences. The full interview can be found below: In the original Eureka Seven series, there was a lot of influence taken from the early electronic music scene. What is it going to be like this time? Multiple times in the show we made reference to the term 'Acperience', which originates from the German techno group Hardfloor. The fact we asked them to do music for us really confirms this fact. Up until now, they had released 5 tracks in their 'Acperience' series, but we asked them to create a 7th to better fit the film title, Eureka Seven. You have put a lot of references to counter-cultural movements in the anime, such as 'Grand Royal' (Beastie Boys' label) and snowboarding. Are we going to be seeing similar references in this movie? Absolutely. The term "Summer of Love" itself is even coined from counter-cultural movements. This will be the first time we're creating the "First Summer of Love" scene. As the Chief Script Writer, how did you plan to confront these films? Trying to recreate an anime we made 12 years ago is always going to be a challenge, but our team is doing their best to create a masterpiece. We want to create fresh moments for new viewers, yet pack it full of surprises for longtime fans. The first film in the upcoming trilogy, 'Eureka Seven: Hi-Evolution', is set to release in 2017, with the following films releasing in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Originally aired 12 years ago in 2005, the series was met with widespread approval, securing its place as one of the industries most treasured original animated series.
